| 0:09:30| Now I just wanted to say a couple announcements on regular city business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=570)|
| 0:09:37| We have a meeting next Tuesday, January 21st, at the John T. O'Connor Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=577)|
| 0:09:43| and this is going to be hosted by what was formerly known as the Community Development Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=583)|
| 0:09:48| but now we are calling the Housing and Neighborhood Development Staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=588)|
| 0:09:51| and it's a consolidated plan to identify community needs and priorities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=591)|
| 0:09:56| our blueprint for how we're going to use the federal funds through HUD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=596)|
| 0:10:00| and the Community Development Block Grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=600)|
| 0:10:03| So this helps with homeless services, blight remediation, and economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=603)|
| 0:10:08| So obviously council members are welcome to attend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=608)|
| 0:10:11| but we especially invite members of the public to attend and share their input and ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=611)|
| 0:10:16| And again, this is next Tuesday, the 21st, the John T. O'Connor Center at 6 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=616)|
| 0:10:22| at 611 Winona Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=622)|
| 0:10:27| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=627)|
| 0:10:28| And last announcement, or is that last?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=628)|
| 0:10:32| No, not quite last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=632)|
| 0:10:33| Getting close to the end, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=633)|
| 0:10:36| Before I took office, city council had asked for a report on body cameras for the police department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=636)|
| 0:10:42| and I just wanted to update you that we are reviewing that information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=642)|
| 0:10:48| and I'm hopefully going to have a recommendation to you before the end of this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=648)|
| 0:10:55| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=655)|
| 0:10:56| And I'll share that with you as soon as we're ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=656)|
| 0:11:02| And I appreciate all the work that KPD has done to review body-worn cameras,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=662)|
| 0:11:07| and Chief Thomas and I are looking forward to sharing more information as soon as I'm ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=667)|
| 0:11:12| I just want to mention that the delay is on my part, not on KPD's part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=672)|
| 0:11:16| So I just wanted to clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=676)|
| 0:11:19| Starting this week, we have a celebration of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=679)|
| 0:11:24| and I want to thank the Commemorative Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=684)|
| 0:11:28| It's a labor of love that's done by volunteers who make a week-long group of activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=688)|
| 0:11:35| You can go to MLKKnoxville.com to see a full listing of events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=695)|
| 0:11:39| Tomorrow I'm going to be attending, along with many others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=699)|
| 0:11:42| the Interfaith Prayer Service at Community Evangelistic Church at 2650 Boyds Bridge Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=702)|
| 0:11:49| On Thursday is the luncheon at Rothschild Catering Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=709)|
| 0:11:54| That's Thursday, January 16th, the Martin Luther King, Jr. Leadership Awards Luncheon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=714)|
| 0:12:00| That's always a great event, recognizing the many contributions of people in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=720)|
| 0:12:04| in the tradition of Martin Luther King's work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=724)|
| 0:12:08| Saturday, I invite you all to come run with me at the YWCA Race Against Racism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=728)|
| 0:12:14| It's not an early morning race, which is good. I'm not an early morning person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=734)|
| 0:12:18| But it's at 1 p.m., and we start and finish at the YWCA Phyllis Wheatley Community Center at 124 South Cruz Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=738)|
| 0:12:25| And for people who are not big runners, lots of people walk, and it's a pretty flat course, and it's a good cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=745)|
| 0:12:31| So come on out and join us for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=751)|
| 0:12:34| As you all know, probably, city offices are closed Monday to commemorate Dr. King's legacy and service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=754)|
| 0:12:40| And instead of coming to work, I invite you all to come to the parade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=760)|
| 0:12:44| The parade steps off at 10 a.m. at the Midway in Chilhowee Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=764)|
| 0:12:48| and then following the parade, there's an 1145 a.m. service at Overcoming Believers Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=768)|
| 0:12:55| And that concludes my announcements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=775)|
| 0:12:58| Do I have any announcements from city council members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=778)|
| 0:13:02| Councilwoman Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=782)|
| 0:13:04| Thank you, Mayor. I just wanted to let everyone know, if you haven't seen already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=784)|
| 0:13:08| I sent out my official letter of resignation to council today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=788)|
| 0:13:12| I will continue to serve the 1st District until the 16th of February and have really loved my time on council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=792)|
| 0:13:20| But I'll be here for a couple more meetings, so I'll look forward to seeing folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=800)|
| 0:13:25| I'm very excited that I'll be serving the city in a new way in my role with the mayor's administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=805)|
| 0:13:31| and I'll continue to see you in that role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=811)|
| 0:13:34| So just wanted to make sure everyone saw that. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=814)|
| 0:13:38| Thank you. Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=818)|
| 0:13:40| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=820)|
| 0:13:42| This morning I was the pronouncer for the spelling bee at West Hills Elementary School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=822)|
| 0:13:47| and I had invited some of our friends from West Hills to come join us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=827)|
| 0:13:51| I don't know if any of our students came.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=831)|
| 0:13:54| No? Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=834)|
| 0:13:56| Well, they had a busy day spelling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=836)|
| 0:13:58| I had to admit to them that I may not have been the best speller when I was in school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=838)|
| 0:14:03| so they took it easy on me as the pronouncer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=843)|
| 0:14:07| But I did want to congratulate the kids for doing such a good job and for doing their best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=847)|
| 0:14:13| And the winner was Declan Morales, and the runner-up was Alex Brodsky,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=853)|
| 0:14:19| and I told them that I would announce that in my report today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=859)|
| 0:14:22| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=862)|
| 0:14:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=863)|
| 0:14:25| Councilwoman Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=865)|
| 0:14:36| Can you hear me now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=876)|
| 0:14:37| Yep. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=877)|
| 0:14:38| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=878)|
| 0:14:41| Ooh, are you turning my mic off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=881)|
| 0:14:45| Just kidding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=885)|
| 0:14:47| I just wanted to announce that as the representative on the KTA, the Knoxville Transportation Authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=887)|
| 0:14:55| we have our first board meeting of the year coming up January 23rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=895)|
| 0:15:01| So I wanted to let everyone know that that's open to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=901)|
| 0:15:04| It takes place in this room, the main assembly room of the city-county building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=904)|
| 0:15:09| and it's at 3 p.m. on Thursday, January 23rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=909)|
| 0:15:14| I just had my orientation as a new board member and just wanted to quickly thank Melissa Roberson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=914)|
| 0:15:21| and her folks over at CAP for spending some time with me and helping me get oriented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=921)|
| 0:15:27| and also to Vice Mayor McKenzie for helping facilitate that transition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=927)|
| 0:15:32| I'm looking forward to serving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=932)|
| 0:15:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=935)|
| 0:15:36| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=936)|
| 0:15:38| I just am going the order I saw the lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=938)|
| 0:15:40| It's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=940)|
| 0:15:42| So I actually want to give a public service announcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=942)|
| 0:15:47| Unfortunately, there was a fire in our neighborhood this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=947)|
| 0:15:52| It was a triplex where we had a couple people lose their home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=952)|
| 0:15:57| and the neighbors would like to thank KFD for coming out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=957)|
| 0:16:03| There were no losses except for, unfortunately, a couple of pets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=963)|
| 0:16:07| I would like to take this opportunity to recognize Chief Sharp| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=967)|
| 0:16:11| to give everybody a reminder of some safety tips that we need to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=971)|
| 0:16:16| There are often fires in the winter due to different things like space heaters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=976)|
| 0:16:20| I'm not sure what the cause was or anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=980)|
| 0:16:22| but my neighbors and I are very concerned and want to make sure people take some ideas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=982)|
| 0:16:28| and take this as a learning step to look at your own home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=988)|
| 0:16:31| So I'm going to give Chief Sharp a moment to address those things he's more familiar with than I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=991)|
| 0:16:36| Councilwoman Ryder, yeah, I would like to say we do have a public fire education division,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=996)|
| 0:16:41| and they will come out and do a variety of classes to community groups on fire safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1001)|
| 0:16:47| You can look that up on the website, the city's website, or you can call my office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1007)|
| 0:16:53| It's 595-4480, or you can always just call 311, and they can set that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1013)|
| 0:16:59| But one of the most important things you can do is make sure you have a working smoke alarm in your home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1019)|
| 0:17:05| If you live inside the city, you live in a single-family home, if you do not have one, we will come and install one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1025)|
| 0:17:12| We'll change out the batteries if they need to be changed out, or we'll just check them for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1032)|
| 0:17:16| So that is really the most important thing that you can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1036)|
| 0:17:19| is to make sure that you have a working smoke alarm so that if there is a fire, you can get out quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1039)|
| 0:17:24| In the winter, actually, the most common cause of fires are cooking, improper cooking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1044)|
| 0:17:32| But during the winter, obviously, we have an increase due to people heating improperly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1052)|
| 0:17:39| having combustibles too close to it, and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1059)|
| 0:17:43| So there's lots of precautions, but we would be glad to come out and do fire safety training to any community group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1063)|
| 0:17:50| So I know my neighborhood has asked for that after what happened last night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1070)|
| 0:17:54| and so I encourage everyone watching to reach out and call 311 and do that for your own neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1074)|
| 0:18:01| and please check your smoke alarms and make sure they work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1081)|
| 0:18:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1084)|
| 0:18:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1085)|
| 0:18:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1086)|
| 0:18:07| Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1087)|
| 0:18:08| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1088)|
| 0:18:09| I just wanted to let everyone, make them aware that City Council will be having a special workshop on Thursday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1089)|

| 0:23:45| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1425)|
| 0:23:46| I was wondering, is Rebecca Jane Montgomery here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1426)|
| 0:23:49| Rebecca Jane or Ms. Montgomery, would you mind coming up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1429)|
| 0:23:53| I just have a couple of questions for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1433)|
| 0:23:55| While you're coming up, I'll just say I'm really excited, as you can imagine, about this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1435)|
| 0:24:00| But I know it's a big project with multiple phases, and I think particularly for those who are new to Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1440)|
| 0:24:07| it might just be good to get a little reminder of where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1447)|
| 0:24:11| It's sort of a two-phase project, and then there are sub-phases within each phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1451)|
| 0:24:15| So could you just kind of give us an overview, and the project is on budget, and just kind of remind us where we're at with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1455)|
| 0:24:22| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1462)|
| 0:24:23| So this specific contract is part of the original planning and budgeting for the Phase 1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1463)|
| 0:24:30| to complete the Urban Wilderness Gateway Park Project, which was $10 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1470)|
| 0:24:35| We have multiple contracts that will complete the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1475)|
| 0:24:39| Two are currently underway, and the first one was the Baker Creek Preserve Bike Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1479)|
| 0:24:45| and the second is what we call Bid Package 1, which lays out the framework and the infrastructure for the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1485)|
| 0:24:52| So you'll see another contract coming called Bid Package 2, which is the park amenities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1492)|
| 0:24:59| So all of these contracts fulfill the budget and the scoping that was originally planned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1499)|
| 0:25:06| and so it's not new money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1506)|
| 0:25:11| It's just fulfilling that original scope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1511)|
| 0:25:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1514)|
| 0:25:15| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1515)|

| 0:25:45| I just want to add a comment here, why I'm recommending this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1545)|
| 0:25:50| I thought some stats would help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1550)|
| 0:25:52| You're all probably familiar with the big challenge that our police department has faced with not being able to fill their budgeted positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1552)|
| 0:26:00| Just by comparison, in 1993, KPD had 35 openings and several thousand applicants trying to get those jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1560)|
| 0:26:09| In 2020, we have 37 openings and only 92 applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1569)|

| 0:26:24| Nine of those in 2020, another 17 in 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1584)|
| 0:26:28| In addition to that, 51 KPD officers could retire today with full benefits without any further notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1588)|
| 0:26:37| We have a big need to recruit more people to our police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1597)|
| 0:26:42| Also, one thing I learned from all kinds of things is that you can be an excellent police officer and law enforcement professional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1602)|
| 0:26:51| and not be an expert in how to recruit and market people to that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1611)|
| 0:26:55| I think this is a good thing to hire professionals to do this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1615)|
| 0:27:00| I hope that you all will support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1620)|
| 0:27:03| I'm not sure who had their night on first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1623)|
| 0:27:06| Maybe Ms. Parker, Councilwoman Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1626)|
| 0:27:11| There's someone signed up to speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1631)|
| 0:27:13| It's my understanding you usually have the public comment before our discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1633)|
| 0:27:16| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1636)|
| 0:27:17| Okay, let's do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1637)|
| 0:27:18| Keith Britt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1638)|
| 0:27:19| If you could come speak to us, please say your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1639)|
| 0:27:23| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1643)|
| 0:27:24| Keith Britt, 558 Nolton Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1644)|
| 0:27:27| I've come to speak against this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1647)|
| 0:27:30| I have no problem with the amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1650)|
| 0:27:33| I don't think $100,000 is extraordinary or onerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1653)|
| 0:27:38| I have no problem with Robin Easter Designs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1658)|
| 0:27:42| I think that's a fine firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1662)|
| 0:27:45| My problem is it's not addressing the problem we have with recruiting police officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1665)|
| 0:27:53| We know that the problem with getting new police officers is that we simply are not paying them enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1673)|
| 0:28:01| and not giving them a good enough benefits package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1681)|
| 0:28:04| This is not an issue of not having a good enough slogan or snappy enough uniforms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1684)|
| 0:28:08| or a robust social media presence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1688)|
| 0:28:12| If you don't pay and provide adequate benefits for police officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1692)|
| 0:28:16| there's too much competition in this economy for you to get those police officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1696)|
| 0:28:21| There's plenty of well-qualified people in this local area that you can recruit to those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1701)|
| 0:28:26| but you're not offering them the incentive, the financial package they need to carry a mortgage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1706)|
| 0:28:33| carry a car payment, have a stay-at-home parent, pay for daycare if they have two working parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1713)|
| 0:28:40| I know I'm married to a police officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1720)|
| 0:28:42| That's just not a thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1722)|
| 0:28:45| So you're going to need to make some kind of magnitude change in the salary or benefits package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1725)|
| 0:28:51| I hear some very good rumors that there's going to be some paid family leave possibly in the next budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1731)|
| 0:28:59| I fully support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1739)|
| 0:29:01| I think that's going to be great for recruiting very good, qualified young female officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1741)|
| 0:29:06| But I think we're at a tipping point with our police department in the very near future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1746)|
| 0:29:11| You can get more from Chief Thomas on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1751)|
| 0:29:14| But we're going to get to the point where we don't have enough officers to go out to necessary calls for service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1754)|
| 0:29:20| just because our police department is being drained of officers for higher-paying jobs in the local area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1760)|
| 0:29:27| from Y-12 and ORL contractors, mainly Wackenhut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1767)|
| 0:29:32| So you're going to have to make some magnitude change there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1772)|
| 0:29:36| Currently, your starting salary for a Knoxville police officer is $40,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1776)|
| 0:29:40| You just raised that. I commend you on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1780)|
| 0:29:42| That was a very smart move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1782)|
| 0:29:44| It had the intended effect, but it wasn't at the scale that you wanted it to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1784)|
| 0:29:49| So I think you're going to need to make another magnitude change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1789)|
| 0:29:52| and that leading digit in that salary number is really what matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1792)|
| 0:29:55| I think you're probably going to have to step that up to $50,000 to make the tangible change you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1795)|
| 0:30:01| That could potentially cost you roughly $4 million a year if you actually did that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1801)|
| 0:30:09| which is a large number, but I think the cost of doing nothing is much, much more expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1809)|
| 0:30:15| So the reason I urge you to vote no on this resolution is I think it's kicking the can down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1815)|
| 0:30:23| You're making the problem worse by not addressing it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1823)|
| 0:30:26| So this is a hard conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1826)|
| 0:30:29| It may cause you to have discussions about raising, I don't know, property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1829)|
| 0:30:33| I pay property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1833)|
| 0:30:34| This is the one thing that I would say, oh, yeah, please raise my taxes for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1834)|
| 0:30:38| So please address the real issue now, which is that we don't have an adequate benefits package,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1838)|
| 0:30:44| an adequate salary for Knoxville police officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1844)|
| 0:30:47| Advertising is not going to fix this problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1847)|
| 0:30:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1849)|
| 0:30:51| Thank you, Mr. Britt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1851)|
| 0:30:52| Councilwoman Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1852)|
| 0:30:55| I have a couple of comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1855)|
| 0:30:57| My first comment is a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1857)|
| 0:30:59| In response to what Mr. Britt raised, when the city decided to raise the base salary to $40,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1859)|
| 0:31:10| was there a salary survey completed of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1870)|
| 0:31:17| I believe there was a.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1877)|
| 0:31:18| Chief Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1878)|
| 0:31:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1879)|
| 0:31:20| So what we did was we wanted to compare apples to apples and get the real numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1880)|
| 0:31:24| So we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1884)|
| 0:31:26| Out of my office, we actually called area law enforcement agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1886)|
| 0:31:29| We called Nashville, Asheville, Chattanooga to compare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1889)|
| 0:31:34| You say we were making $36,000, and what are the other benefits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1894)|
| 0:31:39| How much is insurance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1899)|
| 0:31:40| Is it the 2.5% raise factored into it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1900)|
| 0:31:43| Is there a raise every year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1903)|
| 0:31:44| So we had a number of things that we compared apples to apples,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1904)|
| 0:31:47| and we felt that at that point $40,000 made us competitive with other agencies in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1907)|
| 0:31:55| So that was done informally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1915)|
| 0:31:57| It did not go through civil service, but we did it through my office, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1917)|
| 0:32:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1920)|
| 0:32:01| And then just the second question, I've seen marketing materials from KPD previously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1921)|
| 0:32:08| aerial shots where there's KPD cars on the bridge and there's lights flashing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1928)|
| 0:32:14| and those are pretty recent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1934)|
| 0:32:17| That seems quite similar to the proposal before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1937)|
| 0:32:21| Can you help me understand what's different?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1941)|
| 0:32:23| That is some very creative police officers that we have and communications manager, our communications manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1943)|
| 0:32:29| All of those things that we have tried, we have a robust recruitment plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1949)|
| 0:32:35| All those things have not worked the way we had hoped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1955)|
| 0:32:38| We've tried all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1958)|
| 0:32:39| We've really worked hard on this, and I went and checked with my peer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1959)|
| 0:32:42| One of my peers is not having any issues, the chief, Dave Roddy in Chattanooga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1962)|
| 0:32:47| And I asked him, I said, what have you done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1967)|
| 0:32:50| And he said, we got a marketing firm to help us advertise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1970)|
| 0:32:53| and to go out and get their demographic that we're looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1973)|
| 0:32:57| And, you know, it costs about a little over $100,000 to train one police officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1977)|
| 0:33:01| We feel like this is a pretty good investment to try this and see if this will work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1981)|
| 0:33:05| and then make it part of our plan moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1985)|
| 0:33:08| And I appreciate Mr. Britt's comments as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1988)|
| 0:33:11| It's not a magic bullet, but I'm hoping it will add to the base that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1991)|
| 0:33:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1998)|
| 0:33:19| Councilwoman Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=1999)|
| 0:33:20| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2000)|
| 0:33:21| I was going to ask a similar thing about are there other police departments that have tried this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2001)|
| 0:33:25| and has it been effective?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2005)|
| 0:33:27| You were saying Chattanooga has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2007)|
| 0:33:28| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2008)|
| 0:33:29| Are there many differences between the Chattanooga police force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2009)|
| 0:33:32| and some of the things that have gone on here with the police force?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2012)|
| 0:33:36| As far as I'm aware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2016)|
| 0:33:38| I guess we've been in the news a lot lately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2018)|
| 0:33:40| That's Chattanooga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2020)|
| 0:33:41| They've been in quite a bit too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2021)|
| 0:33:43| Okay, that's what I was checking to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2023)|
| 0:33:44| So a lot of similar problems across the nation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2024)|
| 0:33:47| And Chattanooga is the only place I've found that has really been able to have full classes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2027)|
| 0:33:51| full recruit classes that's local close by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2031)|
| 0:33:54| Is there something else that they're doing, or do you feel it's just the advertising?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2034)|
| 0:33:58| Because that seems like I can't imagine it making that much of a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2038)|
| 0:34:02| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2042)|
| 0:34:03| As I've said, we're competitive with them as far as paying benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2043)|
| 0:34:06| So that was the one thing we haven't tried that they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2046)|
| 0:34:09| And I felt, like I said, it was a pretty good bang for our buck| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2049)|
| 0:34:12| if we look at what it costs to train a police officer and go out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2052)|
| 0:34:16| Our recruitment budget since I've started,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2056)|
| 0:34:19| well, actually I went into the recruitment unit in 1997, was $2,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2059)|
| 0:34:24| We spent that sending police officers to colleges and military bases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2064)|
| 0:34:28| It allowed us to make five, six trips a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2068)|
| 0:34:31| We didn't have a lot of follow-up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2071)|
| 0:34:33| And so we were able to do a lot more with the money that was budgeted for us last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2073)|
| 0:34:38| And so, in fact, our recruitment officer, Jawan Hamilton,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2078)|
| 0:34:42| is out I believe today at a military base working on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2082)|
| 0:34:47| And then he's headed to a college in North Carolina as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2087)|
| 0:34:51| So we're really trying to not just use this marketing plan but use that money wisely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2091)|
| 0:34:55| We wrapped the two vehicles, I think Councilwoman Parker had mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2095)|
| 0:35:00| And we put those in front of the stadium on football game days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2100)|
| 0:35:03| We're trying to be very strategic with what we have, but we're not professionals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2103)|
| 0:35:07| So we're kind of a hit and miss, although we've done some good work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2107)|
| 0:35:10| I've been really impressed with what our folks have come up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2110)|
| 0:35:13| Is this trying to target a certain demographic, women, people of color?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2113)|
| 0:35:17| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2117)|
| 0:35:18| Diversity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2118)|
| 0:35:19| We have had an affirmative action plan since I came on in 1993| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2119)|
| 0:35:22| where we want to reflect our community demographics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2122)|
| 0:35:25| And so, yes, ma'am, we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2125)|
| 0:35:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2127)|
| 0:35:29| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2129)|
| 0:35:31| I just want to say I work with young folks all day in a college atmosphere environment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2131)|
| 0:35:37| and I run into folks that have no idea that this is a career option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2137)|
| 0:35:44| So I know it's not the only solution, and I hear Mr. Britt, and I understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2144)|
| 0:35:50| and, you know, I think this is an ongoing thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2150)|
| 0:35:53| We have to look at things from a multifactorial way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2153)|
| 0:35:56| But when I talk to somebody not just at work but in, you know, friends, their children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2156)|
| 0:36:01| these are, you know, kids going to college or done with college, done with high school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2161)|
| 0:36:07| it hasn't occurred to them that this is a career option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2167)|
| 0:36:10| And so I'm like, hey, you know, you can do a ride-along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2170)|
| 0:36:14| You can do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2174)|
| 0:36:15| This is the number you call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2175)|
| 0:36:16| Go ahead and throw my name on there and go check this out as a career option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2176)|
| 0:36:21| So if they don't consider it, it's not in their sphere of consideration, then we are missing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2181)|
| 0:36:28| And that is why we've gone from thousands of applicants to a mere few hundred,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2188)|
| 0:36:33| which makes it hard for us to fill the academies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2193)|
| 0:36:36| And what's the lowest number we've had in one of our recent academies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2196)|
| 0:36:40| We started with 12 in one academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2200)|
| 0:36:42| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2202)|
| 0:36:43| And what's the ideal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2203)|
| 0:36:44| Isn't it like 60 or 80 maybe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2204)|
| 0:36:46| Well, no, the ideal number is probably between 30 and 35 for us to teach effectively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2206)|
| 0:36:50| We're not even getting halfway there for ideal number of starting in the academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2210)|
| 0:36:56| So we're going to perpetually be behind if we don't start figuring out how to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2216)|
| 0:37:02| And so I guess my suggestion to the chief and to the mayor is obviously I know you guys think about this and stress over this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2222)|
| 0:37:09| We all do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2229)|
| 0:37:10| We hear it from our constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2230)|
| 0:37:12| And the only other thing I want to remind people of is I had to call something in one night on a Saturday night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2232)|
| 0:37:19| and then the next day something happened in my neighborhood where we had to call something in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2239)|
| 0:37:25| And one of the officers that responded to the Sunday incident, I happened to say something about the Saturday incident,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2245)|
| 0:37:30| and she said, oh, yeah, I heard that on the radio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2250)|
| 0:37:33| And I said, what do you mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2253)|
| 0:37:35| That was last night at 9 o'clock, and it's 10 a.m. on Sunday or 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2255)|
| 0:37:39| She said, well, I just worked the double back-to-back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2259)|
| 0:37:42| That's not what we want, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2262)|
| 0:37:44| That's just not acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2264)|
| 0:37:45| It wasn't acceptable for her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2265)|
| 0:37:48| It's just not acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2268)|
| 0:37:49| We have to figure out how to get the officer applications up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2269)|
| 0:37:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2275)|
| 0:37:56| Councilwoman Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2276)|
| 0:37:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2278)|
| 0:38:00| So I do support this, and I also don't disagree with Mr. Britt and what he said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2280)|
| 0:38:10| And I think the one thing I would like to say is that this has to be one piece of the overall approach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2290)|
| 0:38:16| and I commend Chief Thomas for reaching out, looking for different recruiting strategies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2296)|
| 0:38:21| because we all know that we're in a critical place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2301)|
| 0:38:25| And I just would urge the mayor and the administration to really look at, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2305)|
| 0:38:31| there's training and development to be had, and then there's retention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2311)|
| 0:38:35| And so, you know, we've got to have the incentives there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2315)|
| 0:38:37| We have to have the pay and the benefits there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2317)|
| 0:38:41| So, you know, all that to say is I just hope we can continue to dig a little deeper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2321)|
| 0:38:47| I know a formal survey hasn't been done, I think, since 2007, along with the informal survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2327)|
| 0:38:55| So, you know, I hope that maybe we can look at that and really start to look at this holistically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2335)|
| 0:39:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2341)|
| 0:39:02| Councilwoman Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2342)|
| 0:39:03| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2343)|
| 0:39:04| I had an opportunity to reach out to Ms. Easter earlier today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2344)|
| 0:39:08| and was very impressed with, you know, one of my questions was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2348)|
| 0:39:11| how are you going to target the demographic that would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2351)|
| 0:39:14| it's not just about coming up with some pretty brochures that will be helpful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2354)|
| 0:39:18| but they really have to speak to the demographic if it's the college student or, you know, women or minorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2358)|
| 0:39:25| And I think that what I learned from her is that the field of expertise that's required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2365)|
| 0:39:31| and the, you know, the work that needs to happen with that is the most important part of the campaign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2371)|
| 0:39:37| So I know that there are several other aspects of this contract that will be executed by Robin Easter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2377)|
| 0:39:45| Would you mind, Chief, or if Ms. Easter would like to speak to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2385)|
| 0:39:49| just to kind of real quickly go through what we're getting for $100,000, which is a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2389)|
| 0:39:55| Is Ms. Easter here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2395)|
| 0:39:57| That would be great because I'm sure she could speak to it much better than I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2397)|
| 0:40:04| Could you just state your name and what you're, yeah, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2404)|
| 0:40:08| Robin Easter from Robin Easter Design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2408)|
| 0:40:11| and this is a joint proposal between Robin Easter Design with Ackerman Marketing and PR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2411)|
| 0:40:17| as a subcontractor to us as part of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2417)|
| 0:40:21| So we expect about 45% of this contract to go into research,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2421)|
| 0:40:31| and research will be discovery with key stakeholders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2431)|
| 0:40:37| There will be surveys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2437)|
| 0:40:39| There will be focus groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2439)|
| 0:40:41| There will be, you know, conversations with community members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2441)|
| 0:40:45| We'll be looking in Knoxville but in other areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2445)|
| 0:40:48| Part of that research will help us determine what areas we might want to recruit from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2448)|
| 0:40:54| The priorities will be in looking for minorities and women to apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2454)|
| 0:41:03| So that is really a crucial part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2463)|
| 0:41:06| And then from that information, what we learn in that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2466)|
| 0:41:10| we will develop a marketing strategy that will include really a marketing playbook| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2470)|
| 0:41:15| that will carry us through everything that we'll do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2475)|
| 0:41:19| A good bit of that will be done, implemented by our team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2479)|
| 0:41:23| There will be some elements that will be carried through by the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2483)|
| 0:41:28| The budget also includes creating sort of a brand approach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2488)|
| 0:41:35| but that is probably a fairly small, that's like maybe 10% of the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2495)|
| 0:41:41| The remainder, 50% to 55%, will go into implementation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2501)|
| 0:41:45| and implementation includes development of collateral materials, advertising,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2505)|
| 0:41:51| just all of the, what we determine the elements that we need are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2511)|
| 0:41:56| It will also include printing and placement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2516)|
| 0:42:00| So there is a good bit of out-of-pocket that will be included in the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2520)|
| 0:42:06| So does that answer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2526)|
| 0:42:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2527)|
| 0:42:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2528)|
| 0:42:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2529)|
| 0:42:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2530)|
| 0:42:11| Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2531)|
| 0:42:12| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2532)|
| 0:42:14| Chief Thomas, I just wanted to ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2534)|
| 0:42:16| I know that we increased the base salary for our police officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2536)|
| 0:42:21| and you may or may not know this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2541)|
| 0:42:23| I think I have an idea, but I don't know that it's fact-checked at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2543)|
| 0:42:28| but is the $40,000 comparable to the starting salary of the sheriff deputies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2548)|
| 0:42:37| I'm sure we check with them, and I don't want to tell you yes for sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2557)|
| 0:42:41| because I know the FOP lobbied both organizations to raise the starting salaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2561)|
| 0:42:46| So without going on the website and checking, I don't want to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2566)|
| 0:42:49| but I would hazard to guess, yes, in my best educated guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2569)|
| 0:42:53| we should be very comparable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2573)|
| 0:42:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2575)|
| 0:42:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2576)|
| 0:42:57| And so that's what I thought, but I did not have the facts in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2577)|
| 0:43:00| And so while I think that any efforts that we can make from advertising| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2580)|
| 0:43:06| to continuing to really push for recruitment with schools and colleges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2586)|
| 0:43:11| and just information out there in general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2591)|
| 0:43:14| I think that the city as well as the county at some point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2594)|
| 0:43:18| I know that we just did the budget increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2598)|
| 0:43:21| Maybe next year look at an additional increase, because at the end of the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2601)|
| 0:43:26| the people who are charged with protecting us and protecting our children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2606)|
| 0:43:29| and the people who are charged with teaching our children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2609)|
| 0:43:32| will have some of the lowest paid salaries starting out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2612)|
| 0:43:36| And so I do want to ask my colleagues as well as the mayor to challenge us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2616)|
| 0:43:40| to relook at that at the next budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2620)|
| 0:43:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2624)|
| 0:43:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2625)|
| 0:43:46| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2626)|
| 0:43:48| I'd just like to recognize Mr. Taylor here from the FOP and just ask a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2628)|
| 0:43:56| Mr. Taylor, if you could come to the podium and state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2636)|
| 0:44:05| Mark Taylor, 820 Hall of Fame Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2645)|
| 0:44:09| And I was just here observing the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2649)|
| 0:44:12| Well, do you mind if I – did you –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2652)|
| 0:44:14| No, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2654)|
| 0:44:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2655)|
| 0:44:16| Do you know – and Chief – good gracious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2656)|
| 0:44:20| The Chief may also know, doesn't the county also have similar issues with recruitment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2660)|
| 0:44:27| I mean, this is not an isolated KPD issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2667)|
| 0:44:31| It's not an isolated issue at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2671)|
| 0:44:35| You were asking –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2675)|
| 0:44:36| And about salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2676)|
| 0:44:37| You were asking a little earlier about salary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2677)|
| 0:44:39| and the county's starting salary is, I believe, within a couple hundred dollars of ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2679)|
| 0:44:46| And then some of the adjoining counties, which typically have been a little bit lagging behind us and stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2686)|
| 0:44:54| are very competitive with our salaries because I know folks that have looked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2694)|
| 0:44:59| For instance, I had a friend that had retired and was doing a security job at a Christian school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2699)|
| 0:45:06| and he left and went to a county starting at their entry rate at $39,800.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2706)|
| 0:45:14| So they've got a lot of flexibility with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2714)|
| 0:45:19| The difference is with the counties, they have a population to pull from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2719)|
| 0:45:25| at least for the patrol side or the uniformed officer side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2725)|
| 0:45:29| So where they're running a jail and they have 1,300 employees or whatever that number is for a county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2729)|
| 0:45:35| because they're providing the law enforcement side of services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2735)|
| 0:45:38| which is about 300 and some, roughly, patrol or that sort of uniformed officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2738)|
| 0:45:45| On their side, they have another 800 or so folks or whatever that number is that works the jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2745)|
| 0:45:50| So those people, they can train, certify them, and if they have shortages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2750)|
| 0:45:54| they have a lot quicker route into backfilling the patrol or the law enforcement side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2754)|
| 0:46:01| Of course, that will leave them short on the corrections side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2761)|
| 0:46:05| So there are some differences in the way they're structured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2765)|
| 0:46:08| It makes it a little more advantageous for them on some of those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2768)|
| 0:46:12| But we're not off the ballpark with the salary compared to the areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2772)|
| 0:46:17| because you guys keep up with that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2777)|
| 0:46:20| Their salary is very close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2780)|
| 0:46:21| Their starting salary is very close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2781)|
| 0:46:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2783)|
| 0:46:24| Thank you for your input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2784)|
| 0:46:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2786)|
| 0:46:27| I just want to add two things based on your discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2787)|
| 0:46:30| I would like to reassure you that I'm absolutely committed to looking into improvements to pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2790)|
| 0:46:36| and benefits for our first responders in this budget cycle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2796)|
| 0:46:40| and I think that is a critical part of what we do and needs to be compensated accordingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2800)|
| 0:46:47| I also just wanted to bring to your attention one reason I think Chattanooga might have had some success| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2807)|
| 0:46:52| is a study I read called the Behavioral Insights Team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2812)|
| 0:46:56| It helped Chattanooga with their whole process of recruiting to police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2816)|
| 0:47:01| and studied what were the most effective strategies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2821)|
| 0:47:05| And one of the three things they came up with is the sources of motivation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2825)|
| 0:47:11| So you might think that police join because they've always dreamed of fighting crime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2831)|
| 0:47:15| and driving fast cars or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2835)|
| 0:47:17| But it turns out, and they did a controlled study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2837)|
| 0:47:20| that the thing that was most effective in recruitment was talking about the pay and benefits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2840)|
| 0:47:26| and the commitment to public service and protecting the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2846)|
| 0:47:30| But the pay and benefits were more of a draw than some of the other things that might have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2850)|
| 0:47:35| The other thing that they talked about is how important the process is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2855)|
| 0:47:38| and I'm hoping this contract can help with that because someone might be real excited at the front end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2858)|
| 0:47:43| but then struggle to pass a test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2863)|
| 0:47:45| So do we coach them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2865)|
| 0:47:47| How long does it take?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2867)|
| 0:47:48| Does it take six weeks or 18 months from the time you're first recruited to the time you get that paid job?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2868)|
| 0:47:55| And then the last thing that they mentioned is just your next recruit may not be where you're looking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2875)|
| 0:48:01| We think about particular neighborhoods and colleges and military,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2881)|
| 0:48:05| but the one thing they found is that one rich place, at least in their test,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2885)|
| 0:48:10| was people have already expressed an interest in public service of some kind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2890)|
| 0:48:14| Maybe it's education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2894)|
| 0:48:15| Maybe it's in our public service department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2895)|
| 0:48:17| Maybe it's another thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2897)|
| 0:48:19| So I'm not sure if those would hold true in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2899)|
| 0:48:21| but this is why we would have this contract out to explore some of those things to be the most effective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2901)|
| 0:48:28| but not in lieu of the pay and benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2908)|
| 0:48:31| It can be both and.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2911)|
| 0:48:34| Any other questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2914)|
| 0:48:37| Okay, motion is made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2917)|
| 0:48:39| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2919)|
| 0:48:42| Oh, someone had signed up to speak to this issue just now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2922)|
| 0:48:48| so I'll let the council vote on whether you want to accept further public comment at this juncture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2928)|
| 0:48:55| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2935)|
| 0:48:57| Motion to allow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2937)|
| 0:48:58| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2938)|
| 0:48:59| Okay, motion made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2939)|
| 0:49:00| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2940)|
| 0:49:01| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2941)|
| 0:49:02| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2942)|
| 0:49:03| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2943)|
| 0:49:04| Please, you have up to five minutes to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2944)|
| 0:49:06| and please start by saying your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2946)|
| 0:49:09| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2949)|
| 0:49:10| My name is Umoja Abdul-Ahad, and I live at 116 South Elmwood in the East Knoxville area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2950)|
| 0:49:18| And I'll be brief, and I appreciate the vote for me to be able to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2958)|
| 0:49:23| How is a person selected?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2963)|
| 0:49:25| One time I thought there had to be a request for proposal of any amount over, like, 25K or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2965)|
| 0:49:33| Was there a request for proposal that went out for this $100,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2973)|
| 0:49:39| Yes, there was an RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2979)|
| 0:49:41| It did?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2981)|
| 0:49:44| It's my understanding that we're supposed to just listen to your comment and not, you know, but, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2984)|
| 0:49:49| According to the agenda, there's a whole RFP process for our normal procurement standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2989)|
| 0:49:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2993)|
| 0:49:54| Well, I mean, I didn't know that was a question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2994)|
| 0:49:56| because in the past there's been that amount of money just given out to various people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=2996)|
| 0:50:02| without there being a request for proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3002)|
| 0:50:05| I remember some time ago when on Thursday they would have activities in Market Square,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3005)|
| 0:50:12| and one of the major developers and one of the major promoters was able to just get $100,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3012)|
| 0:50:20| to do something on a regular basis without there being a process, like you said, you did go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3020)|
| 0:50:27| And I know that there were several African-American promoters in the community who said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3027)|
| 0:50:32| well, if I had $100,000, I could do the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3032)|
| 0:50:36| So I just wanted to be sure that this amount, that there was a process that was gone through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3036)|
| 0:50:43| that a person did get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3043)|
| 0:50:45| And I think, but I'm not sure about this young lady, but I think she did the cart, something about the cart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3045)|
| 0:50:56| You can go ahead and, you know, I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3056)|
| 0:51:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3060)|
| 0:51:01| All right, well, you've asked one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3061)|
| 0:51:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3063)|
| 0:51:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3064)|
| 0:51:06| There are no further people interested in speaking to this at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3066)|
| 0:51:10| so is there any further question or discussion from Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3070)|
| 0:51:13| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3073)|
| 0:51:15| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3075)|
| 0:51:16| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3076)|
| 0:51:17| Nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3077)|
| 0:51:18| Motion carries, 8-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3078)|
| 0:51:22| There's one nay, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3082)|
| 0:51:23| 8-1, and motion carries 8-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3083)|
| 0:51:26| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3086)|
| 0:51:30| Item 12A is an ordinance to amend Ordinance No. 283-2017| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3090)|
| 0:51:36| to extend the deadline for the University of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3096)|

| 0:51:43| So, Mayor, I'd like to move for emergency, for this to be around emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3103)|
| 0:51:49| Let's first have a motion and a second, and then we'll amend it to read it as an emergency motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3109)|

| 0:51:59| The amendment motion would be to have it read on emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3119)|
| 0:52:01| Okay, let's vote on the amendment, and the reason to read it on the emergency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3121)|
| 0:52:04| is because it was originally supposed to be on the December meeting that was canceled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3124)|
| 0:52:09| and so time constraints mean that we need, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3129)|
| 0:52:13| the Law Department has recommended that we read it and have it approved all in one night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3133)|

| 0:55:17| We have two people signed up for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3317)|
| 0:55:22| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3322)|
| 0:55:23| We'll start with Constance Evry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3323)|
| 0:55:26| Ms. Evry, if you could come to the podium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3326)|
| 0:55:27| please state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3327)|
| 0:55:29| and you have up to five minutes to address the council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3329)|
| 0:55:39| My name is Constance Evry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3339)|
| 0:55:40| 301 North Charlie Drive, Nassau, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3340)|
| 0:55:43| You know, I came here today to really speak in a welcome approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3343)|
| 0:55:47| Welcome new administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3347)|
| 0:55:48| Welcome to the game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3348)|
| 0:55:50| However, we have gotten here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3350)|
| 0:55:51| and already some very interesting things have come up on this agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3351)|
| 0:55:55| I want to go back to that $100,000 particularly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3355)|
| 0:55:58| I find it interesting that the stench of Dillon Williams is still very strong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3358)|
| 0:56:04| and the reality is that you all want to spend $100,000 on recruitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3364)|
| 0:56:09| when that $100,000 should really go into cleaning house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3369)|
| 0:56:13| So we have a cultural problem going on in our police department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3373)|
| 0:56:16| that has still not been addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3376)|
| 0:56:18| Addition to the fact, we have not forgotten about the body camera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3378)|
| 0:56:21| Why are we still not talking about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3381)|
| 0:56:23| You know, one of the critical pieces about the Dillon case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3383)|
| 0:56:26| was that we didn't have enough video footage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3386)|
| 0:56:28| We had witnesses, cell phones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3388)|
| 0:56:31| and the storylines of people who were there that told us what they knew| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3391)|
| 0:56:35| and how it went.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3395)|
| 0:56:36| But we never had hard evidence of any form to prove anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3396)|
| 0:56:40| Addition to the fact, I find it already disturbing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3400)|
| 0:56:43| because I'm going to hold you accountable, India.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3403)|
| 0:56:46| You told the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3406)|
| 0:56:47| I want to improve public relationships between the police department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3407)|
| 0:56:51| and the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3411)|
| 0:56:53| Under Evo Thomas' watch, we have had numerous officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3413)|
| 0:56:57| I want to call out Bible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3417)|
| 0:56:58| because he was the one that was having sex with his co-worker's own wife,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3418)|
| 0:57:01| and that came out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3421)|
| 0:57:02| You know, these are the things we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3422)|
| 0:57:04| And yet, you all think it's appropriate to spend $100,000 in recruitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3424)|
| 0:57:10| I've got a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3430)|
| 0:57:11| Those promotional cards that they've been riding around in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3431)|
| 0:57:13| how much money was that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3433)|
| 0:57:14| You know, I just keep looking at how we are wasting money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3434)|
| 0:57:17| Still, continue to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3437)|
| 0:57:19| And then they talked about the payroll factors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3439)|
| 0:57:21| which some of the counselors brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3441)|
| 0:57:23| We have teachers who don't even make nowhere near $40,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3443)|
| 0:57:28| who spend their own money because they need supplies in the classroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3448)|
| 0:57:32| because we're not providing that with our tax dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3452)|
| 0:57:34| And these are the things that this council has continued to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3454)|
| 0:57:38| and continued to show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3458)|
| 0:57:39| So my question is, what's different?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3459)|
| 0:57:42| And the answer is nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3462)|
| 0:57:43| Ninety-two percent of the police forces is white male.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3463)|
| 0:57:47| How diversified does that make us look compared to surrounding counties?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3467)|
| 0:57:50| I'm sure the numbers are not really that different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3470)|
| 0:57:52| because we know across the nation police forces are predominantly white male.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3472)|
| 0:57:56| So the reality is we are still not addressing the realities of the situation we are facing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3476)|
| 0:58:01| That's still a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3481)|
| 0:58:03| And I'm still going to say what I said from day one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3483)|
| 0:58:05| Eva Thompson should have been removed from her position, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3485)|
| 0:58:09| And that didn't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3489)|
| 0:58:10| So that tells me these relationships that you adamantly said you were going to do something about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3490)|
| 0:58:15| are not going to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3495)|
| 0:58:16| It's going to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3496)|
| 0:58:17| I would like to know what children are you talking to about being a police officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3497)|
| 0:58:21| because the children I talk to have zero interest in being a police officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3501)|
| 0:58:25| They want to take political office so they can do something about the police officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3505)|
| 0:58:28| the kids that I talk to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3508)|
| 0:58:30| In addition to the fact I still have a disturbance of many other places we still are facing gentrification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3510)|
| 0:58:36| I just sat here recently and watched the Clayton family approve a million-dollar museum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3516)|
| 0:58:40| dropping into our community that we don't want there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3520)|
| 0:58:42| I mean, the list continues to be long and uncounted for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3522)|
| 0:58:46| So I guess my thing for the new administration, welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3526)|
| 0:58:49| The problems are still quite prevalent and still sitting here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3529)|
| 0:58:52| And the reality is that don't put the pressure on Amelia Parker to be the only representation of voice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3532)|
| 0:58:58| You still need to come talk to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3538)|
| 0:58:59| You still need to sit down and meet with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3539)|
| 0:59:01| Amelia's not going to have every single answer on behalf of the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3541)|
| 0:59:04| Yes, she's a people candidate, but she maintains that relationship and communication with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3544)|
| 0:59:08| Some of you all should probably find out what she's doing that you all have not been doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3548)|
| 0:59:12| because if you don't continue to address these problems, we will continue to come here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3552)|
| 0:59:16| We have Winters Capitol Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3556)|
| 0:59:18| I got the luxury because of the outstanding state representative, Rick Staples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3558)|
| 0:59:22| He brought me to the caucus floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3562)|
| 0:59:24| Let me tell you how empowering that was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3564)|
| 0:59:26| People have died for us to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3566)|
| 0:59:29| My ancestors bled and died for even the African-American representation we have sitting here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3569)|
| 0:59:34| So that was a very empowering moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3574)|
| 0:59:36| And it further made me realize the duty we have as activists and the advocates and voices of our people, we must continue that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3576)|
| 0:59:43| The reality is that we are willing to move forward with legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3583)|
| 0:59:46| The reality is that we're willing to move forward with other forms of legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3586)|
| 0:59:49| And also keep in mind, elections are still going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3589)|

| 1:00:01| So don't get comfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3601)|
| 1:00:02| Never get comfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3602)|
| 1:00:04| And the reality is that while you're talking about pay, KPD makes more money than all of y'all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3604)|
| 1:00:08| $24,000 is the set payroll for you all if you want to talk about pay improvement as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3608)|
| 1:00:12| So how about you give yourself a raise before you give them another raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3612)|
| 1:00:15| So, again, welcome, new council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3615)|

| 1:00:29| Jeremy Bergman, 2722 West Emory in Powell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3629)|
| 1:00:33| Good evening, honorable representatives, and a special greeting to you, newly appointed Mayor Kincannon and other city council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3633)|
| 1:00:40| Thank you all for your desire to serve our community and your beginning labors to uphold justice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3640)|
| 1:00:45| I consider it a privilege to address you this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3645)|
| 1:00:48| Like I said, my name is Jeremy Bergman, and I am coming before you today with the blessing of my church, Basswood Church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3648)|
| 1:00:53| on behalf of the pre-born children who are murdered in our city every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3653)|
| 1:00:57| My request before you this evening is simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3657)|
| 1:01:00| Make Knoxville a sanctuary city for the pre-born.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3660)|
| 1:01:03| Mayor Kincannon, I was pleased to hear you say in your acceptance speech that your vision for Knoxville is to be the city that always puts people first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3663)|
| 1:01:11| However, I submit to you that as long as you allow the innocent shedding of blood within our city, your vision will always be outside your reach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3671)|
| 1:01:19| My God, the owner and creator of all that is visible and invisible, says in his law that you shall not murder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3679)|
| 1:01:26| Yet every day in our city we have mothers and doctors who are premeditating the killing of one human being by another, which is the very definition of murder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3686)|
| 1:01:35| As evidenced by a host of research, these human beings, at the moment of conception, will begin a rapid rate to divide and form cells.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3695)|
| 1:01:44| By week two, usually before the mother is aware she is pregnant, skin is already being formed, as well as the central and peripheral nervous systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3704)|
| 1:01:54| Four weeks after conception, the baby's brain and spinal cord will be developed, as well as the heart and other organs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3714)|
| 1:02:01| Week five, the baby's head is being shaped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3721)|
| 1:02:04| Week six, the nose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3724)|
| 1:02:05| Week seven, toes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3725)|
| 1:02:07| Week eight, the baby's elbows bend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3727)|
| 1:02:10| Week nine, the genitals develop, face is broad, eyes are widely separated, and buds for teeth appear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3730)|
| 1:02:17| Week ten, the fingernails form, and the intestines are in the abdomen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3737)|
| 1:02:21| This baby is a human, capable of feeling pain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3741)|
| 1:02:25| There's no denying that, and yet entirely unable to protect itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3745)|
| 1:02:30| And all Tennessee law requires is the woman's consent and a licensed physician to perform the slaughter of an innocent child within the mother's womb| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3750)|
| 1:02:38| and call it legal progress and freedom for women.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3758)|
| 1:02:43| This is heartbreaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3763)|
| 1:02:45| These are image bearers of God, and we murder approximately 3,000 of them a day in America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3765)|
| 1:02:51| I'm asking that one of you, our representatives, lead in this effort to bring to the floor an official discussion on the matter of ending abortion in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3771)|
| 1:03:00| Would you join other cities across America who are declaring their cities to be sanctuary cities for the preborn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3780)|
| 1:03:07| and declaring to the nation that we truly are a city who does put all people first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3787)|
| 1:03:13| I call on you to uphold your oath to serve and protect all those within our city limits, born and preborn alike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3793)|
| 1:03:21| I call on you to repent from turning a blind eye to the daily murder that goes unpunished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3801)|
| 1:03:26| I call on you to take a stand for justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3806)|
| 1:03:30| I call on you to repent and turn from your sins and bow in humble submission to our Maker and Savior, Jesus Christ, who gave you the power you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3810)|
| 1:03:40| I call for you to delight in Him and make Knoxville a safe place for all, especially the most vulnerable of all, preborn children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3820)|
| 1:03:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3828)|
| 1:03:50| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3830)|
| 1:03:51| Council members, that concludes public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3831)|
| 1:03:53| This meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200114?start=3833)|
