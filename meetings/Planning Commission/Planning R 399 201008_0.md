| 0:13:57| I don't understand item 18, the requesting five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=837)|
| 0:14:04| The staff is recommending two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=844)|
| 0:14:07| I don't understand how it can be on consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=847)|
| 0:14:12| Are you asking Ms. Korbelik to remove item 18 from consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=852)|
| 0:14:19| I suppose so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=859)|

| 0:14:23| I just don't understand how it can get on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=863)|
| 0:14:26| If I may, I'm the planner who reviewed that case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=866)|
| 0:14:29| And so we were contacted, the applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=869)|
| 0:14:31| and notified him that it would be on the consent list and that he would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=871)|
| 0:14:34| be able to pull it off of consent if you wish to have the item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=874)|
| 0:14:38| removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=878)|
| 0:14:39| And so that's what I was wondering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=879)|
| 0:14:40| I don't know if he's aware of that fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=880)|
| 0:14:42| I don't know if he's aware of that fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=882)|

| 0:14:50| So if you'd like to weigh in on whether you'd like to remove that or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=890)|
| 0:14:53| not, we recommend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=893)|

| 0:14:57| Okay. That's what I was wondering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=897)|

| 0:18:11| Would you like opposition to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1091)|

| 0:18:14| I don't think there is any opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1094)|
| 0:18:16| We've dealt with that already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1096)|
| 0:18:17| Thank you for hearing me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1097)|

| 0:18:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1104)|
| 0:18:25| I'll move forward then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1105)|
| 0:18:27| My name is Wayne Klein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1107)|
| 0:18:28| I'm with the firm of Hodges daddy and Carson at six 17 main street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1108)|
| 0:18:31| Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1111)|
| 0:18:32| My client is Metro truck and trailer repair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1112)|
| 0:18:35| We're here on the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1115)|
| 0:18:37| That's before you and commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1117)|
| 0:18:39| We have a real conundrum with this business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1119)|
| 0:18:41| which is located in a very rural area of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1121)|
| 0:18:45| And one Oh four, two, six Rutledge Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1125)|
| 0:18:47| Close to the County line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1127)|
| 0:18:49| And the reason why we're here is because, as Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1129)|
| 0:18:52| Klein Metro trailer and truck repair has been located on this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1132)|
| 0:18:56| for a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1136)|
| 0:19:01| And the manner in which the business operates is to bring in damage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1141)|
| 0:19:04| trailers and tractor trailers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1144)|
| 0:19:06| And either repair them for their customers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1146)|
| 0:19:08| Or make a determination that the trailers or semis are totaled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1148)|
| 0:19:13| That is the damage. The units are irreparable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1153)|
| 0:19:15| Once the determination is made, the units are either repaired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1155)|
| 0:19:18| Or sent to a salvage yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1158)|
| 0:19:19| And the salvage yard is used for storage value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1159)|
| 0:19:22| And sent to salvage yards for scraps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1162)|
| 0:19:30| Before they are sent off Metro trailer will remove parts that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1170)|
| 0:19:33| reusable and recyclable and sell or recycle these parts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1173)|
| 0:19:37| For the repair of other trailers or semis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1177)|
| 0:19:39| Or even sell them to other commercial ventures who need those parts to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1179)|
| 0:19:42| repair trailers or semis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1182)|
| 0:19:44| These customers primarily come from east Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1184)|
| 0:19:46| which is where most of the trailer and tractor repair business is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1186)|
| 0:19:49| located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1189)|
| 0:19:50| The recyclable parts have become more valuable recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1190)|
| 0:19:53| And that's why the aerial photos of the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1193)|
| 0:19:55| If you see in your packets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1195)|
| 0:20:02| Show that recently appears the business is being run as a salvage yard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1202)|
| 0:20:05| and not a tractor and trailer repair business, but that is not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1205)|
| 0:20:08| The primary business of Metro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1208)|
| 0:20:10| Is and always has been tractor and trailer repair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1210)|
| 0:20:13| Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1213)|
| 0:20:14| Helton has since worked with us and even signed the petition that you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1214)|
| 0:20:18| in front of you in favor of our application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1218)|
| 0:20:24| Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1224)|
| 0:20:25| Devault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1225)|

| 0:20:27| So we have not talked to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1227)|
| 0:20:29| But I did send you all of the petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1229)|
| 0:20:31| Signed petitions in your packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1231)|
| 0:20:35| And.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1235)|
| 0:20:36| Another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1236)|
| 0:20:43| A member of county codes came to Metro trailers and cited them and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1243)|
| 0:20:48| if you don't apply for industrial zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1248)|
| 0:20:51| then we're going to shut you down and you have to apply by Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1251)|
| 0:20:54| Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1254)|
| 0:20:55| I was hired and I immediately filed for the zoning and sector plan changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1255)|
| 0:20:59| mandated by the codes officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1259)|
| 0:21:01| And the zoning ordinance is in violation of any ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1261)|
| 0:21:05| But after investigating and evaluating the business operation and the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1265)|
| 0:21:08| ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1268)|
| 0:21:11| I don't believe Metro trailer repair is in violation of any ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1271)|
| 0:21:14| The staff recommendation is to deny the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1274)|
| 0:21:19| Not because it doesn't meet the performance standards of the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1279)|

| 0:21:36| There is no definition of salvage yard in the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1296)|
| 0:21:39| But an auto wrecking yard is regulated under section 4.4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1299)|

| 0:23:31| Now, as I mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1411)|
| 0:23:32| there is an ordinance in violation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1412)|
| 0:23:35| which says one of the operations after this business was already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1415)|
| 0:23:38| operating mandate the removal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1418)|
| 0:23:40| And that's not what this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1420)|
| 0:23:41| And this zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1421)|
| 0:23:42| Is all about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1422)|
| 0:23:43| That's not what this commission is all about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1423)|
| 0:23:45| And so what we're asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1425)|
| 0:23:46| Is for you, Mr. Klein, your, your time is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1426)|
| 0:23:49| Can you wrap it up? And.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1429)|
| 0:23:50| I can, I can wrap it up in 30 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1430)|
| 0:23:52| zone because it's not impact against the neighborhood nor will it in its operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1432)|
| 0:23:59| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1439)|
| 0:24:00| Thank you, Mr. Klein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1440)|
| 0:24:06| Commissioner Graf, I noticed your hand is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1446)|
| 0:24:11| I kind of jumped the gun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1451)|
| 0:24:12| I want to speak, but you need to hear from any others first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1452)|
| 0:24:19| I'm not seeing, Commissioner, anybody signed up to speak on this particular item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1459)|
| 0:24:28| Then I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1468)|
| 0:24:29| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1469)|
| 0:24:31| Mr. Klein brought up the point that maybe they're in compliance already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1471)|
| 0:24:40| So if we were to deny this, they're still in business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1480)|
| 0:24:46| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1486)|
| 0:24:50| Yeah, or is Mr. Klein correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1490)|
| 0:24:54| I guess what I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1494)|
| 0:24:57| That would be a question for Codes, Knox County Codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1497)|
| 0:25:02| Ms. Brooks, is there anybody from Knox County Codes on this meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1502)|
| 0:25:07| Yes, there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1507)|
| 0:25:08| I believe Steve Elliott might be available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1508)|
| 0:25:13| Mr. Elliott, could you respond to Mr. Graf's comments, please,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1513)|
| 0:25:18| and Mr. Klein's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1518)|
| 0:25:21| Yes, Steve Elliott, 205 West Baxter 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1521)|
| 0:25:26| We would respectfully disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1526)|
| 0:25:27| We don't think this salvage yard is allowed in the ag zoning or even in the CA zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1527)|
| 0:25:33| We think the auto salvage yard is only allowed in the industrial zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1533)|
| 0:25:37| Well, would Mr. Klein, can we have him back for a minute and have a little discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1537)|
| 0:25:46| Because I think that's a big issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1546)|
| 0:25:51| If it's already allowed, then if we turn it down, it just continues to operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1551)|
| 0:26:02| It just continues to operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1562)|
| 0:26:10| So could we have Mr. Klein come back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1570)|
| 0:26:14| I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1574)|
| 0:26:15| Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1575)|
| 0:26:16| Yes, Mr. Klein's connected, Commissioner Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1576)|
| 0:26:18| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1578)|
| 0:26:22| Commissioner, my point is that it has been operating this way for several years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1582)|
| 0:26:27| and up until recently, when the parts for these tractors became more valuable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1587)|
| 0:26:34| it looks like it's a salvage yard, but it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1594)|
| 0:26:36| It's a trailer and semi-repair shop, which is allowable in the zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1596)|
| 0:26:45| And if you're going to say, well, you can't take the parts off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1605)|
| 0:26:48| because you become a salvage yard, then we are forced to apply for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1608)|
| 0:26:55| the heavy industrial zoning because there is no other place for a salvage yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1615)|
| 0:27:06| The business is willing to make sure that it doesn't keep salvage parts on the yard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1626)|
| 0:27:14| that it maintains itself as a trailer and tractor repair in the zone that it's already in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1634)|
| 0:27:24| We're willing to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1644)|
| 0:27:25| But CODES is saying, oh, you can't do it because you're a salvage yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1645)|
| 0:27:30| And it's the same operation that's been there for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1650)|
| 0:27:37| Thank you, Mr. Klein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1657)|
| 0:27:38| Commissioner Korbelik.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1658)|
| 0:27:42| I just wanted to follow up on Commissioner Graf's observation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1662)|
| 0:27:46| that the property actually is two zones, and I would be surprised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1666)|
| 0:27:51| I would again ask, are you quite sure that the salvage function| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1671)|
| 0:27:58| or the commercial function is allowed in the egg zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1678)|
| 0:28:02| If we were to deny this, it's my feeling that it would not be allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1682)|
| 0:28:07| in the egg zone unless it has the industrial zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1687)|
| 0:28:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1691)|
| 0:28:12| Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1692)|
| 0:28:13| Yeah, thank you, Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1693)|
| 0:28:16| I've got a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1696)|
| 0:28:18| One, I heard Mr. Klein say earlier that it was rezoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1698)|
| 0:28:22| unbeknownst to the owner, some years back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1702)|
| 0:28:26| Remind me, can you restate when that was and what was the zone before that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1706)|
| 0:28:38| The zone was in the egg zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1718)|
| 0:28:40| The zone, Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1720)|
| 0:28:47| The rezoning was 1997, and I don't know what the zone was before that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1727)|
| 0:28:52| I'm Michelle Porch, I'm the planner who worked on this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1732)|
| 0:28:56| and it was rezoned to agriculture in 1997.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1736)|
| 0:28:59| So it's not the CA zoning that's new, it's the egg zoning that's new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1739)|
| 0:29:04| But since the building was operating on the CA portion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1744)|
| 0:29:09| the motor vehicle repair portion was operating on the CA portion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1749)|
| 0:29:13| and that's why it was compliant at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1753)|
| 0:29:16| So is it still compliant on the CA portion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1756)|
| 0:29:20| It depends on the classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1760)|
| 0:29:22| If it's classified as a motor vehicle repair shop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1762)|
| 0:29:26| then yes, that is allowed in the CA zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1766)|
| 0:29:29| If it's a salvage yard, then no, it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1769)|
| 0:29:31| It really kind of comes down to how you classify the use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1771)|
| 0:29:37| Is it also in conformance on ag if it's classified as an auto repair place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1777)|
| 0:29:46| No, that would have to be contained within the CA zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1786)|
| 0:29:49| or they'd have to zone the egg portion to CA if they wanted to use the whole lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1789)|
| 0:29:53| Okay, so who gets to determine really what is classified as,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1793)|
| 0:30:03| where's that line drawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1803)|
| 0:30:07| That would be a codes administration issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1807)|
| 0:30:11| and I think if there's any disagreement with codes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1811)|
| 0:30:15| then I think it would be a BZA issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1815)|
| 0:30:18| Jim Snowden has his hand up, and I'll recognize Jim Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1818)|
| 0:30:23| Yes, Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1823)|
| 0:30:26| We do believe the front part is a trailer repair as a repair shop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1826)|
| 0:30:30| and it has been in business there for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1830)|
| 0:30:32| So we think that parcel in the CA is compliant with the zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1832)|
| 0:30:38| It's the part that's in the ag that we feel like needs to be rezoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1838)|
| 0:30:42| or the trailer's removed from that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1842)|
| 0:30:46| They don't get this rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1846)|
| 0:30:48| So Mr. Snowden, if it was rezoned to CA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1848)|
| 0:30:52| would you deem it to be compliant then in that area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1852)|
| 0:30:58| No, the salvage yard would not be compatible in the ag zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1858)|
| 0:31:03| or the CA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1863)|
| 0:31:04| It would only be compatible in the industrial zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1864)|
| 0:31:07| When I'm getting at those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1867)|
| 0:31:10| explain to me where the determination is between auto repair and the salvage yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1870)|
| 0:31:18| Well, I think when our inspectors visited the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1878)|
| 0:31:20| they seen, as you can see from the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1880)|
| 0:31:24| lots of trailers in multiple stages of being disassembled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1884)|
| 0:31:29| So we deem that to be a salvage yard when you're taking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1889)|
| 0:31:32| disassembling, taking them out, selling part by part like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1892)|
| 0:31:40| Commissioner A. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1900)|
| 0:31:43| Well, and I want to follow up on Commissioner Roth's questioning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1903)|
| 0:31:45| You know, there, and Jim, I guess, kind of helped me out a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1905)|
| 0:31:51| If a trailer is sitting on the back lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1911)|
| 0:31:53| while it's either in some sort of stage of either being repaired| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1913)|
| 0:31:57| or parts used to repair another trailer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1917)|
| 0:32:01| how is that not part of the operations of what's happening on the front part of the lot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1921)|
| 0:32:07| And I guess, you know, is there a time limit that something can be on the lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1927)|
| 0:32:11| in that stage that it would not be considered a salvage yard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1931)|
| 0:32:15| but if it exceeds that time frame that it's still there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1935)|
| 0:32:18| that it would be considered a salvage lot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1938)|
| 0:32:28| Hey, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1948)|
| 0:32:29| Yeah, I'm going to let Tammy Harvey, she is our zoning officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1949)|
| 0:32:34| Her folks were the ones that actually had eyes on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1954)|
| 0:32:37| So I'm going to let her kind of speak to what she saw| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1957)|
| 0:32:39| and to your question because she has firsthand knowledge of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1959)|
| 0:32:43| Okay, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1963)|
| 0:32:43| Would you ask the question again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1963)|
| 0:32:46| Yeah, the question I have is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1966)|
| 0:32:47| if a trailer is sitting in the back part of the lot in the agricultural zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1967)|
| 0:32:51| but the front part of the lot, which is in the CA, is in compliance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1971)|
| 0:32:54| and they're working on a trailer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1974)|
| 0:32:56| but it's being parked out back while it's either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1976)|
| 0:32:58| parts are being taken off of that to repair another trailer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1978)|
| 0:33:03| I understand there may be a time limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1983)|
| 0:33:05| Let's say it's 30 days that that trailer is sitting on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1985)|
| 0:33:08| That would then be considered a salvage yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1988)|
| 0:33:11| But if it's sitting there and it's gone in less than that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1991)|
| 0:33:13| is that still considered a salvage yard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1993)|
| 0:33:16| if parts are being used to repair something else that's happening in the business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=1996)|
| 0:33:21| Where's the determination?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2001)|
| 0:33:23| Yeah, if you've ever been out to the site, it truly is all salvage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2003)|
| 0:33:28| The few times we've been there, nobody's been working on trailers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2008)|
| 0:33:33| They're junk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2013)|
| 0:33:35| They're just metal on top of metal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2015)|
| 0:33:41| All right, Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2021)|
| 0:33:51| Thank you, Chair Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2031)|
| 0:33:53| I'm going to support staff on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2033)|
| 0:33:56| Primarily, one, Mr. Kline, it shouldn't matter to Mr. Kline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2036)|
| 0:34:00| because he believes that he's compliant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2040)|
| 0:34:02| So I believe that changing the sector and the zoning is inappropriate in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2042)|
| 0:34:09| And looking at those historic aerials, to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2049)|
| 0:34:13| it's obvious that there was a change in business operation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2053)|
| 0:34:19| that we saw at the agenda review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2059)|
| 0:34:22| So that's my take on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2062)|
| 0:34:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2065)|
| 0:34:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2066)|
| 0:34:27| Chair recognizes Commissioner Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2067)|
| 0:34:30| Um, let's see here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2070)|
| 0:34:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2072)|
| 0:34:33| Yeah, I'm going to the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2073)|
| 0:34:36| Uh, I can't come up with a justification to change the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2076)|
| 0:34:40| I can't come up with any recent changes, utilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2080)|
| 0:34:45| anything in the area that's changed that would justify a sector plan change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2085)|
| 0:34:50| And for that reason, I kind of, I can't support this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2090)|
| 0:34:56| but I would support staff as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2096)|
| 0:34:58| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2098)|
| 0:35:00| Chair recognizes Commissioner Buston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2100)|
| 0:35:06| Commissioner Buston, would you unmute your?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2106)|
| 0:35:11| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2111)|
| 0:35:11| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2111)|
| 0:35:13| Thank you, Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2113)|
| 0:35:15| Mr. Kline, I have a quick question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2115)|
| 0:35:19| Does your clients have people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2119)|
| 0:35:24| buyers that come in and buy this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2124)|
| 0:35:26| these parts from any, you know, from this company?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2126)|
| 0:35:30| Do you know of any, any sort of business that's going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2130)|
| 0:35:34| where they're selling those, those salvage parts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2134)|
| 0:35:45| Mr. Kline, you're muted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2145)|
| 0:35:46| Okay, can you hear me now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2146)|
| 0:35:48| Yes, we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2148)|
| 0:35:49| Yes, there is a commercial venture going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2149)|
| 0:35:54| Contrary to what Mr. Hill said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2154)|
| 0:35:56| there's constantly semis being repaired,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2156)|
| 0:36:01| but there are people that either come or by mail purchase parts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2161)|
| 0:36:08| from, I guess, damaged or irreparable trailers and tractor trailers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2168)|
| 0:36:18| Okay, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2178)|
| 0:36:21| I'd just like to say too, I think that this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2181)|
| 0:36:23| I could not support this change in the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2183)|
| 0:36:28| I just don't see any justification for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2188)|
| 0:36:35| That's, it's just, it's just too, too severe sounding for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2195)|
| 0:36:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2200)|
| 0:36:41| Thank you, Commissioner Buston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2201)|
| 0:36:43| Chair recognizes Commissioner Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2203)|
| 0:36:46| Yes, back to denying this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2206)|
| 0:36:51| If we deny it, it stays as is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2211)|
| 0:36:56| And I guess what is the next step then for the owner of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2216)|
| 0:37:05| to get this changed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2225)|
| 0:37:08| If Mr. Kline is correct, where do they go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2228)|
| 0:37:14| Do they go to court to get it settled?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2234)|
| 0:37:17| If our engineering department or codes department says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2237)|
| 0:37:26| that this is not, that this is a salvage yard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2246)|
| 0:37:30| Mr. Kline says it's not, how does that get resolved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2250)|
| 0:37:36| Commissioner Graf, I think we would end up going to the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2256)|
| 0:37:41| If it gets denied today, we would issue a citation to the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2261)|
| 0:37:46| And if they disputed our interpretation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2266)|
| 0:37:50| then we would end up going to the Board of Zoning Appeals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2270)|
| 0:37:53| with them to let them make the final say if it's salvage yard or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2273)|
| 0:37:59| All right, well, I think that's the direction to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2279)|
| 0:38:03| Thank you, Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2283)|
| 0:38:04| Chair recognizes Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2284)|
| 0:38:07| Thank you, Chair Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2287)|
| 0:38:09| I would like to then go ahead and make a motion to deny| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2289)|
| 0:38:12| the general commercial designation since it does not meet the criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2292)|
| 0:38:15| for the sector plan per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2295)|
| 0:38:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2299)|
| 0:38:19| Is there a second to that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2299)|

| 0:42:58| or the commissioners if they have any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2578)|

| 0:47:49| I did try to email in the essence of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2869)|
| 0:47:53| some of the points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2873)|
| 0:47:55| Was the commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2875)|
| 0:47:56| did the commissioners get the email?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2876)|
| 0:48:01| Yes, I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2881)|
| 0:48:03| I'd be happy to reread it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2883)|
| 0:48:05| if we think that's necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2885)|
| 0:48:07| If the commissioner received the email,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2887)|
| 0:48:15| then I think you're free to continue on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2895)|
| 0:48:18| Or if you want to read it, that's fine too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2898)|
| 0:48:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2900)|
| 0:48:20| Your choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2900)|
| 0:48:22| I want to take the opportunity to thank the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2902)|
| 0:48:25| for taking the time to review our case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2905)|
| 0:48:27| and request for rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2907)|
| 0:48:29| Our emulsion plant at 405 West Oldham Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2909)|
| 0:48:32| has been in operation for over 50 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2912)|
| 0:48:35| Formerly operating under Vulcan Materials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2915)|
| 0:48:38| and since 2005,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2918)|
| 0:48:40| and still currently operating under Hudson Emulsion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2920)|
| 0:48:42| LLC, DBA, Hudson Materials Company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2922)|
| 0:48:45| Hudson Materials Company has received written approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2925)|
| 0:48:48| from the landowner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2928)|
| 0:48:49| which is Wagoner Properties, LLC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2929)|
| 0:48:52| to pursue this application for rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2932)|
| 0:48:54| I'd be happy to provide the commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2934)|
| 0:48:57| with that written permission as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2937)|
| 0:49:01| Hudson Materials has requested to be rezoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2941)|
| 0:49:03| from industrial mixed use to heavy industrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2943)|
| 0:49:06| to make necessary upgrades to our facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2946)|
| 0:49:09| These upgrades will enhance and improve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2949)|
| 0:49:11| our safety protocols, environmental compliance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2951)|
| 0:49:15| the facade and appearance of our facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2955)|
| 0:49:19| and be more efficient regarding energy usage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2959)|
| 0:49:22| With zoning of heavy industrial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2962)|
| 0:49:24| we will be able to upgrade our assets and equipment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2964)|
| 0:49:27| in its current footprint to provide our products| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2967)|
| 0:49:30| to many of the local municipalities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2970)|
| 0:49:32| including, but not limited to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2972)|
| 0:49:34| Knox County Public Works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2974)|
| 0:49:36| the City of Knoxville Public Works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2976)|
| 0:49:38| the Knoxville Utility Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2978)|
| 0:49:41| and the Tennessee Department of Transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2981)|
| 0:49:44| I've highlighted a few of the important topics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2984)|
| 0:49:46| regarding our rezoning application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2986)|
| 0:49:48| and how it applies to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2988)|
| 0:49:51| The first thing is the entrance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2991)|
| 0:49:52| to our facility and traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2992)|
| 0:49:56| With this rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2996)|
| 0:49:57| we do not anticipate anything changing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=2997)|
| 0:50:00| in regards to the amount of traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3000)|
| 0:50:03| and how we have operated in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3003)|
| 0:50:06| Our entrance to our facility there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3006)|
| 0:50:08| is such that there are only a few houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3008)|
| 0:50:11| four to be exact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3011)|
| 0:50:13| that we pass on West Oldham Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3013)|
| 0:50:15| to enter our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3015)|
| 0:50:18| The second point is asset replacement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3018)|
| 0:50:21| Again, we want to reiterate that our focus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3021)|
| 0:50:23| is to remove existing out-of-service tanks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3023)|
| 0:50:27| and replace them with new, similar-sized tanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3027)|
| 0:50:33| Our property is landlocked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3033)|
| 0:50:35| The existing property is, like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3035)|
| 0:50:38| landlocked and prohibits us from further expansion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3038)|
| 0:50:42| outside of our current footprint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3042)|
| 0:50:44| So really, we're just trying to remove| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3044)|
| 0:50:46| and replace old tanks with new ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3046)|
| 0:50:51| I'd also like to point out that we have a neighbor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3051)|
| 0:50:54| that is zoned for heavy industrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3054)|
| 0:50:56| on the northwest side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3056)|
| 0:50:57| which I think we can see on that map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3057)|
| 0:51:01| This property backs up directly to about 14 houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3061)|
| 0:51:07| We, on the other hand, are set back a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3067)|
| 0:51:11| from any direct border with residential properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3071)|
| 0:51:17| We have direct borders with two residential properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3077)|
| 0:51:21| on the far end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3081)|
| 0:51:22| and the rest are all on the other side of Davana Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3082)|
| 0:51:25| and there's about four houses there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3085)|
| 0:51:29| This rezoning would also help streamline upgrades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3089)|
| 0:51:32| We would be able to make our upgrades| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3092)|
| 0:51:36| without having to apply for variances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3096)|
| 0:51:38| in the Board of Zoning Appeals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3098)|
| 0:51:40| for every time we want to make a change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3100)|
| 0:51:42| or upgrade a tank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3102)|
| 0:51:45| And again, I'd like to also point out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3105)|
| 0:51:46| that all of our upgrades will be in accordance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3106)|
| 0:51:49| with the City of Knoxville Building and Permitting Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3109)|
| 0:51:53| We will have engineered drawings available soon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3113)|
| 0:51:56| and we would be happy to submit those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3116)|
| 0:51:58| to the commissioners as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3118)|
| 0:52:02| Again, we appreciate your time and consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3122)|
| 0:52:04| of our application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3124)|
| 0:52:05| We're hopeful that you will grant us the proper permissions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3125)|
| 0:52:08| to make these necessary upgrades| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3128)|
| 0:52:10| to our facility and equipment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3130)|
| 0:52:12| and we look forward to continuing to operate our business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3132)|
| 0:52:15| at our current property within the city limits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3135)|
| 0:52:18| and hope to develop a mutually beneficial relationship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3138)|
| 0:52:21| for everyone involved for the years to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3141)|
| 0:52:23| So I thank the commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3143)|
| 0:52:25| and everyone involved with the planning committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3145)|
| 0:52:29| helping us with our application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3149)|
| 0:52:31| and we really appreciate you taking the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3151)|
| 0:52:34| to hear our story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3154)|
| 0:52:35| Thank you, Mr. Giles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3155)|
| 0:52:38| Is there any representative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3158)|
| 0:52:39| from the City Codes Enforcement Office available?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3159)|
| 0:52:47| Peter Ahrens is available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3167)|
| 0:52:48| Yes, I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3168)|
| 0:52:52| It looks like they're just replacing the existing facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3172)|
| 0:52:56| and not really expanding it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3176)|
| 0:52:59| not seeing where it's changing the nature of the business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3179)|
| 0:53:02| that's currently there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3182)|
| 0:53:04| Could you explain, please,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3184)|
| 0:53:06| your department's issues with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3186)|
| 0:53:09| and are you okay with them expanding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3189)|
| 0:53:15| So under the new IMU zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3195)|
| 0:53:18| it would be a nonconformity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3198)|
| 0:53:20| and there would be complications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3200)|
| 0:53:25| with expanding the nonconformity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3205)|
| 0:53:28| They're actually increasing the number of tanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3208)|
| 0:53:33| From what I understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3213)|
| 0:53:33| there are a smaller capacity, but a greater number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3213)|
| 0:53:36| and so we looked at the greater number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3216)|
| 0:53:38| as expanding a nonconformity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3218)|
| 0:53:41| We've had conversations with the applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3221)|
| 0:53:44| and we understand that under the old I-2 district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3224)|
| 0:53:49| I believe, I'd have to double-check,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3229)|
| 0:53:51| but I believe it was compliant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3231)|
| 0:53:54| and it was during the rezoning of January of 2020| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3234)|
| 0:54:00| that they became noncompliant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3240)|
| 0:54:03| and I'm going to do my best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3243)|
| 0:54:05| to try and look up the old zoning codes to verify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3245)|
| 0:54:20| Does that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3260)|
| 0:54:23| Yes, yes, it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3263)|
| 0:54:24| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3264)|
| 0:54:25| Thank you, Mr. Ahrens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3265)|
| 0:54:29| Chair recognizes Commissioner Uten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3269)|
| 0:54:32| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3272)|
| 0:54:32| My question, Pat, was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3272)|
| 0:54:35| Commissioner Phillips,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3275)|
| 0:54:36| was exactly yours about what is tripping this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3276)|
| 0:54:40| to go to a zone change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3280)|
| 0:54:43| You know, obviously, we've all seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3283)|
| 0:54:49| how blighted old industrial sites can be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3289)|
| 0:54:52| and if somebody's willing to put money in industrial sites| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3292)|
| 0:54:55| and upgrade them and up-fit them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3295)|
| 0:54:57| and put new technology in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3297)|
| 0:54:59| I would think that that would be better for everyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3299)|
| 0:55:03| but going to a heavy industrial use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3303)|
| 0:55:05| could be problematic down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3305)|
| 0:55:07| Just curious if there's, Peter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3307)|
| 0:55:10| in this new zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3310)|
| 0:55:12| an option where we could get a use permitted on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3312)|
| 0:55:16| where it ties it specifically to this development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3316)|
| 0:55:19| and the site plan and this use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3319)|
| 0:55:21| where it doesn't just run with the land on the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3321)|
| 0:55:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3324)|
| 0:55:27| I don't think that's a great option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3327)|
| 0:55:31| That creates problems down the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3331)|
| 0:55:34| trying to manage basically limiting uses for a zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3334)|
| 0:55:42| Yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3342)|
| 0:55:44| You know, I have the same issue as Commissioner Uten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3344)|
| 0:55:48| They're trying to improve the situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3348)|
| 0:55:50| and improve technology,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3350)|
| 0:55:53| just having difficulty how we get to a sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3353)|
| 0:55:57| and what reasons for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3357)|
| 0:56:00| I will, Commissioner Scott Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3360)|
| 0:56:04| I'll recognize you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3364)|
| 0:56:05| Yeah, as I look through with another item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3365)|
| 0:56:10| on our agenda today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3370)|
| 0:56:12| I'll tell you the recode,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3372)|
| 0:56:14| I know there was a lot of effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3374)|
| 0:56:15| and it's really great what's been done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3375)|
| 0:56:17| but in the industrial area of this zoning code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3377)|
| 0:56:22| I think that we could do some work on some of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3382)|
| 0:56:24| because it just doesn't seem like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3384)|
| 0:56:25| like right now it's zoned IMU| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3385)|
| 0:56:27| and it just doesn't seem like that's what it should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3387)|
| 0:56:31| I have a question for the applicant in that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3391)|
| 0:56:32| is there anything that's going to go on at this facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3392)|
| 0:56:36| that is going to be more disruptive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3396)|
| 0:56:38| to adjoining property owners than has been going on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3398)|
| 0:56:42| Because I'm not hearing that it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3402)|
| 0:56:45| I'm just curious,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3405)|
| 0:56:48| is there anything different or any operations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3408)|
| 0:56:51| smoke, noise, vibration, anything that's going to change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3411)|
| 0:56:58| Thank you, Commissioner Smith for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3418)|
| 0:57:00| No, we are simply looking to remove old tanks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3420)|
| 0:57:08| that are not safe and efficient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3428)|
| 0:57:12| and replace those tanks with new ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3432)|
| 0:57:15| I'd also like to mention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3435)|
| 0:57:17| that we are not increasing any capacities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3437)|
| 0:57:22| We're simply removing tanks that are there now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3442)|
| 0:57:26| with new tanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3446)|
| 0:57:30| So none of our business operations will change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3450)|
| 0:57:33| We make asphalt emulsions there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3453)|
| 0:57:35| And if anything, this new technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3455)|
| 0:57:38| will improve our operations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3458)|
| 0:57:42| and limit any, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3462)|
| 0:57:45| there's really no noise involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3465)|
| 0:57:47| with what we're doing or smoke or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3467)|
| 0:57:51| So thank you for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3471)|
| 0:57:54| Well, thank you for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3474)|
| 0:57:55| Yeah, I mean, my gut feel on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3475)|
| 0:57:58| is I would be supportive of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3478)|
| 0:58:03| giving this zoning to these guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3483)|
| 0:58:04| And I feel like one of the problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3484)|
| 0:58:07| and the reasons we're in this quandary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3487)|
| 0:58:09| is we don't have good options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3489)|
| 0:58:11| under industrial zoning in this recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3491)|
| 0:58:17| But anyway, that's my thoughts on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3497)|
| 0:58:19| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3499)|
| 0:58:20| Chair recognizes Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3500)|
| 0:58:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3504)|
| 0:58:25| Thank you, Pat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3505)|
| 0:58:29| So I'm hearing that in the recode| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3509)|
| 0:58:31| that they were compliant before recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3511)|
| 0:58:34| And recode took the person's property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3514)|
| 0:58:37| that had an operating business on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3517)|
| 0:58:38| that was compliant, changed the zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3518)|
| 0:58:41| I struggled with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3521)|
| 0:58:42| And again, this is one of the reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3522)|
| 0:58:43| why I voted against recode| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3523)|
| 0:58:46| because I think it is weak in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3526)|
| 0:58:48| a lot of these areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3528)|
| 0:58:49| We took people's property and rezoned it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3529)|
| 0:58:52| And my question, one of my questions is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3532)|
| 0:58:54| it was I-2 before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3534)|
| 0:58:56| Is H-I and I-2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3536)|
| 0:58:57| are they relatively equivalent zones?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3537)|
| 0:59:01| That might be for staff to tell me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3541)|
| 0:59:03| The old I-2 and the new H-I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3543)|
| 0:59:07| Hi, this is Michelle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3547)|
| 0:59:13| I could speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3553)|
| 0:59:15| I was able to find the previous zoning code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3555)|
| 0:59:18| and if they're doing asphalt manufacturing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3558)|
| 0:59:23| or refining, that would have been approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3563)|
| 0:59:25| in the I-4 heavy industrial district of 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3565)|
| 0:59:29| So it would have been noncompliant prior to recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3569)|
| 0:59:33| It remains noncompliant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3573)|
| 0:59:36| So their situation has not changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3576)|
| 0:59:40| The zoning district names have changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3580)|
| 0:59:43| but it would have been a use by right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3583)|
| 0:59:47| in the I-4 of 2019 and an I-H of 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3587)|
| 0:59:54| How did the business ever get located there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3594)|
| 0:59:56| if it was nonconforming before that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3596)|
| 1:00:00| I do not know the answer to that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3600)|
| 1:00:03| This is Amy Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3603)|
| 1:00:06| I will say that based on the research| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3606)|
| 1:00:09| the staff's done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3609)|
| 1:00:10| this use has been there for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3610)|
| 1:00:12| I think in the staff report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3612)|
| 1:00:13| it identifies at least before the 1960s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3613)|
| 1:00:16| So it's been there for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3616)|
| 1:00:18| it's long been established as a use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3618)|
| 1:00:22| So I hope that answers your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3622)|
| 1:00:25| So it's long been established.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3625)|
| 1:00:26| It's been there that long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3626)|
| 1:00:28| but now we're coming back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3628)|
| 1:00:30| and I don't know what the impetus of this was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3630)|
| 1:00:33| Was it a building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3633)|
| 1:00:35| they requested a building permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3635)|
| 1:00:36| or some type of permit that caused codes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3636)|
| 1:00:40| to go over and tell them they're noncompliant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3640)|
| 1:00:43| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3643)|
| 1:00:44| Thanks for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3644)|
| 1:00:45| So is that what happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3645)|
| 1:00:47| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3647)|
| 1:00:49| Go ahead, Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3649)|
| 1:00:51| I'll go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3651)|
| 1:00:52| Yeah, they came in for a building permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3652)|
| 1:00:55| and we saw the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3655)|
| 1:00:57| based on the number of tanks being expanded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3657)|
| 1:00:59| we saw that as an expansion of a nonconforming use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3659)|
| 1:01:04| And so there are several options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3664)|
| 1:01:07| and the option that they chose was to seek a rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3667)|
| 1:01:11| So what were the other options?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3671)|
| 1:01:14| There's opportunities to go through BZA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3674)|
| 1:01:17| to expand a nonconforming use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3677)|
| 1:01:21| And I believe that we articulated that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3681)|
| 1:01:24| I think I'm pretty sure it wasn't me specifically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3684)|
| 1:01:27| but I'm pretty sure that we gave the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3687)|
| 1:01:30| all the options available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3690)|
| 1:01:33| I'm going to allow Mr. Giles to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3693)|
| 1:01:36| he has his hand up and we'll allow him to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3696)|
| 1:01:39| Mr. Giles, would you like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3699)|
| 1:01:46| Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3706)|
| 1:01:47| Yes, we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3707)|
| 1:01:49| I'd like to correct the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3709)|
| 1:01:51| We are not expanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3711)|
| 1:01:55| Everything that we are hoping to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3715)|
| 1:01:57| is within the current footprint of where our tanks are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3717)|
| 1:02:02| We are not adding tanks outside of that current footprint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3722)|
| 1:02:07| And as I said before, we are really looking to remove| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3727)|
| 1:02:13| old tanks and replace them with new tanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3733)|
| 1:02:15| So we're not trying to expand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3735)|
| 1:02:20| build new tanks outside of the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3740)|
| 1:02:23| where our tanks are currently located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3743)|
| 1:02:26| And then again, I think we were given the option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3746)|
| 1:02:30| to do the BZA appeals board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3750)|
| 1:02:34| but in the interest of kind of trying to streamline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3754)|
| 1:02:37| our efforts for these upgrades for our facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3757)|
| 1:02:41| it would be a lot easier and more efficient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3761)|
| 1:02:44| to be rezoned heavy industrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3764)|
| 1:02:46| than to go to the appeals board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3766)|
| 1:02:50| every single time we want to make an upgrade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3770)|
| 1:02:54| And again, I guess I'm just kind of curious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3774)|
| 1:02:58| what the difference between our neighboring property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3778)|
| 1:03:00| there on the Northwest side of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3780)|
| 1:03:03| being zoned heavy industrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3783)|
| 1:03:05| and they are really a lot closer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3785)|
| 1:03:08| to three times as many residential properties as we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3788)|
| 1:03:14| I guess that's just another kind of seems unfair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3794)|
| 1:03:17| that we aren't able to be zoned heavy industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3797)|
| 1:03:20| So I hope that helps answer the question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3800)|
| 1:03:23| and kind of clarify what our efforts are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3803)|
| 1:03:26| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3806)|
| 1:03:28| Chair recognizes Commissioner Corobolic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3808)|
| 1:03:32| I don't know if this applies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3812)|
| 1:03:33| since the use is non-conforming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3813)|
| 1:03:36| but I believe that when recode was adopted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3816)|
| 1:03:39| there was, if not a promise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3819)|
| 1:03:41| at least an understanding that property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3821)|
| 1:03:45| could return to the city to request zone comparable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3825)|
| 1:03:51| to what they had before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3831)|
| 1:03:56| That was my first observation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3836)|
| 1:03:58| The second is that I don't see why the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3838)|
| 1:04:02| can't get one big variance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3842)|
| 1:04:04| for all future improvements at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3844)|
| 1:04:08| And then I was also wondering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3848)|
| 1:04:10| if a change in technology,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3850)|
| 1:04:12| allowing the applicant to make the situation safer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3852)|
| 1:04:17| and more environmentally protective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3857)|
| 1:04:19| would constitute a change in condition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3859)|
| 1:04:24| which is the first part of amending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3864)|
| 1:04:28| the land use plan criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3868)|
| 1:04:34| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3874)|
| 1:04:35| Chair recognizes Commissioner Eason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3875)|
| 1:04:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3880)|
| 1:04:41| I think this is confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3881)|
| 1:04:44| I appreciate that the owner is making these upgrades| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3884)|
| 1:04:46| and that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3886)|
| 1:04:47| And I think my question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3887)|
| 1:04:49| is it best to make those upgrades| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3889)|
| 1:04:50| through going through BCA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3890)|
| 1:04:54| or by changing the zone of the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3894)|
| 1:04:58| And I think it seems even more logical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3898)|
| 1:05:04| to go through BCA now that I hear from Mr. Aarons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3904)|
| 1:05:10| that this was non-conforming previously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3910)|
| 1:05:12| and it is not non-conforming in the new code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3912)|
| 1:05:14| So it's not really a change from the new zoning code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3914)|
| 1:05:16| because it was non-conforming previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3916)|
| 1:05:19| It seems to me that going through BCA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3919)|
| 1:05:21| would be the better option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3921)|
| 1:05:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3924)|
| 1:05:26| Commissioner Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3926)|
| 1:05:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3931)|
| 1:05:32| I was looking at the parcel adjacent to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3932)|
| 1:05:36| the one that's zoned heavy industrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3936)|
| 1:05:39| and its sector plan is light industrial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3939)|
| 1:05:44| yet it is zoned heavy industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3944)|
| 1:05:47| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3947)|
| 1:05:50| Shouldn't it have a sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3950)|
| 1:05:53| that would be similar to what these folks are asking for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3953)|
| 1:06:00| Can I speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3960)|
| 1:06:02| This is Amy from Planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3962)|
| 1:06:06| So when you look at one of the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3966)|
| 1:06:08| that we tried to do was comparable zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3968)|
| 1:06:10| You hear that term quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3970)|
| 1:06:12| And so with the property to the north,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3972)|
| 1:06:14| Commissioner Smith, that you referenced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3974)|
| 1:06:15| it was previously zoned I-4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3975)|
| 1:06:18| which the equivalent to I-4| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3978)|
| 1:06:20| would be the heavy industrial zoning district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3980)|
| 1:06:23| And the property that we're discussing right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3983)|
| 1:06:25| was previously zoned I-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3985)|
| 1:06:27| And the equivalent to that was IG,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3987)|
| 1:06:29| which is that general industrial zoning district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3989)|
| 1:06:31| So there's four different classes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3991)|
| 1:06:33| of industrial districts within the new code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3993)|
| 1:06:35| And so that's why we're seeing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3995)|
| 1:06:37| And so that's why this applicant couldn't come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3997)|
| 1:06:39| and request what might have been the equivalent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=3999)|
| 1:06:44| because what they were previously zoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4004)|
| 1:06:47| was I-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4007)|
| 1:06:48| And so the equivalent would be IG and not the IH.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4008)|
| 1:06:52| Okay. So, but you see my questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4012)|
| 1:06:56| more along the lines of the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4016)|
| 1:06:58| And so they are in a sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4018)|
| 1:07:00| that really doesn't allow heavy industrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4020)|
| 1:07:02| or does light industrial sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4022)|
| 1:07:05| allow heavy industrial zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4025)|
| 1:07:07| No, you will see some mismatch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4027)|
| 1:07:09| throughout the city and the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4029)|
| 1:07:11| of what the sector plan might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4031)|
| 1:07:15| And actually what it's currently zoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4035)|
| 1:07:18| because a lot of these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4038)|
| 1:07:18| in particular the industrial properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4038)|
| 1:07:22| have been zoned industrial for many years, decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4042)|
| 1:07:26| So those, especially along the railroad tracks that you see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4046)|
| 1:07:29| So, during planning efforts in recent years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4049)|
| 1:07:33| those might've been changed in the land use plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4053)|
| 1:07:38| to a lesser industrial use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4058)|
| 1:07:40| to better reflect the changing conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4060)|
| 1:07:42| So that might be where the mismatch is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4062)|
| 1:07:44| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4064)|
| 1:07:47| Mr. Aarons, you're still with us, I hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4067)|
| 1:07:52| Yes. Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4072)|
| 1:07:53| Tennessee code is really specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4073)|
| 1:07:56| that it does permit expansion of non-conforming uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4076)|
| 1:08:01| provided there's reasonable land property for expansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4081)|
| 1:08:06| Does that require to go before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4086)|
| 1:08:08| the Board of Zoning Appeals or can that occur| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4088)|
| 1:08:14| by a staff function?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4094)|
| 1:08:17| That would need to go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4097)|
| 1:08:19| It would need to go to BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4099)|
| 1:08:22| As you guys were discussing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4102)|
| 1:08:23| I was going back through some of my old emails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4103)|
| 1:08:25| and I found that in conversations with planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4105)|
| 1:08:29| if they were not going to expand their use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4109)|
| 1:08:33| they could maintain their non-conforming use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4113)|
| 1:08:37| They could install new tanks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4117)|
| 1:08:39| but if they were expanding my,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4119)|
| 1:08:41| and I'm reading my email,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4121)|
| 1:08:42| I said, if the removal and installation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4122)|
| 1:08:44| results in expansion of the non-conforming use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4124)|
| 1:08:47| they can go through BZA or they could go and rezone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4127)|
| 1:08:53| So in order to expand a non-conforming use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4133)|
| 1:08:57| they do have to go through BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4137)|
| 1:08:58| It's not something that staff can approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4138)|
| 1:09:01| without that bodies over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4141)|
| 1:09:04| Peter, you're interpreting that adding equipment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4144)|
| 1:09:09| would require a BZA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4149)|
| 1:09:11| even though it's staying within the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4151)|
| 1:09:15| physical boundaries of what's there now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4155)|
| 1:09:18| like the tanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4158)|
| 1:09:20| According to Mr. Giles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4160)|
| 1:09:21| the tanks will be in the same footprint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4161)|
| 1:09:24| as the existing tanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4164)|
| 1:09:30| So what you're saying is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4170)|
| 1:09:32| regardless if it's staying in that same boundary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4172)|
| 1:09:35| if it's adding new equipment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4175)|
| 1:09:37| that would require a BZA action?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4177)|
| 1:09:39| If the volume that they were processing is increasing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4179)|
| 1:09:49| that would be an expansion of the use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4189)|
| 1:09:52| because it's an increase in intensity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4192)|
| 1:09:55| And so if they were just replacing the equipment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4195)|
| 1:10:06| and having the same volume of work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4206)|
| 1:10:09| the same volume of material passing through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4209)|
| 1:10:12| I would say that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4212)|
| 1:10:13| You can do that without going through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4213)|
| 1:10:18| the Board of Zoning Appeals or getting a rezone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4218)|
| 1:10:21| If they replaced with larger tanks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4221)|
| 1:10:28| which increases the intensity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4228)|
| 1:10:31| then I would say that would be an expansion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4231)|
| 1:10:33| of the non-conforming use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4233)|
| 1:10:36| And by expanding the non-conforming use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4236)|
| 1:10:38| they would need to go through BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4238)|
| 1:10:39| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4239)|
| 1:10:41| I'm going to allow Mr. Giles to pipe in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4241)|
| 1:10:46| Mr. Giles, would you like to speak please, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4246)|
| 1:10:49| Yes, thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4249)|
| 1:10:52| I guess given that definition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4252)|
| 1:10:55| if we took out a tank that was a 20,000 gallon tank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4255)|
| 1:10:59| and put in a 30,000 gallon tank,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4259)|
| 1:11:02| that according to Mr. Ayers there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4262)|
| 1:11:06| that that would be expansion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4266)|
| 1:11:08| even though it's still within that footprint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4268)|
| 1:11:13| So these tanks are on concrete pads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4273)|
| 1:11:19| Again, we're trying to make our operations more efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4279)|
| 1:11:25| And again, the technology from 1950| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4285)|
| 1:11:29| or about when this plant was built has come a long way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4289)|
| 1:11:34| And we feel that these new tanks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4294)|
| 1:11:36| will be better for the environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4296)|
| 1:11:38| They're better in terms of energy usage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4298)|
| 1:11:41| and everything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4301)|
| 1:11:42| So that's our big push for replacing these old tanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4302)|
| 1:11:52| And again, we would like to be consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4312)|
| 1:11:55| with the zoning and plot sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4315)|
| 1:12:02| So that's our main goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4322)|
| 1:12:06| A question, are you adding capacity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4326)|
| 1:12:10| Potentially, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4330)|
| 1:12:11| Okay, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4331)|
| 1:12:12| Yes, so some of the older tanks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4332)|
| 1:12:16| we would want to increase the capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4336)|
| 1:12:20| that the new tanks would hold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4340)|
| 1:12:25| And the big problem that we're having is with the height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4345)|
| 1:12:30| These tanks are, and we have tanks in there now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4350)|
| 1:12:33| that are about 40 feet tall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4353)|
| 1:12:38| So that's what these new tanks would all kind of be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4358)|
| 1:12:40| about that same size,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4360)|
| 1:12:41| which we have tanks in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4361)|
| 1:12:43| that are currently 40 feet tall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4363)|
| 1:12:45| It would just come down to what tank we were removing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4365)|
| 1:12:47| and what tank would be putting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4367)|
| 1:12:49| new tank would go in its spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4369)|
| 1:12:51| So I hope that helps clarify any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4371)|
| 1:12:55| All right, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4375)|
| 1:12:56| I appreciate your patience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4376)|
| 1:12:59| You're recognized Commissioner Eason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4379)|
| 1:13:02| Yeah, I just wanted to follow up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4382)|
| 1:13:04| on the sector plan conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4384)|
| 1:13:06| In thinking, looking at the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4386)|
| 1:13:08| that the sector plan is not industrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4388)|
| 1:13:10| and in commenting that we should be using zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4390)|
| 1:13:14| to move toward the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4394)|
| 1:13:17| That's, we should be moving away from the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4397)|
| 1:13:20| We should be moving toward the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4400)|
| 1:13:22| and doing that through zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4402)|
| 1:13:23| So I just wanted to say this seems like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4403)|
| 1:13:26| I definitely want the owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4406)|
| 1:13:27| to be able to make their upgrades,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4407)|
| 1:13:29| but it seems like that should go through BZA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4409)|
| 1:13:31| rather than us making sector plan changes and changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4411)|
| 1:13:36| All right, thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4416)|
| 1:13:37| Chair recognizes Commissioner Tim Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4417)|
| 1:13:42| Thank you, Chair Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4422)|
| 1:13:44| On one hand, I'm following Commissioner Eason's comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4424)|
| 1:13:48| and that's, I wanna go down that path to a point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4428)|
| 1:13:52| except when I revisit the question from the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4432)|
| 1:13:56| and he's asking how can my property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4436)|
| 1:14:00| be more restricted than his neighboring property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4440)|
| 1:14:04| that is heavy industrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4444)|
| 1:14:06| and the heavy industrial site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4446)|
| 1:14:08| is more impactful on the residents up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4448)|
| 1:14:12| So I'm really struggling with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4452)|
| 1:14:15| I think we all, I speculate we all want him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4455)|
| 1:14:18| to continue to operate and to upgrade his equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4458)|
| 1:14:22| If it takes changing the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4462)|
| 1:14:26| I could probably be in favor of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4466)|
| 1:14:28| I wish that we had gone to BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4468)|
| 1:14:32| I do have a question for the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4472)|
| 1:14:34| Mr. Giles, did you recognize this rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4474)|
| 1:14:37| and address it with the planning department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4477)|
| 1:14:41| when we were going through recode?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4481)|
| 1:14:45| Thank you, Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4485)|
| 1:14:48| No, we did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4488)|
| 1:14:49| Again, we are a long-term tenant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4489)|
| 1:14:54| We are not the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4494)|
| 1:14:57| We have a lease agreement with the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4497)|
| 1:15:03| And again, we have permission from them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4503)|
| 1:15:05| that I'd be happy to provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4505)|
| 1:15:07| to the commissioners and the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4507)|
| 1:15:09| but we were not involved in any of the recode| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4509)|
| 1:15:14| that happened in 2020| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4514)|
| 1:15:17| or notification of any of that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4517)|
| 1:15:22| Thank you, Chair Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4522)|
| 1:15:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4524)|
| 1:15:25| Chair recognizes Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4525)|
| 1:15:28| Yes, I'm curious about the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4528)|
| 1:15:31| If there is a consensus that this should go to BZA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4531)|
| 1:15:37| what's the process for doing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4537)|
| 1:15:39| from the case file that is in front of us right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4539)|
| 1:15:43| and the staff recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4543)|
| 1:15:45| that's in front of us right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4545)|
| 1:15:46| So if you wanted that route,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4546)|
| 1:15:52| someone, I guess, would have to make a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4552)|
| 1:15:53| to deny this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4553)|
| 1:15:56| at which point the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4556)|
| 1:15:57| would have to file a request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4557)|
| 1:15:59| similar to what they do with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4559)|
| 1:16:02| request with that board to hear their case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4562)|
| 1:16:05| and then the BZA would have their say on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4565)|
| 1:16:10| So that would be a motion to deny| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4570)|
| 1:16:13| with the encouragement to the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4573)|
| 1:16:17| to seek the need through BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4577)|
| 1:16:23| If you'd like to make that part of your motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4583)|
| 1:16:25| you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4585)|
| 1:16:25| I think they would probably seek that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4585)|
| 1:16:27| whether you made it a part of your motion or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4587)|
| 1:16:30| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4590)|
| 1:16:35| Commissioner Scotsman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4595)|
| 1:16:38| Yeah, this is such a tough one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4598)|
| 1:16:39| and it just seems like this company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4599)|
| 1:16:43| has been doing the same thing for a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4603)|
| 1:16:47| and it seems that what's changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4607)|
| 1:16:49| is the verbiage around the classification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4609)|
| 1:16:53| zoning-wise and description| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4613)|
| 1:16:55| of what this land should be used for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4615)|
| 1:16:57| but it doesn't seem like this company's changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4617)|
| 1:17:00| what they've been doing for many, many years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4620)|
| 1:17:03| and what they plan to continue to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4623)|
| 1:17:05| So in an effort to get off center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4625)|
| 1:17:07| I'm just going to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4627)|
| 1:17:10| That we approve the sector plan change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4630)|
| 1:17:13| from light industrial and stream protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4633)|
| 1:17:15| to heavy industrial and stream protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4635)|
| 1:17:17| because I feel like there's an error in the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4637)|
| 1:17:21| in terms of the property to the north,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4641)|
| 1:17:26| the recode changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4646)|
| 1:17:27| and I feel like this company's kind of gotten caught| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4647)|
| 1:17:29| in the middle of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4649)|
| 1:17:31| I'll second the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4651)|
| 1:17:32| And before we go to vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4652)|
| 1:17:41| that we have two people would still like to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4661)|
| 1:17:44| I'll recognize Commissioner Newton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4664)|
| 1:17:48| Yeah, I wish I'd have been able to ask this question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4668)|
| 1:17:49| before the motion was made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4669)|
| 1:17:51| but I'm curious with the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4671)|
| 1:17:57| how quick that you're wanting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4677)|
| 1:17:58| to get these improvements made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4678)|
| 1:18:01| I would even be willing to postpone for 60 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4681)|
| 1:18:03| and let him try to go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4683)|
| 1:18:04| the Board of Zoning Appeals process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4684)|
| 1:18:06| even though that just seems like a ton of hoops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4686)|
| 1:18:08| to make somebody jump through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4688)|
| 1:18:09| And I hate that this process is requiring somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4689)|
| 1:18:13| to jump through a bunch of hoops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4693)|
| 1:18:15| But if we did postpone it 60 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4695)|
| 1:18:17| you try to get the Board of Zoning Appeals route done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4697)|
| 1:18:21| If for some reason you didn't get that approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4701)|
| 1:18:24| you could still hold your place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4704)|
| 1:18:25| at the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4705)|
| 1:18:26| If we felt as a commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4706)|
| 1:18:29| that it wasn't just in what you were doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4709)|
| 1:18:32| maybe we could try to do it through the zoning route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4712)|
| 1:18:35| Just a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4715)|
| 1:18:40| Thank you, Commissioner Newton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4720)|
| 1:18:42| Our business is very seasonal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4722)|
| 1:18:46| We manufacture asphalt emulsions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4726)|
| 1:18:49| for the road construction industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4729)|
| 1:18:52| And as you all know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4732)|
| 1:18:53| that is the busiest in the summertime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4733)|
| 1:18:56| Our plans were to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4736)|
| 1:18:58| and we've already got an engineer working with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4738)|
| 1:19:03| to try to get these upgrades| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4743)|
| 1:19:05| or some of these upgrades done this winter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4745)|
| 1:19:09| in order to be used going into our busy season| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4749)|
| 1:19:12| next spring and summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4752)|
| 1:19:16| So that was kind of our goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4756)|
| 1:19:20| We have hopes to do these upgrades in phases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4760)|
| 1:19:24| you know, a few tanks at a time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4764)|
| 1:19:27| to upgrade our facility there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4767)|
| 1:19:30| So I hope that answers the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4770)|
| 1:19:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4775)|
| 1:19:37| Chair recognizes Commissioner Eason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4777)|
| 1:19:40| I had the same question as Commissioner Uden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4780)|
| 1:19:42| I was wondering if we could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4782)|
| 1:19:44| if we were to postpone this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4784)|
| 1:19:46| if that would give them time to drive the VZA route| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4786)|
| 1:19:49| because I definitely want them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4789)|
| 1:19:50| to be able to make the improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4790)|
| 1:19:52| My only concern is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4792)|
| 1:19:54| is this the right approach to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4794)|
| 1:19:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4796)|
| 1:19:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4797)|
| 1:19:58| Chair recognizes Commissioner Korbelik.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4798)|
| 1:20:02| I agree with Commissioner Uden and Eason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4802)|
| 1:20:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4808)|
| 1:20:09| Chair recognizes Commissioner Boyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4809)|
| 1:20:12| My concern with this logic of going to the VZA first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4812)|
| 1:20:17| is that what I'm hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4817)|
| 1:20:19| and Mr. Files, you can correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4819)|
| 1:20:22| this is not a one and done before the VZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4822)|
| 1:20:24| You're talking about going in stages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4824)|
| 1:20:26| You're talking about perhaps needing to go in multiple times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4826)|
| 1:20:30| And that was the reason why in the first place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4830)|
| 1:20:32| after you analyzed the options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4832)|
| 1:20:35| that were presented to you by planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4835)|
| 1:20:37| was that that's why you went this way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4837)|
| 1:20:40| to bring this before the entire planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4840)|
| 1:20:43| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4843)|
| 1:20:46| Thank you, Commissioner Boyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4846)|
| 1:20:48| Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4848)|
| 1:20:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4849)|
| 1:20:50| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4850)|
| 1:20:53| A lot of the assets and tanks that we have on site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4853)|
| 1:20:56| are quite old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4856)|
| 1:20:58| And our hopes are that we could over the next,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4858)|
| 1:21:01| you know, 5, 10 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4861)|
| 1:21:03| is that we could continue to upgrade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4863)|
| 1:21:06| most if not all of the assets that are on site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4866)|
| 1:21:12| Our business of manufacturing asphalt emulsions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4872)|
| 1:21:15| that's what it has been since 1950.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4875)|
| 1:21:19| And it will continue to be that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4879)|
| 1:21:22| That's what we will do hopefully for many years to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4882)|
| 1:21:25| at that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4885)|
| 1:21:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4889)|
| 1:21:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4889)|
| 1:21:30| Chair recognizes Commissioner Eddie Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4890)|
| 1:21:34| Thank you. And I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4894)|
| 1:21:35| I had a little audio glitch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4895)|
| 1:21:36| when the motion was being made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4896)|
| 1:21:37| So can someone just restate what the motion is clearly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4897)|
| 1:21:41| before we go into voting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4901)|
| 1:21:43| The motion is to approve the sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4903)|
| 1:21:47| from light industrial and stream protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4907)|
| 1:21:50| to heavy industrial and stream protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4910)|
| 1:21:54| So there's three motions required on this applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4914)|
| 1:21:58| This is just the first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4918)|
| 1:22:03| You okay? Is that all right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4923)|
| 1:22:06| Yes, I'm good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4926)|
| 1:22:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4927)|
| 1:22:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4928)|
| 1:22:09| Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4929)|
| 1:22:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4932)|
| 1:22:13| Thank you, Commissioner Phelps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4933)|
| 1:22:14| I want to go back to this existing business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4934)|
| 1:22:18| that's been there since 1950.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4938)|
| 1:22:19| Obviously somewhere between 1950 and now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4939)|
| 1:22:23| there were some zoning changes or sector plan changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4943)|
| 1:22:28| that happened that causes business to be non-conforming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4948)|
| 1:22:31| And we're hearing that they want to improve their business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4951)|
| 1:22:36| and make it safer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4956)|
| 1:22:37| Not necessarily in my mind make their footprint bigger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4957)|
| 1:22:42| or their impact on the area larger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4962)|
| 1:22:45| They're not doing anything different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4965)|
| 1:22:47| than they've done since 1950.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4967)|
| 1:22:49| And I've struggled with zoning changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4969)|
| 1:22:52| to existing operations that this stuff happens to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4972)|
| 1:22:56| I think it's incumbent on us to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4976)|
| 1:22:59| that there's something there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4979)|
| 1:23:01| There's some way that they can continue their operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4981)|
| 1:23:05| And when making them go to the BZA five or six times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4985)|
| 1:23:09| or 10 times or however many times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4989)|
| 1:23:11| they want to upgrade their facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4991)|
| 1:23:14| I think is redundant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4994)|
| 1:23:17| I think it's unnecessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4997)|
| 1:23:19| So I would second Commissioner Smith's motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=4999)|
| 1:23:25| Commissioner Roth, we already have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5005)|
| 1:23:27| I have a question for Peter Ahrens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5007)|
| 1:23:29| Peter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5009)|
| 1:23:33| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5013)|
| 1:23:34| If the applicant came in to the BZA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5014)|
| 1:23:39| could they do a plan that shows all the improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5019)|
| 1:23:43| they would like to meet to make over a period of time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5023)|
| 1:23:47| Or does it have to be on a project by project basis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5027)|
| 1:23:52| I would say, I don't think I've seen anybody go in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5032)|
| 1:23:57| because typically, the Board of Zoning Appeals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5037)|
| 1:24:00| is the least variance necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5040)|
| 1:24:04| And so to ask for something more than what the project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5044)|
| 1:24:09| is laying out, if they're going to ask for more than one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5049)|
| 1:24:14| I think it's a good idea to ask for more than one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5054)|
| 1:24:17| If they're going to ask for more than what their initial project is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5057)|
| 1:24:23| I think the Board of Zoning Appeals would need to deny it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5063)|
| 1:24:26| because the variances are based on basically permitting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5066)|
| 1:24:31| the least variance reasonable for them to use their land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5071)|
| 1:24:38| I'm talking myself in circles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5078)|
| 1:24:39| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5079)|
| 1:24:40| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5080)|
| 1:24:42| No, they can't ask for more than what they need for that project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5082)|
| 1:24:48| They would need to come in each and every time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5088)|
| 1:24:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5091)|
| 1:24:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5093)|
| 1:24:55| Let's get this moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5095)|
| 1:24:56| There is a motion on the floor by Commissioner Scott Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5096)|
| 1:25:00| seconded by Commissioner Hill to approve the sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5100)|
| 1:25:06| Ms. Karen, would you please call the roll?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5106)|
| 1:25:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5108)|
| 1:25:09| Commissioner Uten?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5109)|
| 1:25:11| Because of that last statement by City Codes about the multiple steps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5111)|
| 1:25:16| I'm going to reluctantly say yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5116)|
| 1:25:20| Commissioner Eddie Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5120)|
| 1:25:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5122)|
| 1:25:23| Commissioner Eason?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5123)|
| 1:25:28| This is a tough one, but I'm going to have to say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5128)|
| 1:25:32| Commissioner Buston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5132)|
| 1:25:37| I'm going to have to say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5137)|
| 1:25:39| Commissioner Dent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5139)|
| 1:25:44| Commissioner Dent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5144)|
| 1:25:47| I am going to go with no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5147)|
| 1:25:56| Commissioner Roth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5156)|
| 1:26:03| Yes, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5163)|
| 1:26:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5164)|
| 1:26:06| Commissioner Adams?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5166)|
| 1:26:10| I just want to reiterate that this is incredibly difficult,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5170)|
| 1:26:15| and hearing the length of the time that that company has been there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5175)|
| 1:26:22| and Commissioner Eason's thoughts about always trying to work towards the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5182)|
| 1:26:29| not away, you know, these two concepts are very,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5189)|
| 1:26:35| they're working against each other right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5195)|
| 1:26:37| and it seems like we're all in agreement we want the business to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5197)|
| 1:26:43| So for that reason, I'm going to vote yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5203)|
| 1:26:46| Commissioner Browning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5206)|

| 1:27:07| Commissioner Hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5227)|
| 1:27:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5228)|
| 1:27:10| I have 12 ayes and three nays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5230)|
| 1:27:14| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5234)|
| 1:27:16| Chair will entertain a motion to amend the one-year plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5236)|
| 1:27:21| from light industrial to heavy industrial and stream protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5241)|
| 1:27:26| I'll make a motion that we amend the one-year plan from light industrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5246)|
| 1:27:29| stream protection to heavy industrial stream protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5249)|
| 1:27:32| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5252)|
| 1:27:35| I'm sorry, who would second that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5255)|
| 1:27:37| Eddie Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5257)|

| 1:33:16| Um, next to item number 13, the applicant is Daniel D. and Kimberly Overby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5596)|
| 1:33:24| Property is located at southeast quadrant of intersection of Choteau Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5604)|
| 1:33:29| and South North Shore Drive on west side of Choteau Mill Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5609)|
| 1:33:35| The applicant is seeking a sector plan amendment from low density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5615)|
| 1:33:39| to neighborhood commercial and rezoning from agricultural to neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5619)|
| 1:33:45| Staff recommendation is denial of the sector plan amendment and denial of rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5625)|
| 1:33:51| This application will require two motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5631)|
| 1:33:59| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5639)|
| 1:34:01| Mr. Ewers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5641)|
| 1:34:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5643)|
| 1:34:05| Everybody hear me okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5645)|
| 1:34:07| We can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5647)|
| 1:34:08| We also have some opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5648)|
| 1:34:10| Would you like to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5650)|
| 1:34:12| Would you like the opposition to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5652)|
| 1:34:14| I would prefer to go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5654)|
| 1:34:18| I am representing the property owner, Brian Ewers, Bollard Ewers Architecture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5658)|
| 1:34:25| 111 East Jackson Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5665)|
| 1:34:28| My clients are partners that are seeking to purchase the property from Mr. Overby| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5668)|
| 1:34:36| and are currently in their due diligence period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5676)|
| 1:34:41| And we are requesting a 30-day postponement to the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5681)|
| 1:34:47| We are currently in discussions with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5687)|
| 1:34:53| at least three to four homeowner associations that the partnership has been talking to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5693)|
| 1:35:03| and discussing the opposition to their business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5703)|
| 1:35:09| There is some misinformation and misinterpretation of what they would be doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5709)|
| 1:35:17| and how they would be operating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5717)|
| 1:35:19| And they are currently meeting with the local neighborhoods to discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5719)|
| 1:35:27| and kind of come to a middle ground on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5727)|
| 1:35:31| They have been negotiating and receiving positive support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5731)|
| 1:35:39| And of course, you are well aware of the negative support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5739)|
| 1:35:42| So we would request additional time to, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5742)|
| 1:35:48| further pursue talking to the neighborhood and changing the negative into the positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5748)|
| 1:35:58| Thank you, Mr. Ewers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5758)|
| 1:35:59| So you are requesting a 30-day postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5759)|
| 1:36:02| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5762)|
| 1:36:03| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5763)|
| 1:36:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5763)|
| 1:36:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5764)|

| 1:36:23| and the potential property owner to reach a long-term solution for that lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5783)|
| 1:36:29| At the corner of Choteau and North Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5789)|

| 1:36:37| Make a motion to postpone for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5797)|

| 1:36:57| Is that the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5817)|

| 1:37:47| Motion carries unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5867)|
| 1:37:50| Next item is number 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5870)|
| 1:37:53| The applicant is Ben Mullins on behalf of Primos Land Company LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5873)|
| 1:37:59| Property is located north side of West Emory Road, west side of Blacks Ferry Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5879)|
| 1:38:05| The applicant is seeking rezoning from agricultural and general business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5885)|
| 1:38:09| to planned residential up to five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5889)|
| 1:38:14| Staff recommends rezoning the property to planned residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5894)|
| 1:38:18| up to four dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5898)|
| 1:38:20| This application will require just one motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5900)|
| 1:38:27| Mr. Mullins, are you present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5907)|
| 1:38:29| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5909)|
| 1:38:30| Ben Mullins, 550 West Main Street, suite 500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5910)|
| 1:38:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5913)|
| 1:38:34| And we do have someone to speak in opposition to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5914)|
| 1:38:39| Would you like to go first or would you like the opposition to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5919)|
| 1:38:43| I'll start out and then reserve some time for rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5923)|
| 1:38:47| I'm here on behalf of Primos Land Company who owns this 24.39 parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5927)|
| 1:38:56| This will be familiar to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5936)|
| 1:38:58| It was before you in May facing the similar opposition with similar objections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5938)|
| 1:39:06| It was approved by a vote of 11 to 1 back in May and went to county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5946)|
| 1:39:12| and was heard in both June and July county commission meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5952)|
| 1:39:17| There were some procedural issues with those meetings and the rezoning was ultimately denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5957)|
| 1:39:26| We came back to planning commission with a revised application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5966)|
| 1:39:32| One of the issues before county commission was whether or not we had access to West Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5972)|
| 1:39:38| The prior zoning application did not include the 2.1 acres that are fronting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5978)|
| 1:39:47| West Emory Road which are now zoned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5987)|
| 1:39:50| This application includes this in our rezoning application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5990)|
| 1:39:56| We had requested five dwelling units an acre which is what we also had requested in May| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=5996)|
| 1:40:01| when we were here before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6001)|
| 1:40:04| Just like staff did in May, they have come back and said we will recommend four dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6004)|
| 1:40:10| an acre and we are in agreement with staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6010)|
| 1:40:14| We are not asking to go above that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6014)|
| 1:40:17| I would say that there has been some question about the application of the hillside protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6017)|
| 1:40:24| on this property and the density allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6024)|
| 1:40:27| Staff, when they ran their analysis for the hillside protection density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6027)|
| 1:40:33| they came to 3.77 dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6033)|
| 1:40:38| I would point out that as a baseline for their calculation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6038)|
| 1:40:42| they used their recommended four dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6042)|
| 1:40:47| As you know, when there is a zero to 15 percent slope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6047)|
| 1:40:49| the recommendations allow you to have the full recommended density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6049)|
| 1:40:55| for the portion of land that is within that slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6055)|
| 1:41:00| Then it goes down depending upon the intensity of the slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6060)|
| 1:41:04| If you were to run it at our requested five dwelling units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6064)|
| 1:41:08| you would get 4.7 dwelling units an acre looking at the guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6068)|
| 1:41:13| We are between 3.77 and 4.7 depending on which way you were to start the calculations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6073)|
| 1:41:20| for the hillside protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6080)|
| 1:41:21| We believe we are right within the range of density per staff's recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6081)|
| 1:41:26| that would be appropriate for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6086)|
| 1:41:30| There are concerns about the infrastructure and traffic out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6090)|
| 1:41:33| since the application last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6093)|
| 1:41:37| Since it was denied in front of County Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6097)|
| 1:41:39| we have been able to secure a commitment from TDOT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6099)|
| 1:41:43| that we will have direct access to West Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6103)|
| 1:41:46| Also, since the denial, County Engineering has been able to secure and commit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6106)|
| 1:41:52| to improving the intersections of Carpenter Road and West Emory Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6112)|
| 1:41:56| and also the intersections of West Emory Road and Beaver Ridge Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6116)|
| 1:42:00| Since this denial in County Commission, there's been a change in County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6120)|
| 1:42:07| We think the staff got it right the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6127)|
| 1:42:09| We think the planning department got it right the first time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6129)|
| 1:42:11| but we've come back with a different plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6131)|
| 1:42:14| which addresses some of the concerns that County Commission had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6134)|
| 1:42:16| We would ask that this commission vote to approve per staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6136)|
| 1:42:23| Thank you, Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6143)|
| 1:42:26| Ms. McBee, are you available?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6146)|
| 1:42:28| I am. Can you hear me okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6148)|
| 1:42:30| Yes, we can. You have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6150)|
| 1:42:31| Give me your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6151)|
| 1:42:33| My name is Julie McBee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6153)|
| 1:42:35| I would prefer not to give my address at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6155)|
| 1:42:38| My zip code is 37931.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6158)|
| 1:42:40| I've spoken before with the MPC and the Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6160)|
| 1:42:46| Given the information from the Knox County Commission meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6166)|
| 1:42:49| both in June and July, there were several issues that were raised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6169)|
| 1:42:54| and one of them being the amount of traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6174)|
| 1:42:57| that is going to be coming out of this neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6177)|
| 1:43:00| onto an already dangerous road, which is Carpenter Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6180)|
| 1:43:05| and intersecting into Harold Road and West Emory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6185)|
| 1:43:10| Mr. Snowden, back in the meeting in June,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6190)|
| 1:43:14| and I'm going to paraphrase, it was around minute 40 in that presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6194)|
| 1:43:19| said that Emory Road was a high crash location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6199)|
| 1:43:23| and he doubted very seriously that TDOT was going to give permission for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6203)|
| 1:43:28| I actually had tried to contact TDOT today to obtain that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6208)|
| 1:43:33| I was not able to get a hold of anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6213)|
| 1:43:37| I think the problem with the meeting with the County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6217)|
| 1:43:41| was that neighborhood that had been slated to brunch the weight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6221)|
| 1:43:47| of this new development was a neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6227)|
| 1:43:50| that had been in establishment since 1970.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6230)|
| 1:43:54| There was no access that was granted at the time onto West Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6234)|
| 1:44:01| Having said that, there is still a major issue with traffic on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6241)|
| 1:44:07| To the left out of this neighborhood for post-subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6247)|
| 1:44:11| there is a blind curve that comes out of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6251)|
| 1:44:14| To the right of it, 0.2 miles, is the North Hampton Commons Boulevard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6254)|
| 1:44:20| that will be coming out of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6260)|
| 1:44:22| And then we get to the intersection of Carpenter, Harold, and West Emory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6262)|
| 1:44:26| I know that there's been a lot of talk about the plans of redoing that intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6266)|
| 1:44:32| However, there has not been anything done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6272)|
| 1:44:36| that the residents here in Carnes have been made aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6276)|
| 1:44:41| And when you go ahead and you've added these homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6281)|
| 1:44:44| back into that particular section of road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6284)|
| 1:44:50| those homes are going to be built before this expansion happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6290)|
| 1:44:54| So then we've got homes, we've got traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6294)|
| 1:44:57| and then on top of that, then we're going to have a construction zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6297)|
| 1:45:00| So I don't know that the timing is the appropriate time for all of this to occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6300)|
| 1:45:08| Having said that, Larson Jay, which is now the chairman of the County Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6308)|
| 1:45:13| and Mr. Biggs had driven these roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6313)|
| 1:45:17| And I'm paraphrasing again, all of this is documented on the meeting tape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6317)|
| 1:45:23| Said that there was no way and that this was probably a very bad plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6323)|
| 1:45:28| Sometimes you get a very bad piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6328)|
| 1:45:33| Mr. Smith himself stood before the County Commission and said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6333)|
| 1:45:36| he never looked at the area around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6336)|
| 1:45:38| Which to the Carnes community, that didn't bode very well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6338)|
| 1:45:43| because there's going to be a lot of people impacted in this community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6343)|
| 1:45:47| from not only this development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6347)|
| 1:45:49| but the current ones that have been approved and are currently going in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6349)|
| 1:45:53| Therefore, some of Smithville neighborhoods on top of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6353)|
| 1:45:58| We do are aware that there has been a lawsuit filed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6358)|
| 1:46:01| against the county for denial for this neighborhood going in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6361)|
| 1:46:05| So that led us to think that this is the other purpose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6365)|
| 1:46:09| for trying to get the rezoned off the commercial property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6369)|
| 1:46:14| that is adjacent to the Emery Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6374)|
| 1:46:17| The Carnes community has been extremely tolerant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6377)|
| 1:46:20| with the amount of construction and new development that has gone on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6380)|
| 1:46:24| And I think the people of Carnes, and I'm speaking for the majority of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6384)|
| 1:46:29| we would like to see the improvement before continued development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6389)|
| 1:46:34| We are aware there's going to be development and we're okay with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6394)|
| 1:46:39| But once again, we need to fix some of the problems within Carnes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6399)|
| 1:46:43| without adding 1,200 more vehicles on one section of road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6403)|
| 1:46:48| Like I said, we have been told there is going to be improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6408)|
| 1:46:53| but those improvements are not coming anytime soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6413)|
| 1:46:58| They're going to be down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6418)|
| 1:47:00| So instead of preventing the fire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6420)|
| 1:47:04| I think that things have gotten to the point right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6424)|
| 1:47:07| where the house is on fire and then we're going to think about how to stop it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6427)|
| 1:47:12| So we as a community would ask that this particular development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6432)|
| 1:47:19| I mean, even if it has to be put on pause for a little while| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6439)|
| 1:47:22| until we can get some things taken care of within our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6442)|
| 1:47:27| I know the area that is going in is not consistent with the area around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6447)|
| 1:47:34| And that's stated in the Northwest Knox County Sector Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6454)|
| 1:47:38| So those residents-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6458)|
| 1:47:39| Mr. McMay, excuse me, you need to wrap it up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6459)|
| 1:47:41| You've got four seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6461)|
| 1:47:43| Well, I did have four seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6463)|
| 1:47:45| So that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6465)|
| 1:47:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6466)|
| 1:47:47| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6467)|
| 1:47:48| Mr. Mullins, you have a minute 22 left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6468)|
| 1:47:50| Do you have any comments you'd like to make?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6470)|
| 1:47:52| Yes, I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6472)|
| 1:47:54| The sector plan calls for low-density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6474)|
| 1:47:56| which in the county is defined as five dwelling units per acre or less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6476)|
| 1:48:00| So we are completely consistent with the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6480)|
| 1:48:04| At County Commission, there was a lot of conversation about whether or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6484)|
| 1:48:08| we should or should be required to do a traffic impact analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6488)|
| 1:48:13| or present a concept plan prior to the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6493)|
| 1:48:16| And frankly, that puts the cart before the horse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6496)|
| 1:48:18| That's not required at the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6498)|
| 1:48:21| We're not going to be building these lots out until at least 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6501)|
| 1:48:28| We're trying to get ahead of the curve with our rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6508)|
| 1:48:31| So we can take the time to do the engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6511)|
| 1:48:34| to do the traffic impact analysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6514)|
| 1:48:37| determine exactly how we're going to need to contribute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6517)|
| 1:48:40| to any of the improvements to the infrastructure in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6520)|
| 1:48:44| There was a lot of concern because we did not have frontage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6524)|
| 1:48:48| in our past application to access West Emory Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6528)|
| 1:48:51| that the road would have to go onto Patriot Way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6531)|
| 1:48:54| which does have a stub out from that subdivision to our property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6534)|
| 1:48:59| or onto Carpenter Road or Blacks Ferry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6539)|
| 1:49:01| which are roads that do have some concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6541)|
| 1:49:05| We don't think we will need to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6545)|
| 1:49:07| If at the concept plan we're required to have a stub out into Patriot Way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6547)|
| 1:49:11| we still expect that the traffic impact analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6551)|
| 1:49:14| would show most of the traffic would come onto West Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6554)|
| 1:49:17| And I do have the transcript of-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6557)|
| 1:49:20| Mr. Moloch, unfortunately, your time is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6560)|
| 1:49:23| I'll be on here to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6563)|

| 1:49:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6565)|

| 1:49:31| Thank you, Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6571)|
| 1:49:33| I'd like to make a motion that we approve PR per staff recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6573)|
| 1:49:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6577)|
| 1:49:41| We have a motion by Commissioner Roth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6581)|
| 1:49:43| seconded by Commissioner Browning to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6583)|
| 1:49:45| PR planned residential up to four dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6585)|
| 1:49:50| Ms. Caron, would you please call the roll?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6590)|
| 1:49:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6592)|

| 1:50:02| Commissioner Dent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6602)|

| 1:51:47| Okay, just a second, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6707)|
| 1:51:49| Mr. Lansdon, would you like to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6709)|
| 1:51:51| Would you like the opposition to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6711)|
| 1:51:55| I'd feel free to have the opposition go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6715)|
| 1:51:57| All right, go ahead, Tobias.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6717)|
| 1:52:01| All right, like I said, my name is, okay, my name is Tobias Kite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6721)|
| 1:52:05| I live at 5405 Green Valley Drive, 37914, and I'm here on behalf of Town Hall East.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6725)|
| 1:52:13| I'm the vice president, so I'm here today on the board's behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6733)|
| 1:52:17| We are excited about Mr. Landon's project, but Town Hall East and the community have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6737)|
| 1:52:25| a lot of concerns about the rezoning to CG1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6745)|
| 1:52:29| Thus, we do not support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6749)|
| 1:52:31| The community also feels that they were not well informed about the zoning change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6751)|
| 1:52:38| We are also proposing that the rezoning cater to the project being specific, which is five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6758)|
| 1:52:47| acres is classified as residential on Mr. Lansdon's project, and two acres are only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6767)|
| 1:52:53| commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6773)|
| 1:52:55| So, we were possibly proposing for CG1 for the two acres, and either the RN4 or 6 or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6775)|
| 1:53:03| whichever one is better for his project for the remaining five acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6783)|
| 1:53:09| If that's not possible, we ask the city council to agree to initiate a rezone of this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6789)|
| 1:53:16| back to office or its equivalent under the current zoning code, should the proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6796)|
| 1:53:22| project not proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6802)|
| 1:53:24| So, with that said, we all hope good blessings for Mr. Lansdon's project, but if it doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6804)|
| 1:53:31| proceed, worst case scenario, we can rezone it back to office so the whole seven acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6811)|
| 1:53:37| would not be CG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6817)|
| 1:53:42| Thank you, Mr. Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6822)|

| 1:54:00| I've lived in the community, 5315, previously before my Clinch Avenue address for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6840)|
| 1:54:07| approximately 25 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6847)|
| 1:54:10| My grandmother was one of the founding members of Chihuahua Hills Baptist Church at its| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6850)|
| 1:54:14| previous location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6854)|
| 1:54:17| I met with Town Hall Lease several times with the previous rezoning on this property about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6857)|
| 1:54:25| three years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6865)|
| 1:54:26| My intentions were to take two existing hotel rooms of the former Holiday Inn and turn them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6866)|
| 1:54:34| into a one-bedroom senior apartment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6874)|
| 1:54:37| Town Hall Lease was receptive to the idea, hence the restrictions on the property in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6877)|
| 1:54:45| the rezoning, as it read, one-bedroom senior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6885)|
| 1:54:52| My consultant and I, Mark Bunch and associates, CCIN, I paid money for basically 40%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6892)|
| 1:55:02| completed architecture plans that I presented to Town Hall Lease that they were fine with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6902)|
| 1:55:09| spent money on attorney's fees, went to the IDB, and was successful in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6909)|
| 1:55:16| the bond allocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6916)|
| 1:55:18| But Mr. Bunch and I tried about half a dozen different ways to make one-bedroom cash flow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6918)|
| 1:55:24| out to service the debt, and we just couldn't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6924)|
| 1:55:28| So basically, I came back to rezone the property with what I'm currently requesting now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6928)|
| 1:55:35| Basically, we will demolish the existing hotel, do new construction, predominantly two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6935)|
| 1:55:42| bedrooms, and then the property facing Asheville Highway, two acres or less, somewhere in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6942)|
| 1:55:50| vicinity will be a neighborhood commercial conducive to the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6950)|
| 1:55:56| I met with Ms. Corblick and my architect, and I met with Ms. Corblick about over a month ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6956)|
| 1:56:03| via Town Hall Lease and gave her a detailed description.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6963)|
| 1:56:08| She even said that Town Hall Lease would want me to implement the mid-modern architecture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6968)|
| 1:56:15| in the apartments, and I was more than willing to do that as well as my architect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6975)|
| 1:56:22| So basically, that's what I'm proposing, and I'd like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6982)|
| 1:56:27| go with staff's recommendation on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=6987)|

| 2:00:23| We're really excited to talk about this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7223)|
| 2:00:27| This is a very important piece of property for the city of Knoxville and for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7227)|
| 2:00:32| We recognize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7232)|
| 2:00:34| We have, from the inception of this project, we have been reaching out to the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7234)|
| 2:00:42| to the Alice Bell Spring Hill Association, to Town Hall East, to Fountain City Town Hall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7242)|
| 2:00:48| to the East Town Village apartments who are adjacent to address their questions and concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7248)|
| 2:00:55| Because we expect and understand that there are going to be questions and concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7255)|
| 2:01:00| This site is, as you know, it's vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7260)|
| 2:01:05| There's some debate on whether it is blighted or on its way to be blighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7265)|
| 2:01:08| But it is definitely deteriorating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7268)|
| 2:01:11| And it has been for quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7271)|
| 2:01:13| In 2008, Dillard's closed its doors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7273)|
| 2:01:16| Dillard's was one of the primary anchor tenants for the mall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7276)|
| 2:01:20| They actually still own one of the four parcels that we have under contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7280)|
| 2:01:26| that's contingent upon the zoning and plan amendments that we're here today to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7286)|
| 2:01:33| It is our plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7293)|
| 2:01:35| Hillwood is a Texas developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7295)|
| 2:01:38| They develop property all across the nation and in the UK for e-commerce and fulfillment centers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7298)|
| 2:01:46| just like the one we are proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7306)|
| 2:01:49| They do it for a multitude of clients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7309)|
| 2:01:51| They do it for Wayfair, for Lowe's, for Walmart, for Amazon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7311)|
| 2:02:00| This is what they're known for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7320)|
| 2:02:02| I sent some information of prior developments they have done in Nashville, in Memphis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7322)|
| 2:02:09| in Jacksonville, Florida, and Houston, Texas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7329)|
| 2:02:12| I think it's one of the ones showing what this property may look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7332)|
| 2:02:19| They are looking to invest $70 to $80 million in this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7339)|
| 2:02:25| This is a unique piece of property in that it has access to the infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7345)|
| 2:02:30| It's flat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7350)|
| 2:02:32| So finding 80 acres of property that's flat in East Tennessee is very difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7352)|
| 2:02:37| It's also centrally located, which is key for this type of use to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7357)|
| 2:02:45| not only located close to residents that it could potentially deliver to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7365)|
| 2:02:51| but also to qualified workforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7371)|
| 2:02:53| This property has been going down the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7373)|
| 2:02:57| The infrastructure, the roads have been going down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7377)|
| 2:02:59| There are plans to make improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7379)|
| 2:03:01| both in TDOT and in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7381)|
| 2:03:03| We are studying those intersections and what can be done now as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7383)|
| 2:03:09| And we hope that in bringing this piece of property back up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7389)|
| 2:03:13| to being a vibrant piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7393)|
| 2:03:15| an economic producing piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7395)|
| 2:03:20| that that will help get those plans done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7400)|
| 2:03:22| which have been on hold for one reason or another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7402)|
| 2:03:26| I submitted a very detailed package yesterday to try to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7406)|
| 2:03:34| all the questions we've been hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7414)|
| 2:03:35| questions that were raised during agenda review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7415)|
| 2:03:38| regarding the zoning, regarding noise, regarding light, regarding traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7418)|
| 2:03:42| regarding the IG zone and why that is needed versus some of the other zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7422)|
| 2:03:49| even regarding why this is not going through the plan development process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7429)|
| 2:03:53| I know there's other people that want to talk about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7433)|
| 2:03:56| We are here to answer questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7436)|
| 2:03:58| We expect there to be a lot of questions today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7438)|
| 2:04:01| and we hope that we can have a nice conversation about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7441)|
| 2:04:03| and that in the end you'll recognize that this piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7443)|
| 2:04:08| lots of things have been talked about for it in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7448)|
| 2:04:11| what can be done, but nothing has happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7451)|
| 2:04:14| We have a client that is ready, willing, and able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7454)|
| 2:04:17| to turn this piece of property around and make it something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7457)|
| 2:04:21| that I think the city and the community can be proud of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7461)|
| 2:04:23| and we're prepared to, in that process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7463)|
| 2:04:26| address the concerns that the neighborhood and the apartments have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7466)|
| 2:04:31| With that, we would urge you to follow staff's recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7471)|
| 2:04:37| to recognize that because this property, the mall has closed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7477)|
| 2:04:42| has been vacant, and is deteriorating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7482)|
| 2:04:44| there is extreme change of conditions in this area for the plan amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7484)|
| 2:04:48| and we'd urge you to vote per staff's recommendation for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7488)|
| 2:04:52| Thank you, Mr. Bones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7492)|
| 2:04:54| I also want to bring out that Mr. Maddox and Mr. Clark| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7494)|
| 2:04:57| have also signed up to speak on the project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7497)|
| 2:05:02| and I also noticed that Mr. Lawyer with the Knoxville Chamber is not an opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7502)|
| 2:05:09| I assume he's willing to speak for the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7509)|
| 2:05:12| So Mr. Maddox or Mr. Clark, would you all like to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7512)|
| 2:05:17| or would you like to defer and hear the other individuals first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7517)|
| 2:05:21| Yes, we'll go ahead and speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7521)|
| 2:05:24| This is Steve Maddox, and I have Brandon Clark here with me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7524)|
| 2:05:29| and maybe the Planning Commission will remember,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7529)|
| 2:05:34| here about two years ago, you all approved a subdivision for us there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7534)|
| 2:05:40| just about a quarter of a mile from this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7540)|
| 2:05:44| It's the largest residential subdivision that's been approved in Knox City| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7544)|
| 2:05:49| in something like 20 years, and included 261 lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7549)|
| 2:05:55| and the property lays good, has all utilities with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7555)|
| 2:05:59| it was approved by City Council, and it's a great development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7559)|
| 2:06:04| However, the reason I would like to speak is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7564)|
| 2:06:08| because we have not been able to get much traction with that development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7568)|
| 2:06:13| as far as anybody ready to come in and build homes in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7573)|
| 2:06:19| and one of the biggest problems that we run into is that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7579)|
| 2:06:27| or objections is, that everybody is really worried about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7587)|
| 2:06:31| what is going to happen with this mall, the old mall property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7591)|
| 2:06:35| Mr. Maddox, Mr. Maddox, can I interrupt you for one minute?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7595)|
| 2:06:39| I'm going to extend the applicant's time to speak for an additional five minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7599)|
| 2:06:46| and that will also allow others to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7606)|
| 2:06:49| either for opposition to the project, an additional five minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7609)|
| 2:06:53| so you will have a total of 10 minutes, and you've already used five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7613)|
| 2:06:56| so continue, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7616)|
| 2:06:59| Thank you, and so that is the biggest detriment that we ran into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7619)|
| 2:07:06| in getting the residential development to move forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7626)|
| 2:07:10| so we would like to speak positively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7630)|
| 2:07:13| and ask the Commission to vote in favor of this development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7633)|
| 2:07:17| because we believe that it will be a real boost to that community out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7637)|
| 2:07:24| and will bring in a lot of residential and other type of development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7644)|
| 2:07:29| that would be good for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7649)|
| 2:07:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7651)|
| 2:07:33| Thank you. Mr. Clark, would you like to speak, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7653)|
| 2:07:37| Yes, I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7657)|
| 2:07:38| Just along the same lines as what Steve has said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7658)|
| 2:07:41| I would just like to echo that in talking to folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7661)|
| 2:07:44| that want to invest in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7664)|
| 2:07:46| you know, your local builders and regional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7666)|
| 2:07:49| that we brought in to look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7669)|
| 2:07:50| that's the main question that they've had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7670)|
| 2:07:52| is they've had to drive past the mall to look at the area there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7672)|
| 2:07:57| and it gives them the first impression that it's a blighted area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7677)|
| 2:08:00| and a blighted part of town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7680)|
| 2:08:01| and the town has a lot of potential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7681)|
| 2:08:04| and we just want to see that realized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7684)|
| 2:08:06| so we're just speaking in favor of the staff's recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7686)|
| 2:08:09| to approve this request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7689)|
| 2:08:12| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7692)|
| 2:08:16| Mr. Murphy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7696)|
| 2:08:22| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7702)|
| 2:08:23| My name is Kevin Murphy, 4508 Murphy Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7703)|
| 2:08:27| I'd like to say I'm speaking on behalf of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7707)|
| 2:08:31| Alice Bell Spring Hills Neighborhood Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7711)|
| 2:08:33| I've been, and I appreciate Mr. Mullins| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7713)|
| 2:08:37| and the applicant reached out to Alice Bell over a month ago about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7717)|
| 2:08:42| so I want to first acknowledge and say thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7722)|
| 2:08:45| for the dialogue that's happened to this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7725)|
| 2:08:49| and the first thing is the site plan that's been presented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7729)|
| 2:08:53| the type of use, the commitment to reduce noise is really good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7733)|
| 2:09:00| and I think the community is generally on the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7740)|
| 2:09:04| okay, this could be a good reuse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7744)|
| 2:09:05| and it would get the mall back to being used that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7745)|
| 2:09:09| so what's being proposed from a community standpoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7749)|
| 2:09:14| is reasonably acceptable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7754)|
| 2:09:17| but the challenge is that what's being asked in this request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7757)|
| 2:09:21| is a rezoning up to a general industrial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7761)|
| 2:09:23| which doesn't, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7763)|
| 2:09:26| there's no binding for any of the commitments that are made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7766)|
| 2:09:28| for noise, for site plan layout, or anything like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7768)|
| 2:09:33| and I think that's what is really the hard issue for the committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7773)|
| 2:09:36| and also for all of you as planning commissioners is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7776)|
| 2:09:40| you know, the request that's in front of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7780)|
| 2:09:42| is rezoning to industrial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7782)|
| 2:09:43| more intensive use that's adjacent to some commercial and residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7783)|
| 2:09:48| and that just seems like it's too broad of a request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7788)|
| 2:09:53| so, you know, we would, you know, I really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7793)|
| 2:09:55| personally, I think the plan development process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7795)|
| 2:09:57| would be a great avenue for this to have gone through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7797)|
| 2:10:00| and would love to see the applicant, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7800)|
| 2:10:01| apply, you know, to do this through plan development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7801)|
| 2:10:05| that way all those conditions can be, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7805)|
| 2:10:07| and promises and commitments can be made binding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7807)|
| 2:10:10| the use variance is a very strict and limited one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7810)|
| 2:10:13| you know, so that seems like that's the right process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7813)|
| 2:10:16| and, you know, I just want to emphasize that I think we're,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7816)|
| 2:10:20| that's the, you know, we have the same discomfort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7820)|
| 2:10:22| that many of you may have as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7822)|
| 2:10:24| so that's really most one-on-one safe, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7824)|
| 2:10:28| Thank you, Mr. Nelson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7828)|
| 2:10:37| I apologize, took me a while to get my mute off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7837)|
| 2:10:40| yes, I'm Kurt Nelson, and I'm with Hillwood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7840)|
| 2:10:42| and as Ben said, he really introduced it on our behalf,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7842)|
| 2:10:47| so I don't have anything to say at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7847)|
| 2:10:48| unless there's some questions that come back to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7848)|
| 2:10:50| other than to say that we are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7850)|
| 2:10:53| we think this could be a good project for the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7853)|
| 2:10:55| and we really are focused on addressing the needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7855)|
| 2:10:58| of the citizens around there, the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7858)|
| 2:11:01| and what you all have said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7861)|
| 2:11:03| and I'm in process of doing that with our customer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7863)|
| 2:11:06| that nothing happens quickly with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7866)|
| 2:11:09| but we're working towards that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7869)|
| 2:11:11| and I can tell you that both we and the customer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7871)|
| 2:11:15| understand the concerns, and they want to focus on them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7875)|
| 2:11:17| the best they can, so with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7877)|
| 2:11:21| that's all I have to say for now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7881)|
| 2:11:22| and I'll be ready to answer any questions that come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7882)|
| 2:11:24| Thank you, Mr. Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7884)|
| 2:11:31| David Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7891)|
| 2:11:40| Mr. Brown, would you desire to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7900)|
| 2:11:42| or are you...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7902)|
| 2:11:49| Doug Lawyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7909)|
| 2:11:51| Thank you, Chairman Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7911)|
| 2:11:52| Can you all hear me okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7912)|
| 2:11:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7914)|
| 2:11:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7914)|
| 2:11:56| My name is Doug Lawyer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7916)|
| 2:11:57| Vice President of Economic Development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7917)|
| 2:11:59| with the Knoxville Chamber, 17 Market Square, 37902,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7919)|
| 2:12:02| and I emailed the commissioners yesterday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7922)|
| 2:12:06| I just wanted to come on the Zoom call today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7926)|
| 2:12:09| to reiterate a couple of my points, I'll be brief,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7929)|
| 2:12:11| but I really wanted to paint the picture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7931)|
| 2:12:14| of the economic development angle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7934)|
| 2:12:16| of this opportunity for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7936)|
| 2:12:19| Projects of this magnitude with these many jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7939)|
| 2:12:23| that have the potential to be created at this site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7943)|
| 2:12:26| do not come along very often,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7946)|
| 2:12:28| and I think we're in a unique position as a community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7948)|
| 2:12:31| to have this site and to have a developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7951)|
| 2:12:34| and then a team behind it that is able to pull this off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7954)|
| 2:12:37| So not just the 500 to maybe up to 1,000 direct jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7957)|
| 2:12:42| that the end user might create at this location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7962)|
| 2:12:45| but the impact of all the indirect jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7965)|
| 2:12:48| that would support all those businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7968)|
| 2:12:51| that are around this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7971)|
| 2:12:53| the retail, the restaurants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7973)|
| 2:12:55| I think can be a tremendous boost to the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7975)|
| 2:12:58| And then the last thing is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7978)|
| 2:13:00| I don't know that it's been discussed too much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7980)|
| 2:13:02| but the site is currently served by public transit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7982)|
| 2:13:05| with Knoxville Area Transit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7985)|
| 2:13:08| I'm putting on my hat as chairman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7988)|
| 2:13:10| of the Knoxville Transit Authority Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7990)|
| 2:13:14| to say that this is an awesome opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7994)|
| 2:13:17| for our community to link public transit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7997)|
| 2:13:19| to a major employment opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=7999)|
| 2:13:22| to help our citizens get to and from some really good jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8002)|
| 2:13:25| that hopefully can be created here shortly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8005)|
| 2:13:28| So with that, I'll pause, and thanks for the opportunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8008)|
| 2:13:32| and thanks for what you guys are doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8012)|
| 2:13:33| on the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8013)|
| 2:13:34| Thank you, Mr. Lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8014)|
| 2:13:36| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8016)|
| 2:13:44| Mr. Brown, would you like to speak here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8024)|
| 2:13:46| We notice your hand's raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8026)|
| 2:13:55| All right, we'll move on to commission comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8035)|
| 2:13:59| Chair will recognize Commissioner Tim Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8039)|
| 2:14:04| Thank you, Chair Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8044)|
| 2:14:06| I intend, unless I hear something otherwise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8046)|
| 2:14:10| to vote in support of this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8050)|
| 2:14:12| However, I didn't get comfortable with it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8052)|
| 2:14:17| until yesterday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8057)|
| 2:14:17| and I think it's important to note| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8057)|
| 2:14:20| as to why I had so much trouble| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8060)|
| 2:14:22| getting comfortable with this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8062)|
| 2:14:24| I haven't heard much opposition to this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8064)|
| 2:14:27| but I've heard more of opposition as to the strategy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8067)|
| 2:14:32| This project is tailor-made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8072)|
| 2:14:36| for the planned development process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8076)|
| 2:14:39| It would give the community more protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8079)|
| 2:14:44| in the now and in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8084)|
| 2:14:46| and for some that aren't that familiar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8086)|
| 2:14:49| with planned development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8089)|
| 2:14:50| the underlying zoning designation does not go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8090)|
| 2:14:54| So if they left town in 10, 20 years, whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8094)|
| 2:14:58| it goes back to the pre-existing zoning designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8098)|
| 2:15:03| because it never went away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8103)|
| 2:15:05| So I want to, but that may be the best strategy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8105)|
| 2:15:10| but it may not be the necessary strategy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8110)|
| 2:15:13| The applicant has indicated and voiced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8113)|
| 2:15:17| the need for speed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8117)|
| 2:15:20| and time kills deals in this industry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8120)|
| 2:15:24| and they may be trying to keep contracts in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8124)|
| 2:15:28| You know, contracts expire, markets change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8128)|
| 2:15:31| There are a number of reasons that deals die.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8131)|
| 2:15:34| So I guess I'm going to trust| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8134)|
| 2:15:38| that these gentlemen are accurate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8138)|
| 2:15:40| in how they represent that the planned development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8140)|
| 2:15:45| would be too lengthy for their needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8145)|
| 2:15:47| to make this deal go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8147)|
| 2:15:49| But I do want to present a likely scenario| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8149)|
| 2:15:54| so that the public will understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8154)|
| 2:15:56| that there are embedded risks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8156)|
| 2:15:59| And one of the risks is they start their due diligence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8159)|
| 2:16:04| And let's say there are massive traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8164)|
| 2:16:08| transportation infrastructure upgrade requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8168)|
| 2:16:13| and we've rezoned this IG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8173)|
| 2:16:17| Now the developer has all of the leverage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8177)|
| 2:16:21| against our municipality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8181)|
| 2:16:23| And when I say that, they could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8183)|
| 2:16:25| one strategy, and it's not a dubious strategy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8185)|
| 2:16:27| I mean, this is just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8187)|
| 2:16:28| you don't know these things until you get in them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8188)|
| 2:16:30| but we've already rezoned it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8190)|
| 2:16:32| So let's say there are millions of dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8192)|
| 2:16:35| of infrastructure costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8195)|
| 2:16:36| Well, as a developer, I would say city, TDOT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8196)|
| 2:16:40| you guys need to make these improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8200)|
| 2:16:42| or I need a TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8202)|
| 2:16:44| And that's not a bad thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8204)|
| 2:16:45| and it could be a reasonable request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8205)|
| 2:16:47| but the public needs to be aware| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8207)|
| 2:16:51| of those potential requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8211)|
| 2:16:54| The reason I got comfortable with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8214)|
| 2:16:57| is because I called the deputy, the mayor yesterday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8217)|
| 2:17:00| and we had a conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8220)|
| 2:17:01| and she is committed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8221)|
| 2:17:03| And I want to hear from her today, Stephanie Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8223)|
| 2:17:06| She has committed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8226)|
| 2:17:07| and she has gotten an interpretation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8227)|
| 2:17:09| from the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8229)|
| 2:17:11| that they can initiate a rezoning request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8231)|
| 2:17:15| to get it back to the appropriate zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8235)|
| 2:17:18| And because of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8238)|
| 2:17:19| I don't fear that in the event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8239)|
| 2:17:22| this project could not go forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8242)|
| 2:17:25| or they leverage the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8245)|
| 2:17:27| or potentially re-market the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8247)|
| 2:17:30| we still have a vehicle to get it back to its zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8250)|
| 2:17:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8255)|
| 2:17:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8255)|
| 2:17:37| Chair recognizes Commissioner Depp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8257)|
| 2:17:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8260)|
| 2:17:42| I have quite a bit to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201008?start=8262)|
