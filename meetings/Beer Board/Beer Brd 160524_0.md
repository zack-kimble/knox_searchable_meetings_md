| 0:00:30| I have several announcements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160524?start=30)|
| 0:00:31| The council will vote tonight, or we will be planning to move the beer board meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160524?start=31)|
| 0:00:36| to 5 p.m. in July instead of 6 p.m. with council at 6 and that will be beginning in July, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160524?start=36)|
| 0:00:46| think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160524?start=46)|

| 0:01:11| Beer board members, we're still saving trees and from the number of deferrals tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160524?start=71)|
| 0:01:16| we'll be having a lot of trees to save.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160524?start=76)|
| 0:01:20| The first case tonight is the American Cancer Society and I don't think anyone's here from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160524?start=80)|
| 0:01:27| the Cancer Society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160524?start=87)|

| 0:02:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160524?start=153)|
| 0:02:34| Now, tell us about your event on June 11th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160524?start=154)|
| 0:02:36| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160524?start=156)|
| 0:02:37| It's our annual craft beer kickoff for Knoxville Craft Beer Week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160524?start=157)|
| 0:02:41| We do it at the Farmer's Market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160524?start=161)|
| 0:02:43| So it's two Saturdays from now on the 11th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160524?start=163)|
| 0:02:46| It's basically a little tasting with our up-and-coming local beer scene,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160524?start=166)|
| 0:02:50| and we raise some money for Big Brothers and Big Sisters of East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160524?start=170)|
| 0:02:55| So $5 gets you four pours and a chance to meet some of our great brewers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160524?start=175)|
| 0:02:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160524?start=179)|
| 0:03:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160524?start=180)|
| 0:03:02| Next is the Butler & Bailey Market on North Shore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160524?start=182)|
| 0:03:06| and they have asked to defer until December 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160524?start=186)|
| 0:03:09| Is there anybody here from Butler & Bailey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160524?start=189)|
| 0:03:11| When?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160524?start=191)|
| 0:03:12| To when?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160524?start=192)|
| 0:03:13| December 20th, and let me explain why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160524?start=193)|
| 0:03:16| They have applied for the beer permit to have on premise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160524?start=196)|
| 0:03:22| They were not really thinking about the little church that is in storefront behind their building that's 79 feet away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160524?start=202)|
| 0:03:32| That church will be moving by the end of this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160524?start=212)|
| 0:03:36| so they would like us to defer so that they can come back in December| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160524?start=216)|
| 0:03:41| and quickly get their beer permit before something else moves in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160524?start=221)|
| 0:03:46| So I know that that's an extraordinarily long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160524?start=226)|
| 0:03:51| Comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160524?start=231)|

| 0:03:55| Whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160524?start=235)|
| 0:03:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160524?start=236)|
| 0:03:57| Do I have a motion to defer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160524?start=237)|
| 0:03:58| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160524?start=238)|
| 0:03:59| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160524?start=239)|
| 0:04:00| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160524?start=240)|
| 0:04:01| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160524?start=241)|
| 0:04:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160524?start=242)|
| 0:04:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160524?start=243)|
| 0:04:08| Save trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160524?start=248)|
| 0:04:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160524?start=251)|
| 0:04:12| Next is the Dollar General on Washington Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160524?start=252)|
| 0:04:16| Is Sheila Hayes here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160524?start=256)|
| 0:04:20| Well, I talked to Sheila Hayes this afternoon, and they are adding a manager's application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160524?start=260)|
| 0:04:26| and that person will take the task class and get the background prints done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160524?start=266)|
| 0:04:31| and they will be ready by the June 21st meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160524?start=271)|
| 0:04:35| So do I have a motion to defer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160524?start=275)|
| 0:04:37| Moved to defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160524?start=277)|
| 0:04:38| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160524?start=278)|

| 0:04:42| I spent a lot of time on the phone this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160524?start=282)|
| 0:04:46| Next is the East Tennessee Equality Festival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160524?start=286)|
| 0:04:51| Counsel, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160524?start=291)|
| 0:04:55| Spent at Pride Fest on June the 18th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160524?start=295)|
| 0:04:58| And before you start, I want to say they have got the best server plan that I have seen anybody submit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160524?start=298)|
| 0:05:04| I would expect no less from you, considering where you work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160524?start=304)|
| 0:05:07| but it is really a great model that we will be sharing with some others who don't get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160524?start=307)|
| 0:05:12| Now, your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160524?start=312)|

| 0:05:22| It is bad when you just move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160524?start=322)|

| 0:05:40| Do you want to tell us anything about Pride Fest?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160524?start=340)|
| 0:05:41| Knoxville Pride Fest, this is our 11th year under the new ETEC organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160524?start=341)|
| 0:05:48| We moved the parade to 11 this year, so we're actually going to be an hour longer in Worlds Far Apart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160524?start=348)|
| 0:05:53| Last year we became the largest free pride in the state of Tennessee, little old scruffy city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160524?start=353)|
| 0:05:59| We had about 28,000 people on Pride Day in Worlds Far Apart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160524?start=359)|
| 0:06:03| So hopefully we'll get a little bigger this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160524?start=363)|
| 0:06:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160524?start=365)|

| 0:06:08| All right, next is El Zocalo, and they have withdrawn their application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160524?start=368)|
| 0:06:18| Moving right along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160524?start=378)|

| 0:14:26| Cholo Taqueria, that's now Chivo, got their permit this week, so crossed them off the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160524?start=866)|

| 0:14:57| week of June timeframe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160524?start=897)|

| 0:15:05| As we discussed earlier, it's an older building, so I think that's just slowed them down a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160524?start=905)|
| 0:15:10| little bit, and they're hopeful and confident that second week of June, around there, they'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160524?start=910)|
| 0:15:16| be ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160524?start=916)|

| 0:17:20| So now this week – I think tomorrow we might have plumbing rough-in inspections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160524?start=1040)|
| 0:17:27| and by beginning of next week we should have finished rough-in for electrical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160524?start=1047)|
| 0:17:36| And after that I'm going to have a little bit delay on my pavers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160524?start=1056)|
