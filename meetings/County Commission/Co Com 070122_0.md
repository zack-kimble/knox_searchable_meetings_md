| 0:00:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=58)|
| 0:01:05| Members of the Beer Board, you received a copy of last month's minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=65)|

| 0:01:13| Mr. Lothold moves to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=73)|
| 0:01:16| Mr. Schmid seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=76)|
| 0:01:17| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=77)|
| 0:01:18| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=78)|
| 0:01:19| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=79)|
| 0:01:20| It's unanimous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=80)|
| 0:01:21| At this time, we're going to ask the law director to swear in any individual who's here to speak either for or against any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=81)|
| 0:01:29| item that's on our agenda, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=89)|
| 0:01:31| So if you're here either as an applicant or to speak to the application, if you would please stand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=91)|
| 0:01:35| the law director will ask you to raise your right hand and swear you in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=95)|
| 0:01:47| Each of you, through your testimony here today, swear or affirm to tell the truth, the whole truth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=107)|
| 0:01:51| and nothing but the truth, so help you God.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=111)|
| 0:01:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=114)|
| 0:01:56| It kind of looked to me like it was just staff that stood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=116)|
| 0:02:00| So we'll see if we have any business to conduct today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=120)|
| 0:02:03| Madam Clerk, would you call item 5A into the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=123)|
| 0:02:06| This is an application for Maria D. Garcia at L. Ray, Exeteca, at 3515 West Emery Road for on-premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=126)|
| 0:02:19| Ms. Garcia, if you'll come to the podium right down here, just walk anywhere you need to get to, to get to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=139)|
| 0:02:30| Did you raise your right hand, Ms. Garcia?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=150)|
| 0:02:32| No, I didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=152)|
| 0:02:33| Okay, you're about to, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=153)|
| 0:02:35| Ms. Garcia, do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=155)|
| 0:02:40| Yes, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=160)|
| 0:02:43| All right, at this time, Ms. Garcia, the law director is going to ask you a series of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=163)|
| 0:02:48| And if you'll answer each one truthfully, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=168)|
| 0:02:52| All right, Ms. Garcia, have you or any of your employees been convicted of any violation of the laws against possession,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=172)|
| 0:02:58| sale, manufacture, or transportation of intoxicating liquor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=178)|
| 0:03:02| or of any crime involving moral turpitude within the past ten years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=182)|
| 0:03:05| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=185)|
| 0:03:07| Has beer been sold at this location before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=187)|
| 0:03:10| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=190)|
| 0:03:12| So there's no outstanding license, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=192)|
| 0:03:14| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=194)|
| 0:03:15| Is it for on or off premises or both?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=195)|
| 0:03:19| Just on premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=199)|
| 0:03:21| Do you own the premises?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=201)|
| 0:03:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=202)|
| 0:03:24| Does anyone else have an interest in the business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=204)|
| 0:03:28| Or is it just you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=208)|
| 0:03:29| Are you the sole owner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=209)|
| 0:03:30| Yes, it's me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=210)|
| 0:03:35| Your application states that the property owner is Powell Place Center, LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=215)|
| 0:03:40| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=220)|
| 0:03:41| Is that you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=221)|
| 0:03:44| I'm the person, the people that rent it out to us, the lease people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=224)|
| 0:03:48| So you lease the premises?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=228)|
| 0:03:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=229)|
| 0:03:50| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=230)|
| 0:03:51| And you're going to be the person operating the business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=231)|
| 0:03:53| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=233)|
| 0:03:55| So you're familiar with the beer laws and regulations, and you agreed to conduct this business in conformity with them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=235)|
| 0:04:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=240)|
| 0:04:01| Have you completed a server training program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=241)|
| 0:04:04| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=244)|
| 0:04:06| Do you have a schedule to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=246)|
| 0:04:08| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=248)|
| 0:04:09| They gave me a paper to go to a class, but they gave me the off-premises class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=249)|
| 0:04:14| I had to go to the on-premises class, so I went to the wrong class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=254)|
| 0:04:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=257)|
| 0:04:19| As far as reports, Health Department, do you have a report?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=259)|
| 0:04:22| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=262)|
| 0:04:23| Sheriff's Department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=263)|
| 0:04:25| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=265)|
| 0:04:26| Beer Board Inspector?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=266)|
| 0:04:27| I'll have a problem with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=267)|
| 0:04:29| Would you speak into the microphone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=269)|
| 0:04:31| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=271)|
| 0:04:32| I'll have a problem with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=272)|
| 0:04:33| Why don't you tell us about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=273)|
| 0:04:35| I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=275)|
| 0:04:36| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=276)|
| 0:04:37| Ms. Garcia, if you'd let Mr. Minus speak there for a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=277)|
| 0:04:41| Mr. Chairman, this place is located right next door to a daycare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=281)|
| 0:04:48| In a Tennessee state law, don't say anything about a daycare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=288)|
| 0:04:54| It says churches, schools, a public gathering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=294)|
| 0:04:59| There's 70 children in that daycare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=299)|
| 0:05:02| In my way of thinking, that considers a public gathering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=302)|
| 0:05:09| Anything else, Mr. Minus?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=309)|
| 0:05:10| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=310)|
| 0:05:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=311)|
| 0:05:12| Mr. Owings, you're going to run down the list here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=312)|
| 0:05:17| Codes, do you have a problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=317)|
| 0:05:19| Ending Board of Zoning Appeals meeting Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=319)|
| 0:05:23| Where, Ms. Garcia, you are going to appear at VCA this Wednesday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=323)|
| 0:05:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=329)|
| 0:05:30| And you're requesting a variance, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=330)|
| 0:05:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=332)|
| 0:05:34| From 500 feet to what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=334)|
| 0:05:36| To 100 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=336)|
| 0:05:37| How many?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=337)|
| 0:05:38| 100 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=338)|
| 0:05:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=340)|
| 0:05:42| Fire Marshal, do you have any issues with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=342)|
| 0:05:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=346)|
| 0:05:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=352)|
| 0:05:55| Mr. Leuthold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=355)|
| 0:05:56| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=356)|
| 0:05:57| Make a motion we postpone this until the VCA has a chance to grant or not to grant the variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=357)|
| 0:06:05| Is there a second to that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=365)|
| 0:06:07| Next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=367)|
| 0:06:10| Is there a second to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=370)|
| 0:06:11| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=371)|
| 0:06:13| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=373)|
| 0:06:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=374)|
| 0:06:15| The motion, Ms. Garcia, that's in front of us right now is to postpone this item in front of the beer board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=375)|
| 0:06:21| until you finish up with the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=381)|
| 0:06:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=383)|
| 0:06:24| And if they grant you that variance, then you can come back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=384)|
| 0:06:27| And my belief, but with no certainty, is that you'd probably be granted your license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=387)|
| 0:06:32| But the motion asks that you get that done before we finish up with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=392)|
| 0:06:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=396)|
| 0:06:37| Now, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=397)|
| 0:06:39| Do you have anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=399)|
| 0:06:40| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=400)|
| 0:06:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=401)|
| 0:06:42| Mr. Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=402)|
| 0:06:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=403)|
| 0:06:44| I want to ask the law director, can the VCA give them a variance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=404)|
| 0:06:48| I mean, this location is right next door to a daycare center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=408)|
| 0:06:54| And actually, the front of this restaurant is, in fact, Mr. Minot has pictures of the school bus right in front of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=414)|
| 0:07:04| restaurant where they're loading and unloading children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=424)|
| 0:07:06| And I'm just wondering, can the VCA grant a variance in that situation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=426)|
| 0:07:12| VCA has the authority to grant variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=432)|
| 0:07:15| If this location meets the criteria before the VCA, then they may grant the variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=435)|
| 0:07:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=443)|
| 0:07:24| It will be up to that body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=444)|
| 0:07:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=446)|
| 0:07:27| If we deny this today, will they have the opportunity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=447)|
| 0:07:31| If we deny this today and then they get the variance, can they reapply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=451)|
| 0:07:36| or are they barred from reapplying for a length of time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=456)|
| 0:07:38| What we're doing, I think the motion on the floor is to postpone it until they come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=458)|
| 0:07:42| That's not to say that if you wanted to make a substitute motion to deny, I mean, that's certainly your option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=462)|
| 0:07:47| Well, if I make the substitute motion to deny and then they get their approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=467)|
| 0:07:52| will they be allowed to come back before this board based on the new information?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=472)|
| 0:07:59| We've got a rule that's either 90 days or a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=479)|
| 0:08:02| I'm not sure which that prohibits them from coming back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=482)|
| 0:08:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=485)|
| 0:08:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=486)|
| 0:08:07| I'm going to bring the substitute motion that we deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=487)|
| 0:08:09| And I do want to say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=489)|
| 0:08:10| These are fine folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=490)|
| 0:08:12| They run their restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=492)|
| 0:08:13| Their food is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=493)|
| 0:08:15| I think some family members have other restaurants of similar name throughout town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=495)|
| 0:08:21| So it's not a reflection on you whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=501)|
| 0:08:24| It's just that and I'm very friendly toward beer and alcohol sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=504)|
| 0:08:30| It's just that I don't necessarily believe that we should have a restaurant serving alcohol in the very parking lot that a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=510)|
| 0:08:39| school bus is picking up small children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=519)|
| 0:08:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=522)|
| 0:08:43| The motion, the substitute motion, is to deny the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=523)|
| 0:08:48| Is there a second to that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=528)|
| 0:08:51| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=531)|
| 0:08:52| Seconded by Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=532)|
| 0:08:54| Is there a discussion on the substitute motion to deny?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=534)|
| 0:08:58| Now, Ms. Garcia, if this motion passes and we've effectively said no reason to go to BZA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=538)|
| 0:09:04| unless you just want the exercise, let's vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=544)|
| 0:09:09| I'm going to ask the clerk to call the roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=549)|
| 0:09:10| If you're in favor of denying the vote, the license, you'll vote yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=550)|
| 0:09:14| If you're not at this point, you'll vote no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=554)|
| 0:09:16| Mr. Chairman, may I ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=556)|
| 0:09:17| I'm sorry, Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=557)|
| 0:09:18| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=558)|
| 0:09:19| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=559)|
| 0:09:20| I want to ask the applicant the reason that you're asking for this variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=560)|
| 0:09:22| Is it because of the daycare center next door, 500 feet to 100 feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=562)|
| 0:09:25| Is that the reason you're asking for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=565)|
| 0:09:27| Well, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=567)|
| 0:09:28| They told me that they needed to know how far it was from the building to the property zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=568)|
| 0:09:34| So that's really all I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=574)|
| 0:09:36| I don't know anything about it being because of the daycare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=576)|
| 0:09:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=579)|
| 0:09:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=580)|
| 0:09:41| Once again, we're ready to vote, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=581)|
| 0:09:42| If you're ready to deny this license, this application, you'll vote yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=582)|
| 0:09:47| If at this time you're not, you'll vote no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=587)|
| 0:09:49| Madam Clerk, will you please call the roll?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=589)|
| 0:09:51| Commissioner Greene?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=591)|
| 0:09:52| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=592)|
| 0:09:53| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=593)|
| 0:09:55| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=595)|
| 0:09:56| Commissioner Strickland?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=596)|
| 0:09:57| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=597)|
| 0:09:58| Commissioner Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=598)|
| 0:09:59| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=599)|
| 0:10:00| Commissioner Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=600)|
| 0:10:02| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=602)|
| 0:10:03| Commissioner Luthold?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=603)|
| 0:10:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=604)|
| 0:10:05| Commissioner Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=605)|
| 0:10:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=606)|
| 0:10:07| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=607)|
| 0:10:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=608)|
| 0:10:09| Does any member of the Beer Board wish to change his vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=609)|
| 0:10:15| Chair rules that that motion fails on a final tally of three ayes and five noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=615)|
| 0:10:21| Now we're back to the main motion, which is to delay this application until next month's meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=621)|
| 0:10:26| so that Ms. Garcia can make her case before the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=626)|
| 0:10:30| Is there discussion on the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=630)|
| 0:10:32| Let's vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=632)|
| 0:10:33| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=633)|
| 0:10:34| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=634)|
| 0:10:35| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=635)|
| 0:10:36| It's unanimous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=636)|
| 0:10:37| We'll see you next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=637)|
| 0:10:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=638)|
| 0:10:39| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=639)|
| 0:10:40| All right, Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=640)|
| 0:10:43| This is consideration of suspension revocation of the bill permit for Junior's Family BP at 1707 East Raccoon Valley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=643)|
| 0:10:51| Arthur McKinney III is the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=651)|
| 0:10:56| Do we know what offense this is, first, second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=656)|
| 0:10:59| Let me see if we've got somebody representing Junior's Family BP in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=659)|
| 0:11:04| If you did come, the law director is going to ask you to raise your right hand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=664)|
| 0:11:10| and swear the statements you're about to make are true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=670)|
| 0:11:13| Sir, do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=673)|
| 0:11:16| so help you God through your testimony here today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=676)|
| 0:11:18| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=678)|
| 0:11:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=679)|
| 0:11:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=680)|
| 0:11:21| Do you want to ask your question, Craig, or do you want to wait just a second and get the sheriff's report?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=681)|
| 0:11:24| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=684)|
| 0:11:26| Lieutenant Roman, will you give us your report, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=686)|
| 0:11:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=689)|
| 0:11:30| On May the 18th, 2006, a citation was issued to Jennifer Orr for the sale of an alcohol beverage to an underage employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=690)|
| 0:11:40| of the Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=700)|
| 0:11:47| I'm sorry, sir, I didn't catch your last name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=707)|
| 0:11:49| Would you tell me again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=709)|
| 0:11:50| Arthur McKinney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=710)|
| 0:11:51| McKinney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=711)|
| 0:11:52| Mr. McKinney, what's your reaction to what the lieutenant said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=712)|
| 0:11:55| Do you agree that that happened or do you instead want to argue that point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=715)|
| 0:11:59| Oh, no, it happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=719)|
| 0:12:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=720)|
| 0:12:01| Mr. Leuthold, do you want to ask that question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=721)|
| 0:12:05| Does anybody here know if this is his first offense, second, third?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=725)|
| 0:12:10| Do we know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=730)|
| 0:12:12| I don't know if U.K. or the Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=732)|
| 0:12:16| It's first offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=736)|
| 0:12:18| Then by rule I say we give this establishment either a $500 fine or a 30-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=738)|
| 0:12:28| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=748)|
| 0:12:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=749)|
| 0:12:30| We have a motion that if passes, Mr. McKinney, we'll give you a choice to either pay a $500 fine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=750)|
| 0:12:35| or ceasing beer sales for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=755)|
| 0:12:38| That's what's in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=758)|
| 0:12:39| Do you have any questions about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=759)|
| 0:12:40| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=760)|
| 0:12:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=761)|
| 0:12:42| Mr. Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=762)|
| 0:12:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=763)|
| 0:12:44| Yes, I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=764)|
| 0:12:45| I seem to recall reading over the notes in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=765)|
| 0:12:47| What was the beverage in question that your employee sold to the person?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=767)|
| 0:12:53| It was beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=773)|
| 0:12:54| Was it a beer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=774)|
| 0:12:55| It was a beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=775)|
| 0:12:56| I was thinking it was one of those new alcoholic energy drinks that someone might confuse for a non-alcoholic beverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=776)|
| 0:13:06| Was that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=786)|
| 0:13:07| From what I understand, it was just a single beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=787)|
| 0:13:09| It was just a single, an actual beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=789)|
| 0:13:11| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=791)|
| 0:13:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=792)|
| 0:13:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=795)|
| 0:13:16| We're ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=796)|
| 0:13:17| You've heard the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=797)|
| 0:13:18| 30 days or $500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=798)|
| 0:13:20| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=800)|
| 0:13:22| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=802)|
| 0:13:23| Those opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=803)|
| 0:13:25| Thank you, Mr. McKinney, for coming down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=805)|
| 0:13:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=807)|
| 0:13:28| We have one item on our agenda, a discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=808)|
| 0:13:31| And, frankly, the law director has asked that we postpone this for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=811)|
| 0:13:35| Is there any real heartburn about that request?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=815)|
| 0:13:39| Mr. Schmidt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=819)|
| 0:13:40| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=820)|
| 0:13:41| Formally that we postpone this for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=821)|
| 0:13:43| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=823)|
| 0:13:44| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=824)|
| 0:13:45| Second by Mr. Leuthold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=825)|
| 0:13:46| Any discussion on the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=826)|
| 0:13:47| Hearing none, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=827)|
| 0:13:49| Those opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=829)|
| 0:13:50| It's unanimous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=830)|
| 0:13:51| Any other businesses come before the beer board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=831)|
| 0:13:53| Mr. Minan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=833)|
| 0:13:54| The calendars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=834)|
| 0:13:55| Do you want to make a motion we buy them or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=835)|
| 0:13:58| Have you got us a quote on them yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=838)|
| 0:14:02| Honest, Commissioner, I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=842)|
| 0:14:03| I just thought of it as it came up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=843)|
| 0:14:06| You're trying to get a lot done as soon as you can?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=846)|
| 0:14:08| Is that what's on your mind?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=848)|
| 0:14:10| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=850)|
| 0:14:11| Joe in the office said I need to go ahead and mention it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=851)|
| 0:14:15| We can wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=855)|
| 0:14:16| Do you remember what it was last year, UK?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=856)|
| 0:14:18| It was over $1,200.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=858)|
| 0:14:20| And for those new on the beer board, Mr. Minan, one of his responsibilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=860)|
| 0:14:23| we've made a responsibility to visit every license holder on more than an occasional basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=863)|
| 0:14:30| And one of those trips he takes a calendar out to each of the vendors stating you can't buy beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=870)|
| 0:14:37| if you were born before this date type of calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=877)|
| 0:14:39| And it's been very effective and well received in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=879)|
| 0:14:43| If anyone would care to make a motion that we authorize expending up to, say, it was $1,200 last year, $1,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=883)|
| 0:14:51| Make a motion we authorize UK to purchase calendars to distribute up to $1,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=891)|
| 0:14:57| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=897)|
| 0:14:58| I've got a second by Mr. Schmidt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=898)|
| 0:15:00| Any discussion on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=900)|
| 0:15:01| It's a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=901)|
| 0:15:02| It's a good reason for UK to be out there visiting these vendors as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=902)|
| 0:15:05| Let's vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=905)|

| 0:15:09| It's unanimous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=909)|
| 0:15:10| Anything else, Mr. Minan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=910)|

| 0:16:03| This month's devotional will be by Commissioner Mark Kaywood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=963)|
| 0:16:07| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=967)|
| 0:16:09| It is really a pleasure today to have a dear friend here to do the devotional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=969)|
| 0:16:15| He's one of our graduates of the East Tennessee School of Preaching and Missions at the Carnes Church of Christ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=975)|
| 0:16:21| Now, this gentleman is getting ready to go back to Thailand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=981)|
| 0:16:25| He's from Thailand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=985)|
| 0:16:27| And when he came over here, he had to learn English first before he could take any of the classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=987)|
| 0:16:32| And he is a remarkable student, pretty much a straight-A student for two years at the School of Preaching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=992)|
| 0:16:39| And Samrit, would you come to the phone and name us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=999)|
| 0:16:41| Samrit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1001)|
| 0:16:42| And I'll let him pronounce his last name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1002)|
| 0:16:45| And he just wants to briefly tell you how he's enjoyed his visit over here in America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1005)|
| 0:16:51| and how much he appreciates being up here today to lead us in this devotional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1011)|
| 0:17:02| It is my joy to be here with you this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1022)|
| 0:17:06| My name is Samrit Gammanee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1026)|
| 0:17:08| I'm from Thailand, a small country in Southeast Asia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1028)|
| 0:17:14| I'm blessed to be here in this great nation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1034)|
| 0:17:18| Coming to America and attending preaching school was my dream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1038)|
| 0:17:24| And my dream became true by great blessing of our Lord and his guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1044)|
| 0:17:32| I've been here in the States for almost three years, and I love America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1052)|
| 0:17:38| I came and attended the East Tennessee School of Preaching and Missions in Knoxville, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1058)|
| 0:17:45| in February 2005, and I have completed the course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1065)|
| 0:17:52| I'm so thankful to God for a great hospitality from his children, brothers and sisters in Christ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1072)|
| 0:18:05| I'm away from home, but any time I have been around with brethren in the church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1085)|
| 0:18:11| it makes me feel like home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1091)|
| 0:18:14| I love America and appreciate its people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1094)|
| 0:18:19| I'm going to return to Thailand the 29th of this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1099)|
| 0:18:24| My plan for the Lord soon after I got back home is preaching the gospel of Christ to my nation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1104)|
| 0:18:33| I plan to establish the congregations in northeastern of Thailand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1113)|
| 0:18:38| bring as many as lost souls to our Lord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1118)|
| 0:18:44| Thailand today has about 62 million people, and about 95 percent belongs to Buddhism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1124)|
| 0:18:54| There's lots of work for our Lord needs to be done in that nation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1134)|
| 0:19:00| I ask you, if you will, please pray for us, please pray for me for our work, the Lord's work in Thailand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1140)|
| 0:19:08| Could you bow with me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1148)|
| 0:19:12| Heavenly Father, we come before you these times giving you thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1152)|
| 0:19:18| We are so thankful for our wives and so many blessings you have given to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1158)|

| 0:19:40| Help us to remember and count your blessings and learn to be thankful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1180)|
| 0:19:46| We pray that you will help us to walk in your way, live our lives every day close to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1186)|
| 0:19:52| Lord, we are so thankful for our nations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1192)|
| 0:19:56| We pray for peace and love will be retained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1196)|
| 0:20:00| We pray for the nations around the world, pray for the leaders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1200)|
| 0:20:06| that they will lead the nations into the right way according to your will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1206)|
| 0:20:12| Pray that the gospel will be brought out to people everywhere throughout the world, that your name will be glorified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1212)|
| 0:20:20| Lord, forgive us our sins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1220)|
| 0:20:22| In Jesus' name we pray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1222)|

| 0:20:32| Let's stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1232)|
| 0:20:35| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1235)|
| 0:20:40| and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1240)|
| 0:20:45| indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1245)|
| 0:20:49| Play ball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1249)|
| 0:20:51| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1251)|
| 0:20:53| Commissioner Greese.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1253)|
| 0:20:55| Are you under amendments to the agenda, Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1255)|
| 0:20:57| That's where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1257)|
| 0:20:58| I'd like to first move that all items that are listed to be added be added| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1258)|
| 0:21:01| and those to be deferred be deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1261)|
| 0:21:06| Do we have any objections?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1266)|
| 0:21:10| Commissioner Greese.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1270)|
| 0:21:11| Is that accomplished?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1271)|
| 0:21:13| Well, I don't see any objections, and I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1273)|
| 0:21:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1276)|
| 0:21:17| So that's accomplished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1277)|
| 0:21:21| Secondly, I'd like to move Resolution 907, which is listed on page 13,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1281)|
| 0:21:27| and ask that it be heard before Resolution 906, which is also on page 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1287)|
| 0:21:34| Do we have any objections to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1294)|
| 0:21:37| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1297)|

| 0:21:39| Can we hear them together?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1299)|
| 0:21:40| Well, if the first one, if 907 fails, then we're clearly on to 906.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1300)|
| 0:21:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1306)|
| 0:21:47| We have no objections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1307)|
| 0:21:48| We'll hear 907 before we hear 906.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1308)|
| 0:21:52| Do we have any other amendments to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1312)|

| 0:22:39| The agenda is set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1359)|
| 0:22:40| Clark, I guess we're on consent items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1360)|
| 0:22:41| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1361)|

| 0:28:43| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1723)|
| 0:28:44| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1724)|
| 0:28:45| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1725)|
| 0:28:46| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1726)|
| 0:28:47| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1727)|

| 0:28:49| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1729)|
| 0:28:50| We're on drives and roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1730)|
| 0:28:53| Consideration of closure of Section East Raccoon Valley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1733)|
| 0:28:57| Property is located off Norris Freeway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1737)|
| 0:28:59| And Knox County is the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1739)|
| 0:29:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1742)|
| 0:29:03| That's out in the 7th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1743)|
| 0:29:06| I've talked to Bruce Weitrick over the last couple of days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1746)|
| 0:29:09| Bruce, you want to say anything on this matter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1749)|
| 0:29:14| Recommend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1754)|
| 0:29:15| I want to keep it open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1755)|
| 0:29:20| Bruce Weitrick, Director of Engineering and Public Works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1760)|
| 0:29:23| This was a section of road that was requested by some residents for us to close due to safety concerns out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1763)|
| 0:29:28| at the intersection of Norris Freeway and Raccoon Valley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1768)|
| 0:29:32| We researched the intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1772)|
| 0:29:34| Although it does not rise to the occasion that we typically would do a capital project for an improvement out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1774)|
| 0:29:40| there has been about three or four accidents that we've been able to ascertain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1780)|
| 0:29:44| We're not able to get all the accident records there because part of that road is a state road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1784)|
| 0:29:48| and so the Tennessee Highway Patrol controls those accidents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1788)|
| 0:29:51| So we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1791)|
| 0:29:52| You all closed it on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1792)|
| 0:29:54| We went out there and put up barricades out there since that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1794)|
| 0:29:58| And in doing so, we did that deliberately because there's really no way for us to ascertain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1798)|
| 0:30:03| what the traffic patterns are out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1803)|
| 0:30:06| Since we've done that, we've almost created a different type of safety issue by shutting this down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1806)|
| 0:30:12| It's now shifted to traffic patterns out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1812)|
| 0:30:15| So quite frankly, I don't necessarily believe it is a good idea to actually close this road permanently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1815)|
| 0:30:22| Bruce, is there some way, I think, if you come off of Norris Freeway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1822)|
| 0:30:26| when you take a left onto Old Raccoon Valley, can we put some guardrails in that curve on both sides?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1826)|
| 0:30:34| I think that right there would probably eliminate a lot of concerns from people who live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1834)|
| 0:30:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1838)|
| 0:30:39| I'll have our staff look and see whether a guardrail would be appropriate in that particular curve there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1839)|
| 0:30:44| We can also look at additional signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1844)|
| 0:30:46| But as I stated previously, there isn't a serious accident or problem that would rise it to the occasion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1846)|
| 0:30:52| where I would need to go into a full-blown capital project to correct what's going on out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1852)|
| 0:30:56| So, like I said, we did close it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1856)|
| 0:30:58| But in doing so, we have shifted traffic patterns somewhat and actually created some other issues out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1858)|
| 0:31:04| So I don't know that necessarily we've accomplished anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1864)|
| 0:31:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1868)|
| 0:31:09| Just for the other commissioners, this is a short road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1869)|
| 0:31:12| Bruce, how long is this road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1872)|
| 0:31:14| I know it's pretty short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1874)|
| 0:31:15| You know, I'm thinking maybe it's a quarter of a mile at most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1875)|
| 0:31:19| You're absolutely right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1879)|
| 0:31:20| It is a short road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1880)|
| 0:31:21| I just can't recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1881)|
| 0:31:22| Two thousand feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1882)|
| 0:31:23| Two thousand feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1883)|
| 0:31:24| And I think we've got some people here wanting to speak in favor of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1884)|
| 0:31:27| Do we have anybody that's here opposed to us keeping it open?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1887)|
| 0:31:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1895)|
| 0:31:36| I don't see anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1896)|
| 0:31:37| Clarification, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1897)|
| 0:31:38| Is the proposal to close it or to open it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1898)|
| 0:31:42| The resolution on our agenda is to close it on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1902)|
| 0:31:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1908)|
| 0:31:49| You're against it, ma'am?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1909)|
| 0:31:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1911)|
| 0:31:52| Would you like to come down to the podium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1912)|
| 0:31:53| I'd like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1913)|
| 0:31:57| I know there's several people here today in support of keeping it open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1917)|
| 0:32:02| But maybe if we could just have one person speak against it and one for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1922)|

| 0:32:07| I'm Agnes Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1927)|
| 0:32:08| I live at 3303 Raccoon Valley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1928)|
| 0:32:11| I live right in the corner of Raccoon Valley Road, Raccoon Valley Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1931)|
| 0:32:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1934)|
| 0:32:15| My fence has been torn down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1935)|
| 0:32:17| My water meter has been dug out of the ground by cars coming through fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1937)|
| 0:32:22| And the road signs won't do any good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1942)|
| 0:32:24| They don't do any good on Raccoon Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1944)|
| 0:32:26| On the main road, there's a 45-mile speed limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1946)|
| 0:32:30| You go down there, I'll give you $100 for every one car you go 45 miles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1950)|
| 0:32:35| They go 70, 80.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1955)|
| 0:32:38| And I live, I guess, in the most dangerous part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1958)|
| 0:32:41| It might be bad on the curve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1961)|
| 0:32:43| But where I live, when they turn on, turn left onto Raccoon Valley Drive, nobody slows down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1963)|
| 0:32:50| I can't go to the mailbox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1970)|
| 0:32:51| My husband is disabled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1971)|
| 0:32:53| He can't get out and do anything in the yard by the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1973)|
| 0:32:57| So I think it should be kept closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1977)|
| 0:32:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1979)|
| 0:33:00| Do you live right there in the S curve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1980)|
| 0:33:01| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1981)|
| 0:33:02| Right when you come out of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1982)|
| 0:33:03| Right in the corner of Raccoon Valley Drive and Raccoon Valley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1983)|
| 0:33:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1986)|
| 0:33:07| Got exactly where you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1987)|
| 0:33:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1988)|
| 0:33:09| Now do we have somebody that's in favor of keeping it open?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1989)|
| 0:33:13| If you'll give your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1993)|
| 0:33:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1995)|
| 0:33:16| My name is Jeffrey Corthell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1996)|
| 0:33:17| I live at 5102 East Raccoon Valley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=1997)|
| 0:33:20| It's east of this Norris Freeway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2000)|
| 0:33:24| I represent 76 people that I have contacted who signed a petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2004)|
| 0:33:31| There's also other petitions that Mr. Roger Walsh has circulated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2011)|
| 0:33:37| And I believe those have been emailed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2017)|
| 0:33:39| So we've got close to 300 names of people who would like to open this road back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2019)|
| 0:33:44| There's several reasons I'd like to see it opened up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2024)|
| 0:33:47| Number one is those of us that live east of there, we have to now, with the road closed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2027)|
| 0:33:55| we have to make a left turn onto Norris Freeway where you've got a big curve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2035)|
| 0:34:01| You don't have limited visibility in either direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2041)|
| 0:34:04| And it's a very perilous turn to say the least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2044)|
| 0:34:08| When the road was open, we could take a right turn and then later a left turn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2048)|
| 0:34:12| onto Raccoon Valley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2052)|
| 0:34:13| We'd only have to worry about traffic in one direction, not two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2053)|
| 0:34:17| And since December, I've been hit almost two or three times, almost weekly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2057)|
| 0:34:22| making a left turn on Norris Freeway, people coming down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2062)|
| 0:34:25| I've never had even a close call in the six years that I've lived there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2065)|
| 0:34:29| when the road was open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2069)|
| 0:34:32| Also, I'd like to point out that this two-thirds to three-quarters of a mile detour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2072)|
| 0:34:39| that equates to a lot of miles driven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2079)|
| 0:34:42| For every 100 people that use this road regularly, that increases our mileage driven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2082)|
| 0:34:48| about 33,000 miles, 1,600, 1,700 gallons of gas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2088)|
| 0:34:53| If you say 300 people use this on a daily basis, you're talking 100,000 miles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2093)|
| 0:34:59| 5,000 gallons of gas used, pollution, and additional danger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2099)|
| 0:35:04| I also found out in my discussions with some of the residents just north of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2104)|
| 0:35:09| intersection that the high school fire department provides the primary fire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2109)|
| 0:35:14| and EMS support to some area residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2114)|
| 0:35:18| And some people there are concerned that a five-minute detour could have a serious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2118)|
| 0:35:22| impact if their house is burning down or if they have a heart attack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2122)|
| 0:35:26| And I don't believe any of these things were considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2126)|
| 0:35:30| Also, there was very little notification for those of us that live out in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2130)|
| 0:35:34| that this road was going to be closed permanently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2134)|
| 0:35:38| Personally, when I saw the barricades, I thought they were going to do utility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2138)|
| 0:35:42| water main construction, or something there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2142)|
| 0:35:44| And so it was, what, a week, 10 days ago when I finally called and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2144)|
| 0:35:47| why haven't they started to work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2147)|
| 0:35:49| And I found out that it was going to be closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2149)|
| 0:35:53| The reason that the engineering department told me it was going to be closed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2153)|
| 0:35:56| is the residents were concerned because they were getting mailbox vandalism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2156)|
| 0:36:01| I asked them about accidents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2161)|
| 0:36:02| They said, this is not a high accident area, and they couldn't come up with any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2162)|
| 0:36:06| recent accidents of anything serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2166)|
| 0:36:10| So on behalf of about 300 people, we'd like to see this road back open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2170)|
| 0:36:15| And just as an aside, talking about safety, I live just east of Andersonville Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2175)|
| 0:36:21| an area of Raccoon Valley Road that the sheriff's department calls the Speedway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2181)|
| 0:36:25| You can guess why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2185)|
| 0:36:27| In the six years I've lived there, there have been four fatalities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2187)|
| 0:36:30| within a mile of my house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2190)|
| 0:36:32| There have been numerous accidents and crashes all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2192)|
| 0:36:38| Mailboxes, you can't put up a new mailbox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2198)|
| 0:36:40| The vandals hit it, weak at the most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2200)|
| 0:36:43| I did three until I finally realized you can't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2203)|
| 0:36:45| You just take a hammer, you keep it as ugly as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2205)|
| 0:36:48| and the vandals leave it alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2208)|
| 0:36:50| If you're going to start closing roads because of mailbox vandalism,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2210)|
| 0:36:54| then we'd like to be next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2214)|
| 0:36:56| You can close a hill road and route the traffic around there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2216)|
| 0:36:59| and then, you know, at least you'd have an area that has had a lot of accidents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2219)|
| 0:37:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2223)|
| 0:37:04| Sir, your time is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2224)|
| 0:37:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2225)|
| 0:37:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2226)|
| 0:37:07| Please open it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2227)|
| 0:37:09| This is out in the 7th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2229)|
| 0:37:11| I'll let Commissioner Smith go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2231)|
| 0:37:13| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2233)|
| 0:37:16| Scott Moore and I went out there and met with individuals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2236)|
| 0:37:18| and Bruce, we were talking with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2238)|
| 0:37:20| He's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2240)|
| 0:37:21| We'd like to see some guardrails put in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2241)|
| 0:37:23| and then those directional signs that you put real close to each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2243)|
| 0:37:27| A gentleman was talking about the wrecks and stuff are out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2247)|
| 0:37:29| and it's not reported.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2249)|
| 0:37:31| Well, that's really not in defense for this layout here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2251)|
| 0:37:33| That's really not true because they're going to ditch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2253)|
| 0:37:35| and then they're pulling themselves back out or just, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2255)|
| 0:37:37| have a wreck or something before the police get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2257)|
| 0:37:39| But from all the calls and stuff that I'm getting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2259)|
| 0:37:41| I thank Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2261)|
| 0:37:43| We're going to help more people if we keep this road open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2263)|
| 0:37:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2267)|
| 0:37:48| Yes, I'm in favor of keeping it open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2268)|
| 0:37:49| but also we need a positive vote out of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2269)|
| 0:37:51| So I'm going to make a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2271)|
| 0:37:53| Do you want me to make it for you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2273)|
| 0:37:55| You can go ahead and make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2275)|
| 0:37:56| I mean, to keep you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2276)|
| 0:37:57| Then you can vote the way you want to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2277)|
| 0:37:58| but just to get it on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2278)|
| 0:37:59| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2279)|
| 0:38:00| I'd move that this procedural service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2280)|
| 0:38:02| so don't panic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2282)|
| 0:38:03| but I would move that East Raccoon Valley on the second reading be voted to close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2283)|
| 0:38:10| To close?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2290)|
| 0:38:11| No, I think we need to vote to open it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2291)|
| 0:38:13| It's not closed yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2293)|
| 0:38:15| Well, leave it alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2295)|
| 0:38:16| Just withdraw it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2296)|
| 0:38:17| Oh, you're not wanting it closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2297)|
| 0:38:19| Well, if you vote on my motion and it fails and it does the same thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2299)|
| 0:38:22| that way you have a positive motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2302)|
| 0:38:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2305)|
| 0:38:26| It's not closed yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2306)|
| 0:38:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2307)|
| 0:38:28| So your motion is to close it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2308)|
| 0:38:29| To close it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2309)|
| 0:38:31| And do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2311)|
| 0:38:33| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2313)|
| 0:38:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2314)|
| 0:38:35| It's properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2315)|
| 0:38:37| A yes vote would mean close it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2317)|
| 0:38:39| A no vote would mean open it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2319)|
| 0:38:42| And I think Commissioner Smith and myself both think it's better to serve the citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2322)|
| 0:38:47| of the 7th District if we leave it open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2327)|
| 0:38:50| with Mr. Weitrick going out there and looking at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2330)|
| 0:38:53| Voice vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2333)|
| 0:38:54| So voice vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2334)|
| 0:38:55| So all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2335)|
| 0:38:57| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2337)|
| 0:38:58| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2338)|
| 0:38:59| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2339)|
| 0:39:00| And the Chair rules that the no votes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2340)|
| 0:39:04| Who voted yes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2344)|
| 0:39:07| I mean, we might need that for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2347)|
| 0:39:09| Commissioner Pinkston, I think, was the only one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2349)|
| 0:39:11| He doesn't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2351)|
| 0:39:14| Ask him if he wishes to change his vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2354)|

| 0:39:50| Whereas, Ann Redman began working for the Knox County Library System on September the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2390)|
| 0:39:55| 23rd, 1974, and retired in November of 2006, after having served her community for more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2395)|
| 0:40:02| than 32 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2402)|
| 0:40:03| And whereas, during her tenure with Knox County, she has made a substantial impact on those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2403)|
| 0:40:08| around her, influencing her peers to strive for excellence in their lives and careers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2408)|
| 0:40:13| And whereas, Ms. Redman, who began working for the West Knoxville Branch Library, has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2413)|
| 0:40:17| worked as a reader's advisor, providing help or assistance to many different library patrons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2417)|
| 0:40:23| And whereas, Ms. Redman has worked not only to strengthen and improve her workplace, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2423)|
| 0:40:28| her community as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2428)|
| 0:40:30| Now, therefore, be it resolved by the Commission of Knox County as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2430)|
| 0:40:35| The Knox County Commission, on behalf of all the citizens of Knox County, wishes to honor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2435)|
| 0:40:39| Ann Redman upon the occasion of her retirement from the Knox County Library System, and expresses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2439)|
| 0:40:45| its sincerest appreciation to her for her committed and dedicated public service, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2445)|
| 0:40:51| wishes her happiness and good health as she enjoys her life in retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2451)|
| 0:40:57| I'd just like to say, over the past years, we've been recognizing our library in Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2457)|
| 0:41:01| County as one of the great libraries we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2461)|
| 0:41:04| It's because of people like Ann Redman that's put 32 years into the library system, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2464)|
| 0:41:09| I just felt like we should honor her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2469)|
| 0:41:11| And, of course, she's not able to be here today, but we do have her husband here, Len,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2471)|
| 0:41:15| and if he'd like to say something, he's welcome to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2475)|
| 0:41:20| Ann Redman sends her thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2480)|
| 0:41:22| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2482)|
| 0:41:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2483)|
| 0:41:28| Okay, if the Commissioner will give me just a little latitude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2488)|
| 0:41:33| We've got one we need to add for the County Mayor, Billy Stokes' appointment to the Public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2493)|
| 0:41:38| Building Authority, but I need to add that to the agenda, and if we could vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2498)|
| 0:41:43| Well, just go ahead and add it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2503)|
| 0:41:45| If no one objects, we'll add it to the agenda, and if we could go ahead and vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2505)|
| 0:41:52| I'll make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2512)|
| 0:41:53| We'll go ahead and approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2513)|
| 0:41:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2514)|
| 0:41:55| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2515)|
| 0:41:56| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2516)|
| 0:41:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2517)|
| 0:41:58| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2518)|
| 0:41:59| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2519)|
| 0:42:00| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2520)|
| 0:42:01| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2521)|
| 0:42:02| And it's unanimous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2522)|
| 0:42:03| Mayor, Mr. Stokes is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2523)|
| 0:42:07| Mr. Stokes has been active in our community for a long number of years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2527)|
| 0:42:10| and done excellent jobs in a variety of capacities, and I'm delighted that he's willing to accept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2530)|
| 0:42:14| the appointment to the Public Building Authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2534)|
| 0:42:16| Billy, thank you, and I know you'll do a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2536)|
| 0:42:18| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2538)|
| 0:42:19| You understand to pay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2539)|

| 0:42:25| Congratulations, Mr. Stokes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2545)|
| 0:42:27| I look forward to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2547)|
| 0:42:32| Okay, Clerk, I think we're on 905.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2552)|

| 0:43:01| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2581)|
| 0:43:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2582)|
| 0:43:03| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2583)|
| 0:43:04| Commissioner Mark Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2584)|
| 0:43:05| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2585)|
| 0:43:06| The only reason I ask this be taken off the consent agenda is because I am an employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2586)|
| 0:43:10| of the University of Tennessee, and even though I don't perceive any genuine conflict of interest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2590)|
| 0:43:15| even to avoid the appearance of one, I will abstain on this vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2595)|
| 0:43:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2599)|
| 0:43:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2600)|
| 0:43:21| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2601)|
| 0:43:22| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2602)|
| 0:43:23| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2603)|
| 0:43:24| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2604)|
| 0:43:25| And one abstained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2605)|
| 0:43:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2606)|
| 0:43:27| I think we're on 905.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2607)|
| 0:43:30| This is a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee, requesting that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2610)|
| 0:43:39| Public Building Authority reopen the City-County Building parking garage for use by the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2619)|
| 0:43:44| Intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2624)|
| 0:43:45| On a vote of 8-0, we voted to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2625)|
| 0:43:49| Finance Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2629)|
| 0:43:50| Finance voted 8-0 for no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2630)|
| 0:43:53| However, I will move approval to get it on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2633)|
| 0:43:57| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2637)|
| 0:43:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2638)|
| 0:43:59| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2639)|
| 0:44:00| Mayor Ragsdale, you've outlined your plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2640)|
| 0:44:02| Would you like to tell the rest of the public or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2642)|
| 0:44:05| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2645)|
| 0:44:07| We've worked hard for several months to try and identify a plan to make the garage more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2647)|
| 0:44:11| accessible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2651)|
| 0:44:12| This is probably step one in that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2652)|
| 0:44:15| Hopefully, we can do some other things as well, but this would open up a level of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2655)|
| 0:44:19| parking garage that is open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2659)|
| 0:44:21| It's the cantilevered area that extends out above the building to the general public in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2661)|
| 0:44:25| the evening and on weekends, free of charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2665)|
| 0:44:27| That would be, I think, 60 plus additional spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2667)|
| 0:44:31| Mr. Smith of the Public Building Authority has worked with us on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2671)|
| 0:44:35| So, I would hope that that would alleviate some of the problems we have at night with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2675)|
| 0:44:38| people wanting to access our waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2678)|
| 0:44:40| Also, we're working on several other different things to improve access as well, but I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2680)|
| 0:44:44| this is a good first step in making that happen, particularly with those who have establishments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2684)|
| 0:44:48| along the waterfront that they need parking, particularly in the evenings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2688)|
| 0:44:52| Thank you, County Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2692)|
| 0:44:54| Commissioner Greese.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2694)|
| 0:44:55| Just so I'm clear, then, the resolution calls for the entire parking garage to be open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2695)|
| 0:44:59| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2699)|
| 0:45:00| And so I'm going to the maker of the motion to see if the mayor's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2700)|
| 0:45:08| I know you're just the next step because you have to go to PVA, but your recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2708)|
| 0:45:12| based on this resolution is to ask for the parking deck only to be open?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2712)|
| 0:45:17| Commissioner Greese, it's that the exterior deck sits out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2717)|
| 0:45:21| And, yes, it would be open right now in the evenings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2721)|
| 0:45:25| Mayor Haslam is in agreement with this, but we are working on some other things to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2725)|
| 0:45:28| the garage more accessible to our public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2728)|
| 0:45:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2730)|
| 0:45:31| That just conflicts slightly with the resolution, and I just want to make sure that the maker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2731)|
| 0:45:36| of the motion is okay with what you've stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2736)|
| 0:45:38| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2738)|
| 0:45:39| I think I made the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2739)|
| 0:45:40| Do you want to have that amended as your memo here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2740)|
| 0:45:45| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2745)|
| 0:45:46| If we could, that would be, I think, appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2746)|
| 0:45:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2747)|
| 0:45:48| I'll accept that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2748)|
| 0:45:49| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2749)|
| 0:45:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2750)|
| 0:45:51| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2751)|
| 0:45:53| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2753)|
| 0:45:54| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2754)|
| 0:45:55| I want to ask some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2755)|
| 0:45:56| I don't know if the mayor is up for public building authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2756)|
| 0:45:59| Is there anybody here from them who has some questions they would like to ask or some requests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2759)|
| 0:46:07| if we could?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2767)|
| 0:46:09| My name is Bob Browntree, and I'm employed by the Public Building Authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2769)|
| 0:46:13| I live at 221 Mayview Drive in Powell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2773)|
| 0:46:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2776)|
| 0:46:17| Ask the commission office to get me a list of who all is using the garage, and I've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2777)|
| 0:46:23| goodness, 55, 60 pages here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2783)|
| 0:46:26| It looks like about 50 pages or 50 names or so on each page, and that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2786)|
| 0:46:32| How sophisticated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2792)|
| 0:46:34| When we come in and we use these little cars to get in, how far back can you go and read on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2794)|
| 0:46:41| How much research can you guys do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2801)|
| 0:46:44| Commissioner, I'm not sure exactly how far back we can go, but it is several months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2804)|
| 0:46:49| And here's why I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2809)|
| 0:46:50| I was at a meeting last week, and the comment was made of a lady.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2810)|
| 0:46:54| And she said that she knows two friends that are up here that are on some committees up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2814)|
| 0:47:00| and they work downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2820)|
| 0:47:02| And their committee meets quarterly or whatever, but they park here all day long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2822)|
| 0:47:06| Do we, I'm assuming that you know who's on what committees, how often these committees meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2826)|
| 0:47:12| Can we go through here and start culling some of these people that are abusing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2832)|
| 0:47:16| and maybe we can open up some more spaces?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2836)|
| 0:47:19| We have, we quite often survey the use of the cards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2839)|
| 0:47:24| And when we find misuse of an access card, we'll restrict access to it or stop it, pull it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2844)|
| 0:47:32| Because people right now, I mean, we've made the request of you now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2852)|
| 0:47:34| Some people, well, I'll go park somewhere else for a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2854)|
| 0:47:36| But if you can go back and you could report to us who has been using this that you do not think that should be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2856)|
| 0:47:43| and then take that to those appropriate individual, their supervisors or the committees that they're on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2863)|
| 0:47:50| Let's see what we could clean up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2870)|
| 0:47:52| Another thing I'd like to see, if you could possibly do this, is could you give us a list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2872)|
| 0:47:56| let's say two or three block radius of what that costs to park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2876)|
| 0:48:01| If I worked here and I had to, I couldn't get in the parking garage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2881)|
| 0:48:05| what it would cost me to park for a monthly rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2885)|
| 0:48:08| And let's see what we're getting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2888)|
| 0:48:13| Commissioner, I can tell you, as of today, the cost to park at the Riverview Tower is $1 for the first 20 minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2893)|
| 0:48:22| or $10 all day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2902)|
| 0:48:24| The monthly charge is $91.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2904)|
| 0:48:26| Ninety-one dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2906)|
| 0:48:27| It's the same at First Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2907)|
| 0:48:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2910)|
| 0:48:31| So, who sets these rates?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2911)|
| 0:48:33| Is it your department, the public authority that says, all right, we're going to charge $30?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2913)|
| 0:48:36| Or where do you all get your guidance to set the rate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2916)|
| 0:48:40| These rates were set, I know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2920)|
| 0:48:42| more than 12 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2922)|
| 0:48:44| They have not changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2924)|
| 0:48:45| And we receive our guidance from the mayor's offices as to the charges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2925)|
| 0:48:51| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2931)|
| 0:48:52| For monthly parkers, for employees in this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2932)|
| 0:48:55| Well, I'd very much like to see, of this pretty thick list here, who do you all think may be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2935)|
| 0:49:01| and I don't care who they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2941)|
| 0:49:02| I don't even need to know who they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2942)|
| 0:49:04| But if we couldn't get those to the appropriate mayors or whoever needs to be working on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2944)|
| 0:49:09| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2949)|
| 0:49:10| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2950)|
| 0:49:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2951)|
| 0:49:12| Mr. Rountree, I want to say I know you all do a good job at keeping up with those cards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2952)|
| 0:49:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2957)|
| 0:49:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2958)|
| 0:49:19| It's not an easy task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2959)|
| 0:49:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2961)|
| 0:49:22| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2962)|
| 0:49:23| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2963)|
| 0:49:24| What time frame are we looking at to implement this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2964)|
| 0:49:26| I know that there needs to be some capital improvements made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2966)|
| 0:49:29| Commissioner, this program as presented by Mayor Ragsdale would allow the garage to be open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2969)|
| 0:49:35| from 6 to 11 p.m., Monday through Friday, and on weekends until all weekend until 10 p.m. on Sunday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2975)|
| 0:49:43| But as far as when we begin this program, are we looking at a month from now, three months from now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2983)|
| 0:49:48| We have some modest capital improvements we need to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2988)|
| 0:49:53| I see no reason why we couldn't affect these within four to six weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2993)|
| 0:49:59| We've also talked about the need for security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=2999)|
| 0:50:01| So can you assure us that if, indeed, someone pulls in there, that this will be secure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3001)|
| 0:50:08| Absolutely, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3008)|
| 0:50:10| We have a series of closed-circuit television monitors that we keep an eye out, especially in the parking garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3010)|
| 0:50:16| And we have two cameras that are constantly observing this area where people will enter and leave a garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3016)|
| 0:50:23| So you will not have people physically there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3023)|
| 0:50:25| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3025)|
| 0:50:26| You'll be monitoring it through cameras.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3026)|
| 0:50:27| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3027)|
| 0:50:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3028)|
| 0:50:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3029)|
| 0:50:30| Mr. Browntree, do you remember with the engineering controls that we're going to install?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3030)|
| 0:50:36| I just want to say, as we've been dealing with this for, it seems like, a very long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3036)|
| 0:50:42| and I want to thank Mayor Ragsdale, Mayor Haslam, Sheriff Hutchinson, and Chief Owens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3042)|
| 0:50:47| and the rest of the people that served on the committee, because I know Dwight VanderVeet as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3047)|
| 0:50:51| I mean, I think everybody worked hard, and I think we've come to a good first step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3051)|
| 0:50:54| So I hope everyone supports it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3054)|
| 0:50:56| Commissioner Grease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3056)|
| 0:50:58| I remember out there on that cantilevered parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3058)|
| 0:51:00| In the past, there have been family gatherings, religious gatherings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3060)|
| 0:51:05| One of the biggest problems we had there were individuals coming down into that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3065)|
| 0:51:11| and communicating with people in the jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3071)|
| 0:51:14| Showing their families, showing their babies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3074)|
| 0:51:16| Oh, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3076)|
| 0:51:17| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3077)|
| 0:51:18| And that's, I won't say it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3078)|
| 0:51:21| Is that, do you expect that will continue or start up again, or are you set up to not let gatherings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3081)|
| 0:51:27| occur for a long time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3087)|
| 0:51:28| Commissioner, with the cameras that we have there now, we can monitor that very closely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3088)|
| 0:51:34| And some of you all may know that we do have a staff down in the L1 entrance there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3094)|
| 0:51:39| that primarily their job is to observe our closed-circuit TV cameras throughout our properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3099)|
| 0:51:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3107)|
| 0:51:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3108)|
| 0:51:49| Commissioner Goodham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3109)|
| 0:51:50| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3110)|
| 0:51:51| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3111)|
| 0:51:52| Bob, what we've just talked about is a resolution from the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3112)|
| 0:51:58| Do you have to have something similar from the city before you take any action or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3118)|
| 0:52:04| I think Mayor Ragsdale and Mayor Haslam and CEO Dale Smith have all discussed this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3124)|
| 0:52:10| and they're in agreement that this is a reasonable way to solve this problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3130)|
| 0:52:14| Does city council need to address it like the county commission is with you all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3134)|
| 0:52:19| Our PBA board certainly does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3139)|
| 0:52:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3142)|
| 0:52:23| So when does your board meet next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3143)|
| 0:52:24| We meet next, we met two weeks ago, so it is February 15th, 16th, something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3144)|
| 0:52:35| So you've got a couple of weeks before you meet again, three weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3155)|
| 0:52:40| Do you have to have all the capital improvements completed before the deck would be opened up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3160)|
| 0:52:46| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3166)|
| 0:52:47| And you think that could be done in a couple, three weeks as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3167)|
| 0:52:51| Commissioner, that's a pretty tight timetable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3171)|
| 0:52:53| I've got to have some metal fabrication done, which can take some time at these shops, depending on their workload.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3173)|
| 0:53:01| So, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3181)|
| 0:53:03| If we were to say three months, that would be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3183)|
| 0:53:05| No, three months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3185)|
| 0:53:06| I think three months is too many months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3186)|
| 0:53:08| I think one month is not enough months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3188)|
| 0:53:11| So four to six weeks, eight weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3191)|
| 0:53:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3196)|
| 0:53:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3197)|
| 0:53:18| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3198)|
| 0:53:21| When we're going to do this, and I'm glad, you know, this is a start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3201)|
| 0:53:24| And a lot of us, this was a campaign issue that we were going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3204)|
| 0:53:27| Mr. Chairman Moore, have you got some sort of timetable working with them that we're going to give this six months, a year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3207)|
| 0:53:35| I mean, we don't know that this is going to really fix the problem that we need fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3215)|
| 0:53:41| We see that it's not, and there are more people still need to use the courthouse, which I feel that there will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3221)|
| 0:53:47| Do we have a timetable as to how long we might want to give this a try and then move to something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3227)|
| 0:53:51| We're going to rely on public opinion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3231)|
| 0:53:54| What sort of game plan maybe for the mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3234)|
| 0:53:57| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3237)|
| 0:53:58| Commissioner, I think this will take care of the nights and weekends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3238)|
| 0:54:00| I think everybody still wants to work on coming to some kind of solution for people wanting to get in here during business hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3240)|
| 0:54:09| It's going to take us a little more time, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3249)|
| 0:54:10| But I think certainly this takes care of the issue of nights and weekends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3250)|
| 0:54:15| So I'm glad that we're here today getting ready to vote on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3255)|
| 0:54:18| And, Bob, thank you for your work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3258)|
| 0:54:19| You do good work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3259)|
| 0:54:20| And I'd like to see it open completely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3260)|
| 0:54:22| Commissioner Mills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3262)|
| 0:54:24| Yes, I definitely think we're headed in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3264)|
| 0:54:27| And this is the starting point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3267)|
| 0:54:28| And I do appreciate everyone working on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3268)|
| 0:54:31| So, Mr. Chairman, I'll call for the question on the previous motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3271)|
| 0:54:35| Thank you, Commissioner Mills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3275)|
| 0:54:36| I think we've got a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3276)|
| 0:54:37| Would you restate the motion, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3277)|
| 0:54:40| It was amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3280)|
| 0:54:41| And if you would, exactly what we're voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3281)|
| 0:54:44| The motion is, did you get the memo there from the mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3284)|
| 0:54:48| So it's going to reflect the memo from the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3288)|
| 0:54:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3290)|
| 0:54:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3291)|
| 0:54:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3292)|
| 0:54:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3293)|
| 0:54:54| It's been properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3294)|
| 0:54:55| No more discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3295)|
| 0:54:56| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3296)|
| 0:54:57| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3297)|
| 0:54:58| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3298)|
| 0:54:59| And it's unanimous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3299)|
| 0:55:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3300)|
| 0:55:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3301)|
| 0:55:02| We're on 907.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3302)|
| 0:55:03| Consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3303)|
| 0:55:07| calling for a special election to replace the eight commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3307)|
| 0:55:11| and four countywide elected officials affected by the Supreme Court ruling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3311)|
| 0:55:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3317)|
| 0:55:18| Intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3318)|
| 0:55:19| On a vote of nine to zero, we have no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3319)|
| 0:55:23| Finance, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3323)|
| 0:55:24| Finance, by a vote of eight to zero, also had no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3324)|
| 0:55:31| Commissioner Grace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3331)|
| 0:55:32| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3332)|
| 0:55:34| I'm going to make a motion that this resolution be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3334)|
| 0:55:39| And I'll speak to it briefly and may reserve some time to come back if there are questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3339)|
| 0:55:44| But over the last week or so, I've had just an unbelievable number of people calling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3344)|
| 0:55:52| wanting a position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3352)|
| 0:55:53| Let's just start with those phone calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3353)|
| 0:55:55| But perhaps an equal number of people who are just basically aghast at the possibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3355)|
| 0:56:00| that we might just unilaterally and arbitrarily assign whoever the heck we want to without any consideration from the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3360)|
| 0:56:07| And my suggestion is the best consideration we can give the public is to let them vote on replacement candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3367)|
| 0:56:14| Now, that's going to take some help from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3374)|
| 0:56:16| It's nothing the law director has pounded into our head over and over that per-hour charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3376)|
| 0:56:21| We cannot do it unilaterally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3381)|
| 0:56:24| But my motion to call for the special election would have to include asking the state to pass special enabling legislation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3384)|
| 0:56:34| to let us have an interim special election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3394)|
| 0:56:37| And, frankly, I don't care if there's a primary or if it's a winner-take-all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3397)|
| 0:56:40| Anybody who wants to be considered gets on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3400)|
| 0:56:44| And whoever gets the most votes in each of these categories is it for the interim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3404)|
| 0:56:48| That works just fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3408)|
| 0:56:51| But I think we do need to pay some respect to the public and their insistence in my mind that they would like some input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3411)|
| 0:56:56| And to me, this is the fairest, most equitable way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3416)|
| 0:56:59| That's my motion, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3419)|
| 0:57:00| Mr. Chairman, I'll second that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3420)|
| 0:57:03| Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3423)|
| 0:57:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3426)|
| 0:57:07| Can there be some language added to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3427)|
| 0:57:10| We have a meeting called on the 31st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3430)|
| 0:57:13| And I do think based on the number of calls that we've been getting that the public certainly is having lots of input into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3433)|
| 0:57:20| Is there any way we could add some language to this, giving the state a timetable that they react to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3440)|
| 0:57:28| so that this does not throw off their meeting on the 31st?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3448)|
| 0:57:33| Mr. Hall, Director, do you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3453)|
| 0:57:35| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3455)|
| 0:57:36| Now, that's up to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3456)|
| 0:57:37| You can add whatever you wish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3457)|
| 0:57:40| From what I hear Commissioner Greese suggesting is that it contains some language to request our legislative delegation to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3460)|
| 0:57:49| proceed with special legislation for this one instance to provide for a special election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3469)|
| 0:58:00| We will need to add that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3480)|
| 0:58:02| And I think what you're asking for is a new private act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3482)|
| 0:58:06| Well, I don't think there's any question about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3486)|
| 0:58:08| And Commissioner Lambert, if this passes, then in my mind there would be no need for a meeting on the 31st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3488)|
| 0:58:12| I think it would make it moot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3492)|
| 0:58:13| See, that's what I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3493)|
| 0:58:16| I'm getting bombarded with calls on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3496)|
| 0:58:19| I think we need to, you know, we need to just do our job and get it over with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3499)|
| 0:58:24| And if we send a request to the state that we need to have some sort of a timetable on that so that this can't be drug on indefinitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3504)|
| 0:58:36| Well, I suggest to you that that's us telling the state how to do their business is a little bit iffy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3516)|
| 0:58:42| And I think our legislative delegation here in Knox County will get the same number of more calls than we've received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3522)|
| 0:58:48| And I think they'll understand the urgency of it and the importance of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3528)|
| 0:58:51| And I would expect that they would send us a clear message quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3531)|
| 0:58:54| We're not going to handle it or we're going to push as quickly so we can get this election handled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3534)|
| 0:58:58| That would be my hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3538)|
| 0:59:02| Got a lot of lights on, so let's just start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3542)|
| 0:59:05| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3545)|
| 0:59:07| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3547)|
| 0:59:08| I'm one of those who believes that the people should select these replacements rather than the politicians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3548)|
| 0:59:13| But I do have a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3553)|
| 0:59:15| First of all, I understand that the legislature will not go back into session until the 28th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3555)|
| 0:59:20| And I may be iffy on that date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3560)|
| 0:59:22| But you're looking at next week before they even go into session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3562)|
| 0:59:25| I'm not sure how quickly this would go through the legislative process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3565)|
| 0:59:28| I'm not sure if it would need to go through the committee process and then have the Senate and the House| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3568)|
| 0:59:33| or if, indeed, the legislative delegation of Mox County could get together, make a resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3573)|
| 0:59:38| and run it through the General Assembly quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3578)|
| 0:59:41| But a couple of other questions I have, and I see Mr. Greg McKay is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3581)|
| 0:59:44| And if you might indulge me, Mr. McKay, I'd like to ask you a couple of questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3584)|
| 0:59:47| with regards to, again, the time frame that we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3587)|
| 0:59:51| Let's say, for example, legislature goes into session and the first part of February,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3591)|
| 0:59:58| we are able to pass a special act which would allow us to have a special election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3598)|
| 1:00:04| What time frame then would we be looking at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3604)|
| 1:00:06| Would it come back to this body, Mr. Law Director, and we would have to vote on it again to set a date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3606)|
| 1:00:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3611)|
| 1:00:12| And then what time frame are we realistically looking at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3612)|
| 1:00:16| For the record, my name is Greg McKay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3616)|
| 1:00:18| I'm the Administrator of Elections here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3618)|
| 1:00:21| Special elections by legislation occur 75 to 80 days after they're called for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3621)|
| 1:00:27| And for good reason, that's how long it takes to get the qualifying deadline and get everything ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3627)|
| 1:00:32| So if let's just say that the state were to pass something on the 7th of February,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3632)|
| 1:00:37| you'd be looking at a May 1st election, somewhere in that range, assuming you're having a primary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3637)|
| 1:00:42| and then a general sometime the end of July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3642)|
| 1:00:46| We'd have it all done by ready to be sworn in by around August 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3646)|
| 1:00:50| Would we need to give direction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3650)|
| 1:00:51| I'm going back and forth here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3651)|
| 1:00:53| Would we need to give direction to the legislature as to whether we would ask for a special election winner take all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3653)|
| 1:00:58| or a general election followed by or a primary followed by a general election?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3658)|
| 1:01:02| I would think you would want to give whatever direction, you know, you could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3662)|
| 1:01:06| The more direction that you give them, the better the legislation is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3666)|
| 1:01:10| They're only going to write what it is we request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3670)|
| 1:01:14| So be direct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3674)|
| 1:01:17| If we did two elections, May would be the primaries, and then how long would it be before you had the general election?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3677)|
| 1:01:24| You want to schedule at least 60, 65 days after that for the reason that we don't want to disenfranchise the military vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3684)|
| 1:01:32| It takes, we send ballots to our, you know, military people 45 days before each election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3692)|
| 1:01:39| and you certainly don't want to disenfranchise them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3699)|
| 1:01:42| We're looking at July, basically, or maybe August, theoretically, depending on things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3702)|
| 1:01:46| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3706)|
| 1:01:47| Yeah, end of July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3707)|
| 1:01:48| And regardless of what we do here today, there will be an election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3708)|
| 1:01:51| Now, when I say will be an election, there could be an election in February to coincide with the presidential primary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3711)|
| 1:01:56| That would be up to this body to determine if they wanted to utilize that, but since the state pays for it, it would make sense to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3716)|
| 1:02:02| So regardless, if we had an election in May and July, there's going to be an election in February regardless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3722)|
| 1:02:10| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3730)|
| 1:02:11| That's correct, unless the legislator changes it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3731)|
| 1:02:15| So we would be looking at folks having, going to the polls twice in just a matter of months to select these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3735)|
| 1:02:23| And then going back again in February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3743)|
| 1:02:25| Three times in three months, I mean three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3745)|
| 1:02:28| In looking at the time frame, and again, I'm one of those who believes that the people need to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3748)|
| 1:02:33| In looking at the time frame, the time frame is very iffy, particularly given the fact that the legislature is going to need to act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3753)|
| 1:02:40| and we don't really know how the legislature is going to act or how long it's going to act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3760)|
| 1:02:44| I guess my bottom line is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3764)|
| 1:02:46| The folks who are going to receive these appointments, if we go through the appointment process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3766)|
| 1:02:50| they will not have to conduct any fundraisers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3770)|
| 1:02:52| They will not have to knock on any doors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3772)|
| 1:02:54| They will not have to put out any yard signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3774)|
| 1:02:56| They will not have to attend any community meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3776)|
| 1:02:59| They will not have to answer any questions theoretically from the media or any public forums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3779)|
| 1:03:04| And I think that the least we could ask is that we have a public and open process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3784)|
| 1:03:09| where these individuals who want to be considered for this position would at least let their names be known,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3789)|
| 1:03:14| either through our commission office or some public process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3794)|
| 1:03:16| so that the public knows who is interested in these positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3796)|
| 1:03:20| And at that point, submit qualifications if we ask, because I agree with Mr. Lambert,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3800)|
| 1:03:27| we're getting a lot of phone calls, but I don't think that that's the public process that the public is interested in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3807)|
| 1:03:31| I think they want to know who is being considered for these positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3811)|
| 1:03:34| And to me, the very, very least we could ask of them, since they're not going through the campaign process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3814)|
| 1:03:39| is let us know and maybe set a deadline, and I know that we can't do that legally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3819)|
| 1:03:44| but at least set some kind of timetable to say, if you're interested in these positions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3824)|
| 1:03:47| let us know by X number of date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3827)|
| 1:03:49| Then make that public, let people know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3829)|
| 1:03:51| Then they can start giving us informed information as to how they feel about the different candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3831)|
| 1:03:56| Then we can get together and make our appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3836)|
| 1:03:58| So I'm still iffy on your resolution, Mr. Greese.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3838)|
| 1:04:03| Mr. Hammond, I'm happy to amend my resolution to ask the legislature to make it a one-election, winner-take-all contest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3843)|
| 1:04:12| Forget the primaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3852)|
| 1:04:13| That will speed it up 65 to 70 days, according to Mr. McKay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3853)|
| 1:04:17| Is that correct, Mr. McKay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3857)|
| 1:04:19| If we have one election instead of two, we say 70 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3859)|
| 1:04:24| Yeah, if you had one, it would be 75 to 80 days after whenever it was called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3864)|
| 1:04:29| As opposed to then a general following a primary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3869)|
| 1:04:34| So I'm happy if that will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3874)|
| 1:04:36| I'm not for holding this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3876)|
| 1:04:37| I just want the public to make the decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3877)|
| 1:04:39| So I'll amend my motion if the second will agree to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3879)|
| 1:04:42| Second agrees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3882)|
| 1:04:45| Okay, Commissioner Aguda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3885)|
| 1:04:46| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3886)|
| 1:04:50| Realizing that there is a presidential preference primary to be held in February of 2008,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3890)|
| 1:04:59| I believe it could be possible that part of our request of the state would be to let this special election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3899)|
| 1:05:07| fill the unexpired terms or the balance of the terms of these positions that are now available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3907)|
| 1:05:16| And those people would not have to go through another election in February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3916)|
| 1:05:21| Mr. McKay, would you agree to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3921)|
| 1:05:26| In other words, we can say this special election applies for the balance of this term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3926)|
| 1:05:32| And those people would not be subject to going through another primary or general election in 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3932)|
| 1:05:41| You're asking the wrong guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3941)|
| 1:05:43| Well, but it could be done is what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3943)|
| 1:05:45| Do you know of any reason it couldn't be done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3945)|
| 1:05:49| Not right off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3949)|
| 1:05:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3950)|
| 1:05:51| So that would prevent these folks from running for office now and then having to run again in a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3951)|
| 1:06:06| Could we ask that the special election do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3966)|
| 1:06:09| The only reason I hesitate is, Mr. Law Director, did not the Supreme Court say we had to fill until the next general election?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3969)|
| 1:06:18| That is the import of the law and the Constitution that the Supreme Court cites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3978)|
| 1:06:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3983)|
| 1:06:24| That the county legislative body makes the replacements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3984)|
| 1:06:28| The successors hold office until the next countywide general election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3988)|
| 1:06:35| Well, I'm not trying to complicate things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3995)|
| 1:06:37| But I do want to say that I have talked to Senators Woodson and Burchett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=3997)|
| 1:06:43| Both are most receptive to try to help the constituents of Knox County, which are also their constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4003)|
| 1:06:51| And I have been told that if this body requests of them what we're talking about in the form of a resolution, they cannot ignore it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4011)|
| 1:07:02| They would be most happy to take it to the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4022)|
| 1:07:05| They would be most happy to expedite the request of the county commission and have an answer as early as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4025)|
| 1:07:15| How early is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4035)|
| 1:07:16| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4036)|
| 1:07:17| I think perhaps early February is being optimistic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4037)|
| 1:07:22| But the only way that you're going to get the people involved in the process, or the best way to get them involved in the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4042)|
| 1:07:35| is to let them vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4055)|
| 1:07:37| Anything else, you can talk about involving the public and let's have public forums and public meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4057)|
| 1:07:47| At the end of the day, my suspicion is, is that those of us that are leaving office are going to be asked to make a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4067)|
| 1:07:55| And, you know, my recommendation may or may not be based on what those people at the meeting show up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4075)|
| 1:08:04| because you may have, it's not a full and open process unless the people get to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4084)|
| 1:08:12| So I'm going to support Commissioner Grease's motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4092)|
| 1:08:15| I seconded it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4095)|
| 1:08:21| And let the state legislature go to bat for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4101)|
| 1:08:25| It may be that we can have these positions filled by May the 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4105)|
| 1:08:31| And that's a far better cry than where we're headed right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4111)|
| 1:08:36| Okay. Commissioner Good, is that by a majority or two-thirds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4116)|
| 1:08:39| Because I've seen it two-thirds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4119)|
| 1:08:41| My understanding is it's just a simple majority, unless the law directors found something different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4121)|
| 1:08:48| What our legislative delegation has said is that they will certainly honor any request by a legislative body if it passes by two-thirds vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4128)|
| 1:08:59| And that's the request, special legislation, a private act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4139)|
| 1:09:04| So from what I understand, they require a two-thirds vote, which would be 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4144)|
| 1:09:10| Well, let me say this, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4150)|
| 1:09:13| If we pass it with ten votes and we send it to them and they turn us down because we only had ten, then shame on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4153)|
| 1:09:18| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4158)|
| 1:09:19| They can make that decision, not us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4159)|
| 1:09:20| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4160)|
| 1:09:21| I'm just restating what they have said publicly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4161)|
| 1:09:24| Did you know that last week when you and I talked?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4164)|
| 1:09:26| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4166)|
| 1:09:30| Okay. Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4170)|
| 1:09:33| Mr. Chairman, I think it will help us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4173)|
| 1:09:35| And I don't know what the whole game plan, what we want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4175)|
| 1:09:38| You want to meet next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4178)|
| 1:09:39| Can you walk us through what you want to do and how the meeting will go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4179)|
| 1:09:43| I'm like Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4183)|
| 1:09:46| I'm sort of back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4186)|
| 1:09:47| I mean, I could go ahead and vote now, but I want to know how the meeting is going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4187)|
| 1:09:52| Will the people get to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4192)|
| 1:09:53| If I'm a candidate from Farragut, will I be able to speak and give you something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4193)|
| 1:09:57| Or is there no speaking allowed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4197)|
| 1:10:00| What game plan do you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4200)|
| 1:10:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4201)|
| 1:10:02| This is just me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4202)|
| 1:10:03| This is how I think we should proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4203)|
| 1:10:06| I think over the next week to 29th, I think I wrote it down somewhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4206)|
| 1:10:11| have people send resumes either to the commission office and to the commissioners in their district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4211)|
| 1:10:17| Because how many times are we up here on zoning issues that people say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4217)|
| 1:10:20| listen to the commissioners in our district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4220)|
| 1:10:22| You don't live down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4222)|
| 1:10:23| We don't want these 15 houses built beside me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4223)|
| 1:10:25| These commissioners know our area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4225)|
| 1:10:27| They know what we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4227)|
| 1:10:28| I hope you pay some attention to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4228)|
| 1:10:30| And now we're saying, well, we just ought to let somebody vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4230)|
| 1:10:36| I don't think there's anybody on this commission that just don't want the citizens' input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4236)|
| 1:10:41| An election would be great, but I just don't think we have the time to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4241)|
| 1:10:46| You know, we took an oath to uphold the charter, to uphold the state constitution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4246)|
| 1:10:52| and now we're trying to get out of what we took an oath to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4252)|
| 1:10:57| And I know there's times like these right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4257)|
| 1:10:59| It's tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4259)|
| 1:11:00| We're getting a lot of calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4260)|
| 1:11:02| We have a lot of people interested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4262)|
| 1:11:05| We're in the process, and if we go outside of that process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4265)|
| 1:11:08| we're doing what we complain the most about some people legislating from the bench| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4268)|
| 1:11:14| instead of doing what the law says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4274)|
| 1:11:17| You know, I believe in law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4277)|
| 1:11:19| I was a policeman for 14 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4279)|
| 1:11:21| I respect the justice's decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4281)|
| 1:11:23| You know, I wish they could have probably done this a little better on direction, but they didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4283)|
| 1:11:29| So we're dealing with what they gave us to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4289)|
| 1:11:32| And, you know, we're a land of laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4292)|
| 1:11:34| And, Mr. Law Director, the things that I've talked to you about is certainly, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4294)|
| 1:11:39| does it go right down the way the law says appointments are made on this commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4299)|
| 1:11:46| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4306)|
| 1:11:47| What the chair and I have discussed is the procedure that's laid out in the Knox County Charter itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4307)|
| 1:11:54| and in the commission rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4314)|
| 1:11:56| Basically, we proceed as we have in the past in making appointments and filling vacancies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4316)|
| 1:12:08| You know, I don't think anybody would ever imagine that we'd have 12 seats to fill at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4328)|
| 1:12:14| But the fact of the matter is I've done five of them since I've been on this commission, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4334)|
| 1:12:18| And they've all worked out pretty well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4338)|
| 1:12:20| You know, the thing we have to be most careful right now is that we get qualified people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4340)|
| 1:12:25| to serve in these positions on an interim basis until we have a public election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4345)|
| 1:12:30| That's our job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4350)|
| 1:12:32| And, you know, if we didn't have to make tough decisions sometimes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4352)|
| 1:12:36| there'd be a lot more people running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4356)|
| 1:12:38| But, you know, when I ran just last year, there was only two people qualified in the seventh district seat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4358)|
| 1:12:44| beat a run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4364)|
| 1:12:45| That was me and my opponent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4365)|
| 1:12:47| And they knew when they voted for either one of us that this day would come sometime down the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4367)|
| 1:12:53| We're going to make hard decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4373)|
| 1:12:56| But that's why you elect people, to make these decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4376)|
| 1:13:00| We're going to take public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4380)|
| 1:13:01| And I think Commissioner Smith, I think people submit resumes to the commissioners in the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4381)|
| 1:13:06| If they want to, to the county commission office as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4386)|
| 1:13:08| I think that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4388)|
| 1:13:10| I hope they do it sooner than later and not come up at the last minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4390)|
| 1:13:12| I think by probably Monday, January 29th, in my mind, would be a day that we cut off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4392)|
| 1:13:20| Certainly, I think nominations, if someone comes in after that, can be nominated by rules and state statute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4400)|
| 1:13:25| if I'm correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4405)|
| 1:13:26| But I hope people come out early so they get a chance for the newspaper and the media to be in contact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4406)|
| 1:13:32| and talk to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4412)|
| 1:13:34| I think commissioners in your district can do whatever you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4414)|
| 1:13:36| I think if you want to have a meeting at the library or you want to have a meeting at a restaurant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4416)|
| 1:13:41| and tell people if they're interested, come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4421)|
| 1:13:44| People will be able to shake their hands and meet them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4424)|
| 1:13:46| But I don't think that we need to let people get out here and run campaigns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4426)|
| 1:13:50| because the people with the most money are going to win in a short race.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4430)|
| 1:13:55| And I think that doesn't do the citizens of Knox County well either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4435)|
| 1:13:59| I think the most important thing in this time is that we put qualified people that will do the job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4439)|
| 1:14:06| for the next 13 months until the public has an election to pick who they want to serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4446)|
| 1:14:13| for the next couple of years until the next election in 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4453)|
| 1:14:17| So that's kind of how I think it should go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4457)|
| 1:14:19| Follow state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4459)|
| 1:14:20| I think if we go outside state law, we're doing things that we criticize other people for doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4460)|
| 1:14:27| Well, here's a question that I've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4467)|
| 1:14:30| Yeah, if we can take it to the people, let's let them do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4470)|
| 1:14:34| Can I make a vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4474)|
| 1:14:35| Yeah, I can make a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4475)|
| 1:14:36| You know, I got into politics over 30 years ago because I wanted to make an educated vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4476)|
| 1:14:41| And me having somebody say, well, for such and such district whether other than town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4481)|
| 1:14:46| yeah, I can trust him, but I want to make sure that for my district that I've researched that individual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4486)|
| 1:14:50| that I know who that individual is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4490)|
| 1:14:52| And I'd like to at least have some candidates be able to give us some dialogue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4492)|
| 1:14:56| why they want to run for that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4496)|
| 1:14:59| So I just want a little bit of a dialogue with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4499)|
| 1:15:02| I mean, I can go either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4502)|
| 1:15:03| I can do this Wednesday and we can vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4503)|
| 1:15:04| Because let me tell you, there are some really good people here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4504)|
| 1:15:07| There's a lot of good candidates for all of these jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4507)|
| 1:15:10| And every day more and more people are added to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4510)|
| 1:15:12| But I just want it to be as open as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4512)|
| 1:15:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4515)|
| 1:15:19| Commissioner Schmidt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4519)|
| 1:15:21| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4521)|
| 1:15:22| I want to speak just to the election, what's on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4522)|
| 1:15:26| I think there are some flexibility in a process that may go along with what the chairman is saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4526)|
| 1:15:32| but also add some more public input that I'll speak later to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4532)|
| 1:15:35| But as for the election, I know in an ideal situation that would be the way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4535)|
| 1:15:41| But I think what is on us to deal with is, one, an election would take place in months from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4541)|
| 1:15:51| And the Supreme Court did give us direction in their opinion two Fridays ago by footnoting state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4551)|
| 1:15:58| Am I correct, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4558)|
| 1:15:59| The Constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4559)|
| 1:16:02| The Constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4562)|
| 1:16:03| And that's what we're having to live by right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4563)|
| 1:16:06| Secondly, an election, a winner-take-all, goes against, I think, what has served us well in this country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4566)|
| 1:16:14| a two-party system, which sort of coalesces ideas and beliefs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4574)|
| 1:16:18| And a winner-take-all, you may have an election process, five, six candidates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4578)|
| 1:16:23| which the winner, the winner-take-all, may not receive more than 15 or 20 percent of the votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4583)|
| 1:16:27| So it's not going to be a consensus candidate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4587)|
| 1:16:30| And I think that is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4590)|
| 1:16:31| Secondly, the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4591)|
| 1:16:33| Four of these offices are countywide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4593)|
| 1:16:36| To run a countywide campaign is not cheap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4596)|
| 1:16:39| It's not cheap to run a districtwide campaign, but certainly not a countywide campaign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4599)|
| 1:16:44| And so I think by the result of an election process, while well-intentioned, would have the opposite effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4604)|
| 1:16:52| It would narrow the list of candidates to those who have the pockets deep enough to finance it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4612)|
| 1:16:56| or the supporters who have deep pockets and may rule out grassroots candidates who often rely on a door-to-door| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4616)|
| 1:17:05| and using the media as a way of getting their names and their ideas out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4625)|
| 1:17:09| And I'm not willing to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4629)|
| 1:17:11| So I certainly speak against this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4631)|
| 1:17:14| I think if we move forward, you will find there are some options on a process that where we have to appoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4634)|
| 1:17:22| there will be some public input or at least some public scrutiny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4642)|
| 1:17:25| I'll leave it at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4645)|
| 1:17:26| But the election process, while well-intentioned, I think is just not a viable one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4646)|
| 1:17:33| And I hope that we vote this down and move on to look at some other options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4653)|
| 1:17:38| Commissioner Ivan Horman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4658)|
| 1:17:40| Yeah, I'd like to ask a question maybe to Greg and then also to our law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4660)|
| 1:17:44| I think the cost we're talking about is like $275,000 for a primary or a general election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4664)|
| 1:17:50| Is that right, Greg?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4670)|
| 1:17:53| A quarter of a million dollars?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4673)|
| 1:17:54| Yeah, that's about correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4674)|
| 1:17:56| And then I don't know if John or Greg, would the state election commission have anything to do with this if it was passed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4676)|
| 1:18:03| Do they have to honor the state if they do authorize us to have a special election?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4683)|
| 1:18:13| I don't, you know, good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4693)|
| 1:18:15| Maybe John should or Mr. Owens should handle that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4695)|
| 1:18:18| Most definitely the attorney general will weigh in at some level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4698)|
| 1:18:24| They may be involved in assisting to draft the legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4704)|
| 1:18:31| And then again, they may have some real difficulties with it early on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4711)|
| 1:18:37| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4717)|
| 1:18:38| I don't know what the attorney general will tell us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4718)|
| 1:18:40| I know that we have gotten a communication from the attorney general in the last few days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4720)|
| 1:18:45| who has opined that there is no special election statute that addresses this particular situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4725)|
| 1:18:54| And the attorney general then cites the Constitution and, in addition, the state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4734)|
| 1:18:59| which requires the vacancies to be filled by the county legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4739)|
| 1:19:04| But I don't know as to any potential legislation what the attorney general, you know, will say about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4744)|
| 1:19:13| Well, if the state supreme court had acted quicker, we might not have been in this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4753)|
| 1:19:17| Now, if the attorney general drags his feet or if he's busy, it could be another six or eight months before he even listens to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4757)|
| 1:19:22| Is that true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4762)|
| 1:19:23| I don't know how long it will take the attorney general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4763)|
| 1:19:26| Let me just add one thing to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4766)|
| 1:19:28| Say this resolution did pass today and it's four or five months down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4768)|
| 1:19:35| Could there be another order coming down from the supreme court of Tennessee just saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4775)|
| 1:19:42| okay, we gave you an opportunity to fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4782)|
| 1:19:44| You all are screwing around with the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4784)|
| 1:19:46| And so right now you guys are out of office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4786)|
| 1:19:51| And instead of making it a 19-member body, we all at once become 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4791)|
| 1:19:58| That is a possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4798)|
| 1:20:00| We have several lawsuits that are in various courts that are pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4800)|
| 1:20:05| We have an argument in a case that is in federal court next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4805)|
| 1:20:12| Arguments, I believe, begin at 1 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4812)|
| 1:20:15| Motions are being filed daily in that case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4815)|
| 1:20:20| Ultimately, that case may impact what we do in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4820)|
| 1:20:26| I don't know if it will or not, but it has a possibility of doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4826)|
| 1:20:31| And there are other lawsuits that exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4831)|
| 1:20:33| I know there were some election challenges that have been filed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4833)|
| 1:20:36| So a number of things can occur in the next month or two or three, which could limit what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4836)|
| 1:20:47| Okay, Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4847)|
| 1:20:48| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4848)|
| 1:20:49| A couple more questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4849)|
| 1:20:50| As it stands right now, as I understand it, in February we will have the presidential preference primary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4850)|
| 1:20:56| But as it stands now, we will not have a countywide election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4856)|
| 1:21:00| This body will need to vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4860)|
| 1:21:03| Is that correct or am I in error?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4863)|
| 1:21:06| From what I understand and from our charter, for the races that are scheduled for next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4866)|
| 1:21:15| and there are only a few, there's a handful of, and I hope I'm answering your question, at least partly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4875)|
| 1:21:23| There are a handful of races.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4883)|
| 1:21:24| There's the law director's race.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4884)|
| 1:21:27| There's the property assessor's race.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4887)|
| 1:21:29| And there are a handful of school board seats that are up next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4889)|
| 1:21:33| By the county charter, we are to hold the primary election next year on the same date as the presidential preference primary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4893)|
| 1:21:44| Unless this body, at least a year before the date that we were to decide as a body to hold the election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4904)|
| 1:21:53| passed an ordinance requiring a different date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4913)|
| 1:21:58| So, for instance, if by this May this body determined that it wanted to have its primary in May instead of next February, it could do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4918)|
| 1:22:07| That's what I wanted to clarify is, as it stands now, there will be an election February 10th if no action is taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4927)|
| 1:22:14| February the 12th, I believe, is the date, I believe, if I'm right, Greg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4934)|
| 1:22:22| As far as whether state law requires, Greg, do you know for sure if state law requires for this body to act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4942)|
| 1:22:32| for these newly term limited officials, whether state law requires that this body act to place them on the ballot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4952)|
| 1:22:45| It probably does, which we have plenty of time to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4965)|
| 1:22:53| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4973)|
| 1:22:54| You know, we'll probably have to check with Brooke Thompson about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4974)|
| 1:22:56| But I don't think that they would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4976)|
| 1:22:58| I mean, there's been a little bit of discussion about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4978)|
| 1:23:00| And I take it from reading what Brooke Thompson has stated in his letter that he is looking for action by this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4980)|
| 1:23:08| I don't know that that's required, but we will have that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4988)|
| 1:23:12| But we do have plenty of time to act that if we need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4992)|
| 1:23:15| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4995)|
| 1:23:16| So we're not going to be within, if we wait until next month, it's not going to hinder that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4996)|
| 1:23:19| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=4999)|
| 1:23:20| That's my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5000)|
| 1:23:21| Because I think it's imperative that we do have the election in February if this motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5001)|
| 1:23:26| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5006)|
| 1:23:27| Could we clarify, you had mentioned a January 29th date as to when individuals who were interested in any of these positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5007)|
| 1:23:35| would let their intentions be known.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5015)|
| 1:23:37| What do we need to do to formalize that so that the folks who are here today and who are interested in these positions tomorrow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5017)|
| 1:23:44| will know the procedure that they need to follow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5024)|
| 1:23:47| Well, I think a lot of media is here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5027)|
| 1:23:49| I think the new Sentinel will have it in there tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5029)|
| 1:23:52| And I think that we should ask people, if they're interested in serving this community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5032)|
| 1:23:55| that they submit their names and any other material, if it's a resume or anything else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5035)|
| 1:24:02| to the commissioners in the district if they're running for county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5042)|
| 1:24:05| Also, they could send it to the commission office just so we could have it on file.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5045)|
| 1:24:09| Also, I thank you for running for a county-wide office, that you submit your name and any other material you wish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5049)|
| 1:24:17| to the commission office, and we'll distribute it to all 19 members of this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5057)|
| 1:24:23| Let me just add something on top of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5063)|
| 1:24:26| You know, we make appointments just about every month on this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5066)|
| 1:24:31| Some of them may not be, you think, as important as this one, but we just made one to the public building authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5071)|
| 1:24:37| And Mr. Stokes is a fine person, a good citizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5077)|
| 1:24:41| I think he cares about this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5081)|
| 1:24:43| But, you know, for a year and a half, you know, the PBA board could have took action and opened this garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5083)|
| 1:24:50| So it's very important that we put people on those boards that can to take, you know, to take action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5090)|
| 1:24:57| And, you know, so we make appointments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5097)|
| 1:25:00| and we don't have public input on who we're going to put on the public building authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5100)|
| 1:25:04| or the development corporation that holds, say, 10 or $12 million in a bunch of land right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5104)|
| 1:25:12| or the industrial development board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5112)|
| 1:25:13| We don't have public hearing on those folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5113)|
| 1:25:16| So, you know, I think trying to change the process just because it doesn't fit someone's agenda, I think it's wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5116)|
| 1:25:24| I think we need to move forward under the state statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5124)|
| 1:25:29| Commissioner Mills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5129)|
| 1:25:33| Well, whatever plan you come up with, someone's going to shoot a hole in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5133)|
| 1:25:37| But I want to get back to what you're saying is that you would like for everyone to submit a resume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5137)|
| 1:25:48| Now, one district could have 10 resumes, and someone submit five pages on that resume, and someone submit a paragraph.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5148)|
| 1:26:01| That decision is still going to be made right here on this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5161)|
| 1:26:06| Now, a resume is a resume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5166)|
| 1:26:10| Well, Commissioner Mills, I don't mean to interrupt you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5170)|
| 1:26:12| Well, I didn't say a resume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5172)|
| 1:26:14| You do or you wouldn't have said that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5174)|
| 1:26:15| Well, I mean, we didn't ask for a resume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5175)|
| 1:26:17| We just said we can't ask people to do that, I don't think, according to law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5177)|
| 1:26:21| What do you want them to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5181)|
| 1:26:22| We want them to submit their name and any supporting material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5182)|
| 1:26:26| And that could be a letter saying I'm interested in serving on commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5186)|
| 1:26:30| or it could be a resume with all their qualifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5190)|
| 1:26:33| But I think we just need to, and that puts everybody in a system who wants to get involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5193)|
| 1:26:45| Well, you asked it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5205)|
| 1:26:48| Why do I have to be your spokesperson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5208)|
| 1:26:54| I mean, is that right, John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5214)|
| 1:26:55| I mean, if we ask people to, can we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5215)|
| 1:26:57| You can ask people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5217)|
| 1:27:00| You can give them the opportunity to present their qualifications for office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5220)|
| 1:27:03| is what I would be interested in if I were a member of this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5223)|
| 1:27:08| Is that a resume?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5228)|
| 1:27:10| Which would include a resume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5230)|
| 1:27:12| They can submit it or they don't have to submit it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5232)|
| 1:27:15| The floor will be open for nominations on the appointment day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5235)|
| 1:27:21| whether they have submitted their applications or qualifications or resume or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5241)|
| 1:27:27| Well, that's the point I'm making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5247)|
| 1:27:29| Someone could submit material, all right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5249)|
| 1:27:32| So you'd be happy, Scott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5252)|
| 1:27:34| Someone can submit some material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5254)|
| 1:27:36| And then on the day that we're going to do the appointing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5256)|
| 1:27:42| there could be five more people that say, hey, I'd like to have that job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5262)|
| 1:27:47| So you're not just going to throw them out just because they didn't send you a letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5267)|
| 1:27:52| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5272)|
| 1:27:53| Point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5273)|
| 1:27:54| Point of what order?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5274)|
| 1:27:56| The question on the floor is the election, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5276)|
| 1:27:59| Special election?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5279)|
| 1:28:01| Uh-huh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5281)|
| 1:28:02| And I just think we're talking about a process may be getting the cart and the head of the horse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5282)|
| 1:28:06| I think we need to decide if this body wants to do the special election or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5286)|
| 1:28:09| So just for the sake of time, I'm just pointing out that maybe we ought to vote on the election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5289)|
| 1:28:14| and then go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5294)|
| 1:28:15| If that fails and if it doesn't, go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5295)|
| 1:28:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5297)|
| 1:28:18| I'm fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5298)|
| 1:28:19| So I vote no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5299)|
| 1:28:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5301)|
| 1:28:22| Point of order, since we're doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5302)|
| 1:28:24| I did put my name on the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5304)|
| 1:28:26| We'll let you speak and just let me get the commissioners done first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5306)|
| 1:28:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5309)|
| 1:28:30| We've got a couple of people to speak and then we'll come back if commissioners have questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5310)|
| 1:28:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5314)|
| 1:28:35| We'll let you speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5315)|
| 1:28:36| I promise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5316)|
| 1:28:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5317)|
| 1:28:38| Commissioner Ballard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5318)|
| 1:28:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5319)|
| 1:28:40| I would like to say, of course, a special election is a popular way for this to be resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5320)|
| 1:28:45| And a lot of us, you know, I'm not saying that it's the easy way out, but everyone that's up here today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5325)|
| 1:28:53| is getting a ton of phone calls and faxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5333)|
| 1:28:56| And to be honest with you, not all of mine are for a special election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5336)|
| 1:29:00| I've just sat down and wrote a few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5340)|
| 1:29:02| A lot of the people want the second-in-command in some of the offices to take charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5342)|
| 1:29:08| My wife won't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5348)|
| 1:29:09| The candidates, you know, when you say qualified candidates, I'm not so sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5349)|
| 1:29:18| I'm not so sure what a qualified candidate is when you look at the depth and breadth of us here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5358)|
| 1:29:24| You know, but the variety of life experiences sort of put us up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5364)|
| 1:29:29| But, you know, a downside to putting a candidate in a short run like this off the street into a register of deeds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5369)|
| 1:29:36| or something, that is a business office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5376)|
| 1:29:38| They could do a lot of damage in just a short amount of time, four months if they're in there for a special election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5378)|
| 1:29:44| And then I've also had input that people that came in second in the election that we've had be appointed to the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5384)|
| 1:29:53| So, basically, we've had every solution but the biblical one of casting lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5393)|
| 1:29:58| And I think the most speediest way to resolve this is by us doing what we need to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5398)|
| 1:30:05| and that is make the appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5405)|
| 1:30:07| And this will end this and start the healing process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5407)|
| 1:30:11| It's only short term until February, be it by election or by appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5411)|
| 1:30:15| And if we make a mistake here, it certainly can be corrected in February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5415)|
| 1:30:19| That's all I have to say on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5419)|
| 1:30:21| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5421)|
| 1:30:23| I feel like we ought to do like the state constitution says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5423)|
| 1:30:27| That's our job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5427)|
| 1:30:29| The people do have input because they elected us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5429)|
| 1:30:32| We are their representatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5432)|
| 1:30:34| We were elected to do our job, and that's what the constitution and the charter of Knox County calls for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5434)|
| 1:30:40| If we appoint these people, it's over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5440)|
| 1:30:43| We need to get these people in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5443)|
| 1:30:45| We've got an upcoming budget coming, and it's going to be tight for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5445)|
| 1:30:48| And we're talking about roughly $550,000, over half a million dollars according to the grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5448)|
| 1:30:55| And that's 275 and 275.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5455)|
| 1:30:57| That's money that we need to save because we're going to be funding a sheriff's pension thing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5457)|
| 1:31:02| And we've got a lot of things that face us, and we need to save this county every penny that we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5462)|
| 1:31:08| We do not need to waste money at this critical time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5468)|
| 1:31:12| Now, as far as qualifications, I don't know if anybody goes over here and gets a degree in county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5472)|
| 1:31:18| Maybe I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5478)|
| 1:31:19| But nobody is qualified for this job until they get here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5479)|
| 1:31:23| There's nobody here that was qualified when they were elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5483)|
| 1:31:26| Now, you couldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5486)|
| 1:31:27| Commissioner Mills asked me about the qualifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5487)|
| 1:31:29| And I said, well, we could go along with what the Sentinel says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5489)|
| 1:31:32| I said, ask them what movie I like and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5492)|
| 1:31:35| That's what they said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5495)|
| 1:31:37| Let's get over this and get back to our charter and the Constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5497)|
| 1:31:42| That's all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5502)|
| 1:31:45| Okay, I think Commissioner Grace is next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5505)|
| 1:31:48| Just a couple of quick comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5508)|
| 1:31:50| I mean, there's been some discussion that this is a short-term appointment when, in fact, it's a 19-month appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5510)|
| 1:31:56| It's two budget cycles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5516)|
| 1:31:58| It's half of the mayor's term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5518)|
| 1:32:00| It's half of those remaining commissioners' terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5520)|
| 1:32:03| And so to say this, let's just do it the easy way and make some appointments because it does not matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5523)|
| 1:32:08| Well, it does matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5528)|
| 1:32:09| If we appoint people in February or January 31st, whatever date, that's through August of 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5529)|
| 1:32:16| That's a big-time appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5536)|
| 1:32:17| And so the question is, do we want the people to make those appointments or do we want to make them ourselves?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5537)|
| 1:32:23| Do we think we're better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5543)|
| 1:32:24| We know more than the people when it comes to figuring out who the qualified candidate is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5544)|
| 1:32:28| And I suggest to you, if it takes two more months to get this election through the state legislature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5548)|
| 1:32:35| and a winner-take-all single election, I think that's the smart way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5555)|
| 1:32:39| I'm done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5559)|
| 1:32:40| By the way, you mentioned someone's agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5560)|
| 1:32:42| Well, apparently a lot of people have agendas up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5562)|
| 1:32:45| I'm not casting stones at anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5565)|
| 1:32:47| I have an agenda, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5567)|
| 1:32:48| I'd like for the people to vote, and that's why I advocate the position that I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5568)|
| 1:32:51| Well, you know, I was only mentioning agendas because if you get 90 candidates out here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5571)|
| 1:32:57| and they can get 30 people to come to these public forums or public meetings, they've got an agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5577)|
| 1:33:02| The thing is that we are bound by law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5582)|
| 1:33:06| When we took this job, we all signed our name to run for this office and we knew what we had to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5586)|
| 1:33:12| Now, to say, well, I think someone else can do it better would be a nice way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5592)|
| 1:33:17| But, in fact, we have to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5597)|
| 1:33:20| I'll follow up quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5600)|
| 1:33:21| That's not the intent of my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5601)|
| 1:33:22| It's not to spit in the face of the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5602)|
| 1:33:25| It's to ask the law accommodate our special situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5605)|
| 1:33:29| Commissioner Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5609)|
| 1:33:31| I think we've beaten this horse to death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5611)|
| 1:33:33| I'm going to call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5613)|
| 1:33:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5616)|
| 1:33:37| I guess we need to vote on the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5617)|
| 1:33:40| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5620)|
| 1:33:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5622)|
| 1:33:43| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5623)|
| 1:33:44| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5624)|
| 1:33:45| I can't tell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5625)|
| 1:33:48| You've got two lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5628)|
| 1:33:49| You've got a lady at the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5629)|
| 1:33:51| You've only got one light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5631)|
| 1:33:52| You also have some public that wants to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5632)|
| 1:33:54| Let's do the two lights if we have no objections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5634)|
| 1:33:58| And then we'll get the two people that signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5638)|
| 1:34:01| So, Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5641)|
| 1:34:02| You know, I want something in the middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5642)|
| 1:34:05| You know, I'm just not comfortable with people or with not being able to hear from the candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5645)|
| 1:34:13| I think we owe it to the candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5653)|
| 1:34:15| You know, when we all ran, we gave a platform what we want to do, how we want to better Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5655)|
| 1:34:21| I don't know what you can say on a resume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5661)|
| 1:34:23| I want to see their fire in their belly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5663)|
| 1:34:24| I want to see them at the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5664)|
| 1:34:26| And I want to see their passion and conviction, what they want to do for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5666)|
| 1:34:30| And that's what helps me and what they've done in the community and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5670)|
| 1:34:34| I mean, hey, I can appoint people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5674)|
| 1:34:36| I can do that today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5676)|
| 1:34:38| But I think we owe it to the public to let them see what they're getting to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5678)|
| 1:34:43| I just want to have some sort of input from the candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5683)|
| 1:34:47| We don't have to have the public ask questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5687)|
| 1:34:49| But if you're a candidate and you want to run, we ought to have this on this 31st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5689)|
| 1:34:52| We ought to go ahead and do it on the 31st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5692)|
| 1:34:53| I'm ready for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5693)|
| 1:34:54| But let's let these people give them three to five minutes and say what they want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5694)|
| 1:34:58| And that helps me know that I made an educated vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5698)|
| 1:35:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5702)|
| 1:35:03| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5703)|
| 1:35:05| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5705)|
| 1:35:07| I think we should behave as if we understood that our power is derived from the consent of the governed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5707)|
| 1:35:14| And that that means that on balance, I see great merit to Commissioner Grease's proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5714)|
| 1:35:20| And if that fails, I hope that we will at least go with the middle ground of my proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5720)|
| 1:35:24| And if that fails, I hope we will have at least a broad range of forums and discussions that Commissioner Smith is talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5724)|
| 1:35:32| We're going to talk a lot in the next few, ten days actually, about what is our proper motive for voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5732)|
| 1:35:39| You know, maintain political balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5739)|
| 1:35:43| Have something that pleases the legacy of those who are leaving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5743)|
| 1:35:47| Have something that pleases the working ability of those who are remaining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5747)|
| 1:35:50| I think our greatest obligations are first to find persons of good ability to do these jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5750)|
| 1:35:56| but also, more importantly, to respect the will of the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5756)|
| 1:36:00| So that's sort of my sequencing of how we do things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5760)|
| 1:36:03| And I will announce that I am going to hold a public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5763)|
| 1:36:06| I'll release details tomorrow in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5766)|
| 1:36:09| And it's going to be a staggered forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5769)|
| 1:36:12| And it's going to start out about 6 in the evening with those who wish the second commission district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5772)|
| 1:36:16| I invite my good colleague, Billy Tinnitt, who will be there to help me do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5776)|
| 1:36:20| I then will move on maybe an hour later to the candidates who want county wide office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5780)|
| 1:36:25| and finally to those who want any other commission seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5785)|
| 1:36:28| I'll find a large venue and do this because I think it's important one way or another to get public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5788)|
| 1:36:33| So I'm going to stagger my response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5793)|
| 1:36:35| I like Mr. Greese's motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5795)|
| 1:36:37| I like my own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5797)|
| 1:36:39| And if we can't get either of those, I'll go for public forums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5799)|
| 1:36:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5802)|
| 1:36:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5803)|
| 1:36:44| Could you give your name and address for the record, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5804)|
| 1:36:46| Point of order first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5806)|
| 1:36:47| Point of order first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5807)|
| 1:36:49| Are we now going to open this up to a public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5809)|
| 1:36:53| Or how are we going to conduct this from here on out by hearing this meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5813)|
| 1:36:57| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5817)|
| 1:36:58| Because if we open it up, then everyone in the audience can come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5818)|
| 1:37:02| And I have nothing against that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5822)|
| 1:37:05| I can sit here for four more months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5825)|
| 1:37:07| But I have nothing against that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5827)|
| 1:37:10| I'm just saying we need some kind of procedure where you cut this off or where you add to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5830)|
| 1:37:14| Well, we've got two people that signed up early for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5834)|
| 1:37:18| Do you want to let these two people speak now or wait until public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5838)|
| 1:37:21| I don't really care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5841)|
| 1:37:23| I just want to know how we're going because I don't want two or three have an opportunity to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5843)|
| 1:37:27| and someone else out there wants to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5847)|
| 1:37:29| And we say, hey, we don't have time for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5849)|
| 1:37:32| So we need some kind of something here to say we're going to open this floor up now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5852)|
| 1:37:38| and let everyone come up and have their say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5858)|
| 1:37:40| Just a reminder, we have another item on the agenda that will prompt, I'm sure, much more discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5860)|
| 1:37:45| Should we wait until public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5865)|
| 1:37:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5867)|
| 1:37:48| Why don't you sit down and we'll call you at public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5868)|
| 1:37:51| Call me at public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5871)|
| 1:37:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5872)|
| 1:37:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5873)|
| 1:37:55| What's on the floor, Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5875)|
| 1:37:56| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5876)|
| 1:37:58| Commissioner Jordan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5878)|
| 1:37:59| I thought that we would let people speak on an issue while we were yet discussing it, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5879)|
| 1:38:05| rather than for them to wait for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5885)|
| 1:38:08| I mean, we are discussing this issue and I thought that we had agreed to let, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5888)|
| 1:38:14| Well, is she going to talk about this issue or she's going to talk about the next one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5894)|
| 1:38:18| She's going to talk about this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5898)|
| 1:38:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5899)|
| 1:38:20| She's talking about this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5900)|
| 1:38:21| Special election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5901)|
| 1:38:22| Special election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5902)|
| 1:38:23| Are you going to talk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5903)|
| 1:38:24| Do you want to talk on the special election?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5904)|
| 1:38:27| Then let her speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5907)|
| 1:38:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5908)|
| 1:38:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5909)|
| 1:38:30| If you'll come back to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5910)|
| 1:38:31| And the floor is open to everyone that wants to speak on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5911)|
| 1:38:35| Special election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5915)|
| 1:38:36| On the special election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5916)|
| 1:38:37| On a special.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5917)|
| 1:38:38| On this one item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5918)|
| 1:38:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5919)|
| 1:38:40| I'll try and make this as brief as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5920)|
| 1:38:43| Well, you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5923)|
| 1:38:45| It's 324.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5925)|
| 1:38:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5926)|
| 1:38:47| Thirteen or fourteen years ago, American citizens who were or legally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5927)|
| 1:38:52| Chairman, ask first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5932)|
| 1:38:53| You've got to give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5933)|
| 1:38:55| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5935)|
| 1:38:56| My name is Ruby Wright at 4320 Skyline Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37914.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5936)|
| 1:39:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5943)|
| 1:39:04| Thirteen or fourteen years ago, American citizens who were or were or are legal residents of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5944)|
| 1:39:11| the state of Tennessee and of Knox County got together and studied the state constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5951)|
| 1:39:16| The residents were obviously looking for a legal avenue to solve the problems of getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5956)|
| 1:39:21| corrupt, deceitful, incompetent, and unjust officials out of office who sought to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5961)|
| 1:39:26| positive changes for only a few in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5966)|
| 1:39:29| While ignoring the rest of the county, not a part of those positive changes to fend for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5969)|
| 1:39:34| themselves, leaving the rest of the, excuse me, leaving the rest of the county not a part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5974)|
| 1:39:40| of those positive changes to fend for themselves and using all of the county's assets to allocate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5980)|
| 1:39:45| for use to accomplish their goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5985)|
| 1:39:48| These residents discovered that term limits could be imposed on certain elected officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5988)|
| 1:39:54| and the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5994)|
| 1:39:56| Petitions were signed by voting residents of the county and in accordance with the rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=5996)|
| 1:40:01| of the govern, that govern placing an ordinance on the ballot to vote for or against an issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6001)|
| 1:40:09| by the voters that is concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6009)|
| 1:40:12| The ordinance carried by an overwhelming majority in favor of term limits in 1994.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6012)|
| 1:40:18| The existing county commissioners at the time, realizing what this would do to their power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6018)|
| 1:40:23| and control over manipulating the taxpayer's money, filed a complaint with the state attorney| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6023)|
| 1:40:28| general's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6028)|
| 1:40:29| The commissioners sought to have the voters declared incompetent to make such a decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6029)|
| 1:40:36| by having the attorney general declare term limits unconstitutional in 1995.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6036)|
| 1:40:41| This allowed the corruption, incompetence, deceit, and injustice to continue through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6041)|
| 1:40:45| their arrogance and greed to own power, which worked to serve the, worked to serve only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6045)|
| 1:40:51| those that the positive changes empowered using the taxpayer's monies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6051)|
| 1:40:56| The right to govern, the right to have term limits were again challenged and the decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6056)|
| 1:41:02| was sent to the Tennessee Supreme Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6062)|
| 1:41:05| The Tennessee Supreme Court upheld the decision of term limits for certain elected officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6065)|
| 1:41:10| to provide as provided by the Tennessee state constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6070)|
| 1:41:16| Rather than these eight commissioners and the sheriff work in the best interest of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6076)|
| 1:41:22| county by not running until the Tennessee state supreme court ruled one way or another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6082)|
| 1:41:28| as they knew that this issue was up for review, these eight ran anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6088)|
| 1:41:35| Now the county is faced with the prospect of having these eight vacancies be filled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6095)|
| 1:41:41| by commissioners whose terms will not be up until the next election, and some of whom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6101)|
| 1:41:47| played a part in the decision of 1995 as the state, as the Tennessee Supreme Court has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6107)|
| 1:41:53| ruled out of the prospect of special elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6113)|
| 1:41:57| Now we have special elections again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6117)|
| 1:42:00| Therefore, there is only one equitable solution to this problem created by the county commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6120)|
| 1:42:06| who challenged the will of the people in 1995 by stripping the people of their right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6126)|
| 1:42:12| to decide what is or is not in their best interest with the voiding of their vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6132)|
| 1:42:20| The commissioner shall be required to appoint in the best interest of ethics the person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6140)|
| 1:42:26| who had the second highest votes in each of the districts affected since the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6146)|
| 1:42:32| who voted for the runner-ups used their votes responsibly by using their vote in favor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6152)|
| 1:42:38| of the ordinance on term limits, as voted overwhelmingly in 1994 by the voters of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6158)|
| 1:42:46| Whether the person is independent Democrat or Republican should not matter, as the appointment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6166)|
| 1:42:52| should reflect some confidence of what the voters want, as the county commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6172)|
| 1:42:58| remaining are just as guilty as the ones who have to leave by law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6178)|
| 1:43:03| And therefore, any appointment that is other than the runner-up from the election held| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6183)|
| 1:43:09| in 2006 should be viewed as a circumvention around the decision of the Tennessee Supreme| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6189)|
| 1:43:15| Court that reeks of cronyism and would leave the voters of the county feeling that there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6195)|
| 1:43:21| really is no value to their vote and that officials do not represent the people, people's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6201)|
| 1:43:27| best interest, but their own personal agendas, not shared by the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6207)|
| 1:43:32| We pay to do the people's will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6212)|
| 1:43:35| That's all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6215)|
| 1:43:37| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6217)|
| 1:43:43| Okay, we've got anybody else that wants to speak on this issue of a special election?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6223)|
| 1:43:47| Be in favor or against?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6227)|
| 1:43:51| I'd like to speak on the issue, but not necessarily in favor or against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6231)|
| 1:43:55| Well, you might need, let's hold you for public forum then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6235)|
| 1:43:59| I mean, because right now we need to talk about just the special election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6239)|
| 1:44:03| Well, you've got a forum on the term limits and the Supreme Court ruling already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6243)|
| 1:44:10| You've got two people on those two topics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6250)|
| 1:44:13| Are they irrelevant to the question before the commission right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6253)|
| 1:44:19| Are they irrelevant to the question of a special election?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6259)|
| 1:44:24| Just, sir, due to the, we've got rules of the commission and only commissioners, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6264)|
| 1:44:28| can talk about issues that's before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6268)|
| 1:44:31| The issue right now is do you want to have a special election or do you not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6271)|
| 1:44:35| I mean, that's, you can talk to that issue, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6275)|
| 1:44:38| Well, I'll talk to that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6278)|
| 1:44:40| I'd like to see a special election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6280)|
| 1:44:42| We need your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6282)|
| 1:44:44| Mac Simpson, 5547 Woodburn Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6284)|
| 1:44:54| The question of a special election assumes somewhat the importance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6294)|
| 1:44:58| before the local government of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6298)|
| 1:45:02| It seems to me that Iraq holds before the United States government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6302)|
| 1:45:09| or certainly then the president's ability to govern holds before the United States government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6309)|
| 1:45:15| State government is a very active scene right at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6315)|
| 1:45:20| I spent my life talking about governments, not just government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6320)|
| 1:45:25| but governments and not just politics, but politics at the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6325)|
| 1:45:32| And I don't think that I can get away from talking about some things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6332)|
| 1:45:38| that are a little bit off from the center core of special election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6338)|
| 1:45:43| We can say special election, special election, special election and say it 15 times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6343)|
| 1:45:49| And we're not much closer to understanding what a special election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6349)|
| 1:45:53| what importance it assumes to this community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6353)|
| 1:45:56| and what importance the people whom we're going to elect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6356)|
| 1:46:00| if we elect to have a special election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6360)|
| 1:46:03| what the importance of those people is to the people of this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6363)|
| 1:46:08| I'm not getting close to my five minutes, but I'm getting close to sitting down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6368)|
| 1:46:20| Thank you, Mac.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6380)|
| 1:46:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6384)|
| 1:46:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6387)|
| 1:46:30| We've had a call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6390)|
| 1:46:32| We're on the Resolution 907.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6392)|
| 1:46:35| Commissioner Grace, do you want to state your motion again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6395)|
| 1:46:39| Yeah, I'll do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6399)|
| 1:46:41| We'll wait for Commissioner Lambert to get back as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6401)|
| 1:46:45| But the motion is to, with the help of the state legislature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6405)|
| 1:46:51| ask for a special election to fill these offices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6411)|
| 1:46:55| with the caveat being that it would be a single election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6415)|
| 1:47:00| or take all, regardless of what percent the top vote getter gets in each category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6420)|
| 1:47:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6426)|
| 1:47:07| So we're ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6427)|
| 1:47:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6429)|
| 1:47:10| Commissioner Ballard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6430)|
| 1:47:11| It's been brought up about a majority or two-thirds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6431)|
| 1:47:15| Does that factor into this vote at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6435)|
| 1:47:17| I guess we can send it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6437)|
| 1:47:18| If it gets ten, we can send it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6438)|
| 1:47:19| But I read in the paper, I believe it said Senator Burson requested two-thirds majority of this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6439)|
| 1:47:26| Let's see what it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6446)|
| 1:47:27| Tell us again when you think that vote or the election would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6447)|
| 1:47:31| How long?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6451)|
| 1:47:32| I don't think anybody knows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6452)|
| 1:47:38| I mean, it's got to go through their committees on both House and the Senate side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6458)|
| 1:47:43| signed by the governor, passed on the floors of both Houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6463)|
| 1:47:47| It could possibly be at the end of session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6467)|
| 1:47:54| Or it could possibly be in the first week of February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6474)|
| 1:47:56| It could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6476)|
| 1:47:57| That's a chance this body is going to take that the Supreme Court may come down and throw everybody out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6477)|
| 1:48:03| and then you're going to leave with 11 instead of 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6483)|
| 1:48:07| So we're ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6487)|
| 1:48:10| So all in favor of a special election say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6490)|
| 1:48:13| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6493)|
| 1:48:14| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6494)|

| 1:48:17| Roll call it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6497)|
| 1:48:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6498)|
| 1:48:19| We'll do a roll call starting in the ninth district for Commissioner Jordan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6499)|
| 1:48:25| Ninth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6505)|

| 1:49:33| We didn't have 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6573)|
| 1:49:34| I mean, five noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6574)|
| 1:49:35| Could you ask if anybody wants to change it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6575)|
| 1:49:37| Five ayes and 14 noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6577)|

| 1:49:40| You can't do it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6580)|

| 1:49:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6582)|

| 1:50:30| Seconded by Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6630)|
| 1:50:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6632)|
| 1:50:34| Commissioner Harmon, you have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6634)|
| 1:50:35| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6635)|
| 1:50:36| As you heard in the previous debate, Commissioner Smith, Commissioner Mike Hammond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6636)|
| 1:50:43| were struggling with the notion of trying to get as much public involvement with, at the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6643)|
| 1:50:48| struggling to get a speedy process that resolves the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6648)|
| 1:50:51| And this is my way of trying to accomplish both goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6651)|
| 1:50:56| It seems to me that one thing we could do is a non-binding referendum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6656)|
| 1:51:02| fancy word, plebiscite, but a non-binding referendum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6662)|
| 1:51:05| My resolution has a very specific timetable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6665)|
| 1:51:08| We would seek persons who would self-nominate in the period from January 23rd, closing February 6th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6668)|
| 1:51:14| Next ten days, the Commission would hold one or more public forums| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6674)|
| 1:51:18| where people could stand up and speak about who they are, why they want the job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6678)|
| 1:51:23| and face questioning from the Commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6683)|
| 1:51:25| and perhaps a forum where they could face questioning from the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6685)|
| 1:51:28| I've heard it said that anybody can stack a meeting, but you know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6688)|
| 1:51:31| When a bunch of groups try to stack a meeting, what you have is something called good attendance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6691)|
| 1:51:35| And then, February 17th through the 24th, we actually conduct this plebiscite| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6695)|
| 1:51:40| using the early voting sites only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6700)|
| 1:51:45| That will significantly reduce the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6705)|
| 1:51:47| And then the results of that would come before us as a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6707)|
| 1:51:50| And as any motion that comes before us, we could ignore it, we could amend it, or we could pass it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6710)|
| 1:51:56| But I would suggest that we would ignore the will of the voters in this case at our peril.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6716)|
| 1:52:00| I think this is the proper way that gets it done most speedily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6720)|
| 1:52:03| and finds a way to incorporate the will of the voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6723)|
| 1:52:06| I know there's some modest cost involved of running a plebiscite,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6726)|
| 1:52:09| but it's significantly less cost than going through two election cycles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6729)|
| 1:52:13| as we've already defeated anyhow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6733)|
| 1:52:15| and it opens up the processes a little more respect for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6735)|
| 1:52:18| We may do a very good job and may run a very good meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6738)|
| 1:52:21| but if the public doesn't believe us, what good was it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6741)|
| 1:52:24| So my suggestion is that this plebiscite has a lot of merit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6744)|
| 1:52:27| and a lot of people will go for this non-binding referendum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6747)|
| 1:52:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6750)|
| 1:52:31| Commissioner Schmidt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6751)|
| 1:52:34| I commend Commissioner Harmon on attempting a solution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6754)|
| 1:52:38| and I pretty much agree with much of what he says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6758)|
| 1:52:41| The only problem I have with it, and even a second, I want to get this on the floor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6761)|
| 1:52:45| was the non-binding vote at a cost of public money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6765)|
| 1:52:50| I'm a little skeptical of that because it's non-binding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6770)|
| 1:52:54| and, therefore, we might go through the process of spending money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6774)|
| 1:52:57| for a vote that none of us may even agree on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6777)|
| 1:53:00| We are a representative democracy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6780)|
| 1:53:02| Therefore, we do represent the interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6782)|
| 1:53:04| We hope to represent the interests of our constituents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6784)|
| 1:53:06| and that is the process in which we have set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6786)|
| 1:53:10| Commissioner Schmidt, may I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6790)|
| 1:53:12| Go ahead, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6792)|
| 1:53:13| The reason I made it non-binding is to make it binding would make it the equivalent of an election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6793)|
| 1:53:17| with bringing all sorts of election regulations, which would stretch it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6797)|
| 1:53:20| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6800)|
| 1:53:21| But also, I will go back to my previous set about Commissioner Greese's resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6801)|
| 1:53:26| you know, sort of a winner-take-all without any way of coalescing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6806)|
| 1:53:29| and narrowing the number of candidates where we might have somebody that wins by a simple 15%, 20%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6809)|
| 1:53:34| And that's not exactly a ringing endorsement within a district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6814)|
| 1:53:39| Secondly, I believe, and I want to direct these questions to the law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6819)|
| 1:53:45| the charter in the state law of Tennessee does allow some flexibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6825)|
| 1:53:49| in setting up a process to appointing people to fill vacated spots, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6829)|
| 1:53:57| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6837)|
| 1:53:58| So there is some flexibility there where there might be some public input or public scrutiny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6838)|
| 1:54:03| I'd rather use the word public scrutiny of appointees we might make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6843)|
| 1:54:07| And with all due respect to your resolution, which, like I said, I agree with much of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6847)|
| 1:54:11| I want to offer a substitute motion that basically takes out the non-binding vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6851)|
| 1:54:17| I would, this substitute motion would spell out a process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6857)|
| 1:54:23| that would lead to an appointment by this commission for these 12 positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6863)|
| 1:54:29| I want to specify that the eight county commission posts that would be vacated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6869)|
| 1:54:35| would be left to the district commissioners to decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6875)|
| 1:54:40| if they wanted to have public meetings within their district and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6880)|
| 1:54:43| I want to speak specifically to the four countywide offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6883)|
| 1:54:48| Because these posts are extremely important and have such wide range impact on our county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6888)|
| 1:54:56| I think there is a need for some public scrutiny of those who seek these jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6896)|
| 1:55:00| through the appointment process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6900)|
| 1:55:02| So I would first in this substitute motion ask that in lieu of this special meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6902)|
| 1:55:11| as called by Chairman Moore on the 31st of January that he would draw that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6911)|
| 1:55:16| and that we instead, that he direct the county commission office to post on the website| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6916)|
| 1:55:23| notice that these spots will be vacated and anyone interested should,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6923)|
| 1:55:28| if they wish to seek these spots, notify the office of their interest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6928)|
| 1:55:32| whether it be verbal notification or written notification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6932)|
| 1:55:35| There's nothing legal we can do to require notification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6935)|
| 1:55:39| Secondly, I request that on this substitute motion that we set a deadline for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6939)|
| 1:55:47| the request for interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6947)|
| 1:55:50| I make this as a request because there is legally no way we can prevent someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6950)|
| 1:55:55| from being nominated from the floor the day of the appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6955)|
| 1:55:58| I recognize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6958)|
| 1:56:00| That is just something we'll have to live with in the state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6960)|
| 1:56:03| but we can request people give us notice of their interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6963)|
| 1:56:08| I also put in this substitute resolution that that deadline for request be made by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6968)|
| 1:56:15| February 5th, which is a Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6975)|
| 1:56:21| and that subsequently the commission office notify the rest of this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6981)|
| 1:56:26| of those people interested in these four countywide offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6986)|
| 1:56:30| I also ask that the chairman set aside a night for public hearings for those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6990)|
| 1:56:35| who have shown interest in these positions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6995)|
| 1:56:39| where we can hear their qualifications for the job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=6999)|
| 1:56:41| they can come in front of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7001)|
| 1:56:43| where we can ask questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7003)|
| 1:56:45| the media can record their answers and broadcast them and publish them in the newspaper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7005)|
| 1:56:51| and there will be some level of public scrutiny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7011)|
| 1:56:54| And then I, in this substitute motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7014)|
| 1:56:57| ask that the chairman call a special session of the county commission after these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7017)|
| 1:57:01| public hearings sometime between the time of those public hearings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7021)|
| 1:57:04| and the next commission meeting scheduled for February,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7024)|
| 1:57:07| which is the 26th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7027)|
| 1:57:09| whereas we would vote on the appointments to these offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7029)|
| 1:57:13| Again, I want to put down that these are for the four countywide offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7033)|
| 1:57:17| I'm not seeking to have the commission candidates for appointment interview with all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7037)|
| 1:57:24| I think that would be a very cumbersome process and time consuming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7044)|
| 1:57:29| But I do think we should have public hearings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7049)|
| 1:57:32| where we allow people interested in those countywide offices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7052)|
| 1:57:35| to come before us in a workshop or a public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7055)|
| 1:57:39| And I am correct in saying that we can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7059)|
| 1:57:41| under the charter law and state of Tennessee law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7061)|
| 1:57:44| can put together such a process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7064)|
| 1:57:46| Correct, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7066)|
| 1:57:47| You can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7067)|
| 1:57:48| And as part of your substitute motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7068)|
| 1:57:51| you're also incorporating the provisions in the charter and our rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7071)|
| 1:57:55| as far as making the appointments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7075)|
| 1:57:57| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7077)|
| 1:57:58| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7078)|
| 1:58:00| And I will seek a second and then explain why I'm doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7080)|
| 1:58:06| I'll second this motion and get it on the floor for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7086)|
| 1:58:08| Thank you, Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7088)|
| 1:58:10| Again, as Commissioner Smith pointed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7090)|
| 1:58:14| I think there does need to be some level of public scrutiny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7094)|
| 1:58:17| Ultimately, the decision will be ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7097)|
| 1:58:19| While a public plebiscite would be helpful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7099)|
| 1:58:22| I think it does come at a cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7102)|
| 1:58:24| where we could probably do it through public hearings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7104)|
| 1:58:27| and get feedback from the community on these four countywide spots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7107)|
| 1:58:32| I think public hearings are necessary for this very reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7112)|
| 1:58:36| that the credibility of our county government has come under question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7116)|
| 1:58:40| over these last nine months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7120)|
| 1:58:43| The idea that maybe backroom deals have been done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7123)|
| 1:58:45| and so on and so forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7125)|
| 1:58:47| has certainly brought that credibility into further scrutiny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7127)|
| 1:58:50| While I do not acknowledge or know of any specific deals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7130)|
| 1:58:54| and I'm not speaking on behalf of any candidates for these offices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7134)|
| 1:58:58| I'm just simply stating this is a way in which we can restore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7138)|
| 1:59:01| some credibility and transparency to this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7141)|
| 1:59:05| and credibility to our government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7145)|
| 1:59:07| while staying within state law and charter law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7147)|
| 1:59:10| Okay. Commissioner Pinkson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7150)|
| 1:59:14| I think we're having input in this through the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7154)|
| 1:59:17| Every commissioner that is being ousted up here is having a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7157)|
| 1:59:21| I feel like every district here knows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7161)|
| 1:59:24| what the people in their district want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7164)|
| 1:59:26| the commissioners here in their district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7166)|
| 1:59:28| I see no reason to change these rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7168)|
| 1:59:31| We're not supporting Supreme Court justices here for life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7171)|
| 1:59:35| We're appointing people to the next election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7175)|
| 1:59:38| We need to save this county, like I said, all the money we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7178)|
| 1:59:42| The people are not being disenfranchised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7182)|
| 1:59:44| because I don't know about the fourth district up there, Mr. Goodenant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7184)|
| 1:59:49| or the second either,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7189)|
| 1:59:52| but the ninth district is well represented, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7192)|
| 1:59:55| by the vote we got and I feel like the people trust us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7195)|
| 1:59:58| to make the right decisions and I think we should do this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7198)|
| 2:00:02| because this is our job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7202)|
| 2:00:04| What are we going to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7204)|
| 2:00:05| Every time we come up on a tough issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7205)|
| 2:00:07| are we going to notify Jamie Haygood and Senator Burchett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7207)|
| 2:00:12| Jamie Woodson, let me correct that, Senator Woodson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7212)|
| 2:00:15| and Burchett to make the decision for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7215)|
| 2:00:18| If you don't, let me tell you something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7218)|
| 2:00:20| There's four people on this commission right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7220)|
| 2:00:23| that the people corrected in the last election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7223)|
| 2:00:26| that have been elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7226)|
| 2:00:28| Have faith in the people and the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7228)|
| 2:00:30| This is the process we're supposed to follow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7230)|
| 2:00:32| and the election is a process the people follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7232)|
| 2:00:35| I just think we need to do what the law says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7235)|
| 2:00:38| and have faith in the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7238)|
| 2:00:39| If we appoint anybody, they can vote them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7239)|
| 2:00:42| That has happened before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7242)|
| 2:00:43| We appointed a judge here not too long ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7243)|
| 2:00:46| and the people corrected us at the post.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7246)|
| 2:00:48| That's all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7248)|
| 2:00:51| Okay, Commissioner Ballard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7251)|
| 2:00:53| A point of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7253)|
| 2:00:55| I think Mark Harmon made a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7255)|
| 2:00:58| or was he, in fact, making a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7258)|
| 2:01:03| Secondly, John, I think, sort of went along with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7263)|
| 2:01:07| except to lead out the non-binding referendum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7267)|
| 2:01:11| Who's got a motion on the floor today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7271)|
| 2:01:13| Commissioner Smith's motion is on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7273)|
| 2:01:15| He has a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7275)|
| 2:01:18| Does Mark have one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7278)|
| 2:01:19| No, not right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7279)|
| 2:01:20| We'd have to vote on the substitute motion first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7280)|
| 2:01:24| If his fails, then we go back to mine and vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7284)|
| 2:01:29| Are you done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7289)|
| 2:01:31| Okay, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7291)|
| 2:01:33| Commissioner Smith, I like what I was hearing there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7293)|
| 2:01:37| Give me the time for the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7297)|
| 2:01:39| Here's your timetable again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7299)|
| 2:01:40| I've got some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7300)|
| 2:01:41| I'm going to go back and ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7301)|
| 2:01:42| Nothing set in stone here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7302)|
| 2:01:43| To put some dates there, I put as a request for interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7303)|
| 2:01:49| Let's term it that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7309)|
| 2:01:50| A request for interest into the four county-wide offices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7310)|
| 2:01:53| of sheriff, trustee, clerk, and registered deans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7313)|
| 2:01:56| the 5th of February,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7316)|
| 2:01:58| which then would allow for commissioners to be sent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7318)|
| 2:02:02| any material that was sent in, copies of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7322)|
| 2:02:06| and then direct the chairman to set a time for a public hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7326)|
| 2:02:13| that would occur sometime between the 5th of February| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7333)|
| 2:02:17| and, I apologize, the 19th, or excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7337)|
| 2:02:24| sometime after the 5th of February| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7344)|
| 2:02:26| but before our next scheduled county commission meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7346)|
| 2:02:29| of the 26th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7349)|
| 2:02:31| I presume that he would probably do so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7351)|
| 2:02:33| a little bit before that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7353)|
| 2:02:34| And then once that public hearing has been held| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7354)|
| 2:02:37| that we would have a special call meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7357)|
| 2:02:40| set by the chairman of the county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7360)|
| 2:02:42| sometime before the 26th regularly scheduled commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7362)|
| 2:02:46| Therefore, anybody we appoint will begin service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7366)|
| 2:02:49| the 26th of February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7369)|
| 2:02:51| Excuse me, they will attend their first meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7371)|
| 2:02:53| the 26th of February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7373)|
| 2:02:55| Does that help?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7375)|
| 2:02:56| Yeah, that's for the four offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7376)|
| 2:02:58| What was your plan for the county commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7378)|
| 2:03:00| My plan for the county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7380)|
| 2:03:01| is they would be appointed that same day of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7381)|
| 2:03:04| Were you going to hold public meetings for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7384)|
| 2:03:05| Not for that, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7385)|
| 2:03:06| I think that is a cumbersome process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7386)|
| 2:03:08| It may require too much time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7388)|
| 2:03:10| And I will just leave it to the discretion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7390)|
| 2:03:13| of the district commissioners to decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7393)|
| 2:03:15| if they want to have public meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7395)|
| 2:03:17| and go about how they choose their nominees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7397)|
| 2:03:20| Mr. Chairman, I don't know if you've got a hard job to do here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7400)|
| 2:03:24| If we do come up and say what Mr. Harmon was saying over there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7404)|
| 2:03:28| that he wants to go back into the committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7408)|
| 2:03:30| I would hope that, and I'm assuming they will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7410)|
| 2:03:31| they'll let the rest of us know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7411)|
| 2:03:33| so we can attend these meetings also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7413)|
| 2:03:35| and be there so we can help formulate our opinions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7415)|
| 2:03:38| Because, just like what he said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7418)|
| 2:03:39| it's going to come back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7419)|
| 2:03:41| We're going to be the ones to make the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7421)|
| 2:03:43| You know, commissioners, I'm proud to be a commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7423)|
| 2:03:46| I worked hard to get to this position where I'm at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7426)|
| 2:03:49| And I want the public to be viewed as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7429)|
| 2:03:52| and know what we're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7432)|
| 2:03:54| that we're doing the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7434)|
| 2:03:56| I don't want the perception as, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7436)|
| 2:03:57| we're just going to get everybody's this or that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7437)|
| 2:03:59| I'll hold my head up and say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7439)|
| 2:04:00| that's the right person for the right job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7440)|
| 2:04:02| and I want it to be above board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7442)|
| 2:04:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7444)|
| 2:04:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7445)|
| 2:04:06| Commissioner Grease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7446)|
| 2:04:08| Mr. Schmidt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7448)|
| 2:04:11| you make it sound like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7451)|
| 2:04:13| that commissioners in each district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7453)|
| 2:04:16| are the exclusive nominators of replacement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7456)|
| 2:04:19| Is that how you see that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7459)|
| 2:04:20| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7460)|
| 2:04:21| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7461)|
| 2:04:22| I'm not trying to specifically address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7462)|
| 2:04:24| how the seats for commission are nominated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7464)|
| 2:04:29| It's specific to charter and state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7469)|
| 2:04:31| And I believe anyone can make that nomination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7471)|
| 2:04:33| My point is in your motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7473)|
| 2:04:34| and I think it would be incumbent for anybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7474)|
| 2:04:36| who wanted to be on any commission seat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7476)|
| 2:04:38| to make sure every commissioner knew it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7478)|
| 2:04:39| not just the commissioners in the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7479)|
| 2:04:41| If you want me to amend it to include,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7481)|
| 2:04:44| are you asking that commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7484)|
| 2:04:47| potential commission nominees be included| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7487)|
| 2:04:49| in the public meetings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7489)|
| 2:04:51| I'll let you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7491)|
| 2:04:52| It's your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7492)|
| 2:04:53| You can play with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7493)|
| 2:04:54| But if anybody can nominate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7494)|
| 2:04:55| and can nominations come from the floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7495)|
| 2:04:56| or only from commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7496)|
| 2:04:58| Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7498)|
| 2:05:00| By state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7500)|
| 2:05:01| nominations may come from the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7501)|
| 2:05:03| Our charter provides that nominations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7503)|
| 2:05:06| may be made by members of the commission only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7506)|
| 2:05:08| that is out of line with the Constitution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7508)|
| 2:05:11| not the Constitution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7511)|
| 2:05:13| that is out of line with state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7513)|
| 2:05:15| We would adhere to state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7515)|
| 2:05:18| It is also in our commission rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7518)|
| 2:05:20| that perhaps why it is there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7520)|
| 2:05:23| is because our charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7523)|
| 2:05:25| is at least out of line with state law there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7525)|
| 2:05:27| By our commission rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7527)|
| 2:05:28| we may nominate our persons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7528)|
| 2:05:31| Citizens may nominate persons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7531)|
| 2:05:33| to fill vacancies in office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7533)|
| 2:05:36| That tells me that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7536)|
| 2:05:38| if you're going to have a public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7538)|
| 2:05:40| it ought to be for all the candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7540)|
| 2:05:42| Nominations can come from the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7542)|
| 2:05:45| My public forum was for those four countywide offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7545)|
| 2:05:48| We're not bound by what's done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7548)|
| 2:05:51| in that public forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7551)|
| 2:05:52| or by if anybody even attends the public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7552)|
| 2:05:55| It's against state and charter law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7555)|
| 2:05:57| My purpose of a public forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7557)|
| 2:06:00| is that I would think anybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7560)|
| 2:06:02| who's nominated for one of these four countywide offices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7562)|
| 2:06:05| who came the day of the appointments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7565)|
| 2:06:08| and was not included in the public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7568)|
| 2:06:12| while they have every legal right to nominate them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7572)|
| 2:06:15| and they may be voted in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7575)|
| 2:06:16| that's fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7576)|
| 2:06:17| but the electorate will see it for what it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7577)|
| 2:06:19| an attempt to get around any public scrutiny| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7579)|
| 2:06:22| and put these people in office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7582)|
| 2:06:24| That may very well be an issue in the next election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7584)|
| 2:06:26| and we'll let the public sort all that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7586)|
| 2:06:28| As for the county commission vacancies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7588)|
| 2:06:31| I just don't want to get into an eight-hour public meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7591)|
| 2:06:34| I think that may be difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7594)|
| 2:06:36| If someone wants to nominate somebody for my seat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7596)|
| 2:06:39| outside of the two district representatives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7599)|
| 2:06:41| Mr. Good and myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7601)|
| 2:06:42| they have every right to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7602)|
| 2:06:44| And if that nominee is felt to be more qualified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7604)|
| 2:06:47| than the ones we nominate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7607)|
| 2:06:48| then that's your prerogative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7608)|
| 2:06:50| But I don't feel that there's a necessary need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7610)|
| 2:06:54| to add the commission nominees into that public meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7614)|
| 2:06:58| It sounds to me like just in general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7618)|
| 2:06:59| there could be a lot of nominees for each position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7619)|
| 2:07:02| For those four positions, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7622)|
| 2:07:04| And also for county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7624)|
| 2:07:05| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7625)|
| 2:07:06| And I can tell you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7626)|
| 2:07:08| I hope to hold a public meeting if time allows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7628)|
| 2:07:11| and I don't think the 31st is a good day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7631)|
| 2:07:13| so I'm hoping the chairman will change that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7633)|
| 2:07:15| for this substitute motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7635)|
| 2:07:17| to allow people who are interested in my seat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7637)|
| 2:07:19| to come and explain in front of the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7639)|
| 2:07:21| why they should do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7641)|
| 2:07:23| Does that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7643)|
| 2:07:25| I'm just concerned that you're...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7645)|
| 2:07:27| It answers my question, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7647)|
| 2:07:29| I'm just looking for transparency and openness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7649)|
| 2:07:30| and public scrutiny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7650)|
| 2:07:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7652)|
| 2:07:33| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7653)|
| 2:07:34| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7654)|
| 2:07:35| If I'm reading the room correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7655)|
| 2:07:36| there doesn't seem to be majority support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7656)|
| 2:07:39| for public hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7659)|
| 2:07:41| But I would hope that there would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7661)|
| 2:07:42| majority support for a public process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7662)|
| 2:07:45| All of us, when we sought public office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7665)|
| 2:07:47| we made it public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7667)|
| 2:07:48| We let it be known| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7668)|
| 2:07:49| that we wanted to run for these positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7669)|
| 2:07:52| I think at the very least| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7672)|
| 2:07:53| we should have a process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7673)|
| 2:07:55| a public process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7675)|
| 2:07:56| where individuals who are interested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7676)|
| 2:07:57| in a commission seat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7677)|
| 2:07:58| or a constitutional office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7678)|
| 2:08:00| will let that be known formally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7680)|
| 2:08:02| so that the public will know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7682)|
| 2:08:03| who these individuals are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7683)|
| 2:08:05| that they are interested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7685)|
| 2:08:06| and have it out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7686)|
| 2:08:09| I would hate that we would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7689)|
| 2:08:11| and it's possible according to our rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7691)|
| 2:08:13| that we would gather here on January 31st| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7693)|
| 2:08:15| and individuals would be elected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7695)|
| 2:08:17| or appointed to these commission seats| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7697)|
| 2:08:19| or to the constitutional offices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7699)|
| 2:08:21| and the public have no idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7701)|
| 2:08:23| who these people are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7703)|
| 2:08:24| I think that this is the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7704)|
| 2:08:25| we followed when we were elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7705)|
| 2:08:27| We actually went out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7707)|
| 2:08:28| and got petitions signed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7708)|
| 2:08:29| We did the forums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7709)|
| 2:08:30| We answered the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7710)|
| 2:08:32| We knocked on the doors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7712)|
| 2:08:33| They will not be required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7713)|
| 2:08:34| to do any of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7714)|
| 2:08:35| I think at the very least| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7715)|
| 2:08:36| they should be asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7716)|
| 2:08:37| to let it be known publicly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7717)|
| 2:08:39| so that we can have a list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7719)|
| 2:08:41| and present that list to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7721)|
| 2:08:43| Now, whether we have public hearings or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7723)|
| 2:08:45| again, my sense of reading the room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7725)|
| 2:08:47| is that there's not majority support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7727)|
| 2:08:49| for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7729)|
| 2:08:50| But I do believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7730)|
| 2:08:51| that there is a majority support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7731)|
| 2:08:52| for a public process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7732)|
| 2:08:54| so that these individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7734)|
| 2:08:55| have been identified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7735)|
| 2:08:56| and if someone comes up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7736)|
| 2:08:57| at the 11th hour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7737)|
| 2:08:58| then so be it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7738)|
| 2:09:00| There's nothing to prevent that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7740)|
| 2:09:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7742)|
| 2:09:03| Commissioner Leuthold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7743)|
| 2:09:04| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7744)|
| 2:09:06| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7746)|
| 2:09:08| We do need to have a process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7748)|
| 2:09:09| It needs to be transparent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7749)|
| 2:09:11| I think we need to hear from the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7751)|
| 2:09:15| Commissioner Schmidt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7755)|
| 2:09:16| just throwing out an idea here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7756)|
| 2:09:18| real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7758)|
| 2:09:20| The chairman has already asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7760)|
| 2:09:23| for a special meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7763)|
| 2:09:24| on the 31st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7764)|
| 2:09:25| What if we use that day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7765)|
| 2:09:27| to hear from those seeking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7767)|
| 2:09:29| the countywide offices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7769)|
| 2:09:32| and then maybe have our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7772)|
| 2:09:34| postponed actual appointment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7774)|
| 2:09:37| of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7777)|
| 2:09:40| until about one week later| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7780)|
| 2:09:41| to the 7th of February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7781)|
| 2:09:44| That will give every district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7784)|
| 2:09:46| a chance to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7786)|
| 2:09:47| if they so wish,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7787)|
| 2:09:48| to have some type| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7788)|
| 2:09:50| of meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7790)|
| 2:09:52| for those commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7792)|
| 2:09:54| to meet the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7794)|
| 2:09:55| of their district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7795)|
| 2:09:56| and give us also time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7796)|
| 2:10:00| to sunshine those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7800)|
| 2:10:01| because I'm sure we'll have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7801)|
| 2:10:02| to sunshine anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7802)|
| 2:10:03| that we do like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7803)|
| 2:10:05| So would that process be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7805)|
| 2:10:09| I appreciate the suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7809)|
| 2:10:12| The 31st is what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7812)|
| 2:10:13| a week from this Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7813)|
| 2:10:14| You're talking the 7th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7814)|
| 2:10:17| being a week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7817)|
| 2:10:18| two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7818)|
| 2:10:19| It would be two weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7819)|
| 2:10:20| from this Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7820)|
| 2:10:21| Here's my thinking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7821)|
| 2:10:23| reasoning on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7823)|
| 2:10:24| My reasoning is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7824)|
| 2:10:26| to have the new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7826)|
| 2:10:28| office holders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7828)|
| 2:10:30| be in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7830)|
| 2:10:31| for the regularly scheduled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7831)|
| 2:10:32| February meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7832)|
| 2:10:34| That allows us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7834)|
| 2:10:36| considerable time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7836)|
| 2:10:38| to request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7838)|
| 2:10:40| those interested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7840)|
| 2:10:41| to let us know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7841)|
| 2:10:42| It allows considerable time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7842)|
| 2:10:44| for public hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7844)|
| 2:10:45| and also for public hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7845)|
| 2:10:47| should commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7847)|
| 2:10:48| want to conduct those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7848)|
| 2:10:49| in their own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7849)|
| 2:10:50| individual districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7850)|
| 2:10:51| and still gets us in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7851)|
| 2:10:54| by that February the 26th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7854)|
| 2:10:56| So I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7856)|
| 2:10:57| a two week process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7857)|
| 2:10:58| it also allows for media| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7858)|
| 2:10:59| to maybe print| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7859)|
| 2:11:01| any interviews| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7861)|
| 2:11:02| or analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7862)|
| 2:11:04| of these nominees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7864)|
| 2:11:05| So I'd like to stick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7865)|
| 2:11:07| with just a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7867)|
| 2:11:08| further drawn out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7868)|
| 2:11:09| process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7869)|
| 2:11:10| I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7870)|
| 2:11:11| with the ultimate goal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7871)|
| 2:11:13| of getting these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7873)|
| 2:11:14| office holders in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7874)|
| 2:11:15| by the 26th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7875)|
| 2:11:16| I would stick to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7876)|
| 2:11:17| allowing a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7877)|
| 2:11:18| more time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7878)|

| 2:11:20| let us know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7880)|
| 2:11:21| their interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7881)|
| 2:11:22| and then let the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7882)|
| 2:11:23| chairman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7883)|

| 2:11:25| those border dates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7885)|
| 2:11:26| I gave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7886)|
| 2:11:27| select times for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7887)|
| 2:11:28| public hearings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7888)|
| 2:11:29| and a special call meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7889)|
| 2:11:30| I was trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7890)|
| 2:11:31| come up with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7891)|
| 2:11:32| something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7892)|
| 2:11:33| since we already have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7893)|
| 2:11:34| a called meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7894)|
| 2:11:35| for the 31st| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7895)|
| 2:11:36| I felt like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7896)|
| 2:11:37| that was something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7897)|
| 2:11:38| we could go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7898)|
| 2:11:39| and do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7899)|
| 2:11:40| There's been so much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7900)|
| 2:11:41| going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7901)|
| 2:11:42| and I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7902)|
| 2:11:44| it's important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7904)|
| 2:11:45| for people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7905)|
| 2:11:46| if they want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7906)|
| 2:11:47| submit written| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7907)|
| 2:11:48| materials especially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7908)|
| 2:11:49| to give that to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7909)|

| 2:11:51| disseminated to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7911)|
| 2:11:52| the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7912)|
| 2:11:53| So I don't think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7913)|
| 2:11:54| a week does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7914)|
| 2:11:55| with all due respect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7915)|
| 2:11:56| to the chairman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7916)|
| 2:11:57| I think the 31st| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7917)|
| 2:11:58| under this proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7918)|
| 2:11:59| there would be no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7919)|
| 2:12:00| need for a special| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7920)|
| 2:12:01| call meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7921)|
| 2:12:02| on the 31st| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7922)|
| 2:12:03| he would simply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7923)|
| 2:12:04| call one between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7924)|

| 2:12:12| just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7932)|
| 2:12:13| the 31st| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7933)|
| 2:12:14| day because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7934)|
| 2:12:15| the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7935)|

| 2:12:17| to me for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7937)|
| 2:12:18| special call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070122?start=7938)|
