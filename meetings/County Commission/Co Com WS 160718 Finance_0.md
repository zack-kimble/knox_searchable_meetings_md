| 0:00:00| Chris, the finance director for the county, with his report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=0)|
| 0:00:06| Thank you for being here, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=6)|
| 0:00:10| My pleasure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=10)|
| 0:00:12| Chris Caldwell, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=12)|
| 0:00:15| I handed out just a little three-page FY16 budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=15)|
| 0:00:22| overview that I wanted to go over with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=22)|
| 0:00:24| all to just kind of show you how budget works from our standpoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=24)|
| 0:00:30| and how we get from an adopted budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=30)|
| 0:00:34| to what we call a revised budget and what makes that up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=34)|
| 0:00:37| and how that is compared to revenue and expenditures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=37)|
| 0:00:42| and how we are projecting to end the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=42)|
| 0:00:46| And so we'll get into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=46)|
| 0:00:48| Your first page, which is just entitled FY16 budget overview,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=48)|
| 0:00:53| we simply just look at the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=53)|
| 0:00:56| You'll see an adopted budget of $174,249,100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=56)|
| 0:01:05| Then you see a list of items, such as designations, reserves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=65)|
| 0:01:11| or other appropriations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=71)|
| 0:01:13| This also includes the rolling over of encumbrances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=73)|
| 0:01:17| from year to year, which covers those budget items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=77)|
| 0:01:21| That's about $6.4 million for a total revised budget of $180.7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=81)|
| 0:01:27| So that kind of gives you an idea of where we get to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=87)|
| 0:01:30| and how we get to a revised budget total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=90)|
| 0:01:33| If you came and if you come see me tomorrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=93)|
| 0:01:37| that revised budget may change because there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=97)|
| 0:01:39| are certain line items that we estimate and appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=99)|
| 0:01:42| as we get money in and as we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=102)|
| 0:01:45| And so that is what makes those up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=105)|
| 0:01:50| I'll go on to page two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=110)|
| 0:01:53| We basically call this a budget analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=113)|
| 0:01:56| And I just want to kind of go over this with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=116)|
| 0:01:59| as you look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=119)|
| 0:01:59| So you know the adopted budget for 16 was the $174,249,100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=119)|
| 0:02:06| On the revenue side of things, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=126)|
| 0:02:07| is the first piece on page two, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=127)|
| 0:02:11| is made up of anticipated revenues of $169,249,100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=131)|
| 0:02:19| We also anticipated using fund balance of $5 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=139)|
| 0:02:23| to get back to a total budget that was adopted of the $174.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=143)|
| 0:02:28| On the expenditure side of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=148)|
| 0:02:30| we anticipated expending the whole budget of $174,249,100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=150)|
| 0:02:37| But also, after that budget was adopted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=157)|
| 0:02:40| the mayor brought forth and the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=160)|
| 0:02:43| approved designations, reserves, and things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=163)|
| 0:02:47| like that of that $6.4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=167)|
| 0:02:49| So we really, from a budget standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=169)|
| 0:02:52| would look to spend $180,695,058.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=172)|
| 0:02:59| So if all that happened, we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=179)|
| 0:03:03| have a deficiency on the year of a little over $11 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=183)|
| 0:03:08| So once you take the adopted budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=188)|
| 0:03:12| bring over your designations and your reserves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=192)|
| 0:03:16| and carry over your encumbrances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=196)|
| 0:03:18| if all that played out true to form,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=198)|
| 0:03:21| we would have reduced our fund balance from $69.7 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=201)|
| 0:03:26| down to $58.3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=206)|
| 0:03:28| OK, that's just budget to budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=208)|
| 0:03:31| How we project to end the year is as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=211)|
| 0:03:38| Through last week, we had received in $170,800,698| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=218)|
| 0:03:48| in revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=228)|
| 0:03:49| We project to get accounts receivable of about $7.5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=229)|
| 0:03:56| million, which would bring our total revenue for FY16| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=236)|
| 0:04:01| to a little over $178 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=241)|
| 0:04:05| On the expenditure side, expenditures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=245)|
| 0:04:07| to date as of last week was a little shy of $174.8 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=247)|
| 0:04:14| We think that we may accrue additional expenditures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=254)|
| 0:04:18| of about $1.2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=258)|
| 0:04:20| So we think our total expenses may be approximately $176| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=260)|
| 0:04:26| million, which would lead to a budget surplus of a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=266)|
| 0:04:30| over $2.2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=270)|
| 0:04:34| Now, that's just a very early projection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=274)|
| 0:04:39| We anticipate getting haul income tax probably next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=279)|
| 0:04:44| And that will play a big part on what our AR really comes in at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=284)|
| 0:04:50| And likewise, we'll go through our other budgeted funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=290)|
| 0:04:54| and internal service funds and try to, what we would call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=294)|
| 0:04:58| true those budgets up and see how they have done year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=298)|
| 0:05:03| to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=303)|
| 0:05:04| We've had some high expenditures on health insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=304)|
| 0:05:11| We know we have some employee benefit expenses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=311)|
| 0:05:19| that will come due from the standpoint of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=319)|
| 0:05:22| if we're not hitting our discount rate of 7.5%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=322)|
| 0:05:27| we know that our ARC runs the risk of going up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=327)|
| 0:05:31| And so that's where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=331)|
| 0:05:34| Some people would then ask, OK, Chris,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=334)|
| 0:05:37| what leads to your budget surplus of $2.2 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=337)|
| 0:05:43| The point that I would make, if you go from page two to three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=343)|
| 0:05:46| we really anticipated using a little over $11 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=346)|
| 0:05:52| in fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=352)|
| 0:05:53| We're coming out $2.2 to the good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=353)|
| 0:05:55| So that's about a $13 million swing to the good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=355)|
| 0:06:01| So it's been a really good year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=361)|
| 0:06:04| We get there from this standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=364)|
| 0:06:07| I'll just run through a few of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=367)|
| 0:06:09| Currently, we're beating budget on business tax by $900,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=369)|
| 0:06:16| The excise tax on banks by $285,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=376)|
| 0:06:20| Health department revenue, another $900,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=380)|
| 0:06:23| County clerk excess fees, $500,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=383)|
| 0:06:27| Register of deeds excess fees, $100,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=387)|
| 0:06:30| Trustees excess fees, $500,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=390)|
| 0:06:33| Criminal court clerk excess fees, $300,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=393)|
| 0:06:37| In lieu of taxes from KUB by $750,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=397)|
| 0:06:41| And the big piece would be the $2.7 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=401)|
| 0:06:44| that we received from the criminal court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=404)|
| 0:06:47| clerk on the partial payments that we found during the audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=407)|
| 0:06:51| And so that's what makes those totals up on the revenue side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=411)|
| 0:06:55| On the expenditure side, we spend about 97% of expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=415)|
| 0:07:00| And so that's what makes that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=420)|
| 0:07:01| So you can pound those things together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=421)|
| 0:07:03| and you get to that budget surplus number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=423)|
| 0:07:08| That is all I have, unless you have any questions for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=428)|
| 0:07:20| I guess not, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=440)|
| 0:07:21| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=441)|
| 0:07:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=441)|
| 0:07:26| Next, Buzz Thomas, superintendent of schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=446)|
| 0:07:28| He'll give the financial report for the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=448)|
| 0:07:33| Welcome, Buzz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=453)|
| 0:07:35| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=455)|
| 0:07:36| And thank you, members of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=456)|
| 0:07:39| Buzz Thomas, 912 South Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=459)|
| 0:07:42| We have a strong team working on school finances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=462)|
| 0:07:46| have had a great team this year, and are especially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=466)|
| 0:07:50| grateful for the partnership that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=470)|
| 0:07:53| has developed between our office and your office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=473)|
| 0:07:56| on school finance, starting with the MOU| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=476)|
| 0:08:01| more than a year ago between the mayor and the superintendent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=481)|
| 0:08:04| and continuing up until the present time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=484)|
| 0:08:07| I especially want to thank Chris Caldwell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=487)|
| 0:08:11| for the tremendous work that he has done with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=491)|
| 0:08:15| in building this partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=495)|
| 0:08:17| And we look forward to a very productive year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=497)|
| 0:08:20| We have a good report to give you today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=500)|
| 0:08:23| and are excited about our quest to create the best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=503)|
| 0:08:27| schools in the South.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=507)|
| 0:08:29| We don't want Knoxville just to be a place people visit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=509)|
| 0:08:32| We want Knox County to be a place where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=512)|
| 0:08:35| you want to move your family and enroll your kids in schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=515)|
| 0:08:39| and locate your business, because we've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=519)|
| 0:08:41| the best schools in the South.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=521)|
| 0:08:43| So I'm going to turn to our assistant superintendent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=523)|
| 0:08:47| for finance, Bob Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=527)|
| 0:08:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=530)|
| 0:08:51| Good evening, commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=531)|
| 0:08:52| And I appreciate you giving me the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=532)|
| 0:08:54| to give you an overview about the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=534)|
| 0:08:56| Of course, we're in the process of close out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=536)|
| 0:08:58| It's Bob Thomas, 9211 South Gay Street, Andrew Johnson Building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=538)|
| 0:09:03| And we've given you, I think, a two or three page handout there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=543)|
| 0:09:08| if you could refer to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=548)|
| 0:09:10| I'll try to hit some highlights there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=550)|
| 0:09:12| We've also, as Mr. Thomas mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=552)|
| 0:09:15| got a strong finance staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=555)|
| 0:09:17| Mr. Gary Spencer is here with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=557)|
| 0:09:19| He's our executive director of finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=559)|
| 0:09:20| And then also Chris Simons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=560)|
| 0:09:22| Chris is our accounting supervisor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=562)|
| 0:09:25| So let me make a few points here about the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=565)|
| 0:09:31| We changed the format just a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=571)|
| 0:09:32| It's more in the format of the cap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=572)|
| 0:09:35| or what you're used to seeing at the end of the year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=575)|
| 0:09:39| when the books close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=579)|
| 0:09:40| And this, by the way, is a new format.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=580)|
| 0:09:43| And this, by the way, as Chris mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=583)|
| 0:09:46| is sort of a moving target at this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=586)|
| 0:09:48| because there are still things that are not closed out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=588)|
| 0:09:52| officially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=592)|
| 0:09:52| But this is our best estimate at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=592)|
| 0:09:55| So if you look at page one of two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=595)|
| 0:09:58| there that's broken down into several different areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=598)|
| 0:10:01| revenue being first and expenditures underneath that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=601)|
| 0:10:05| is the major categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=605)|
| 0:10:06| I'd like to talk with you just about those two areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=606)|
| 0:10:09| And then if you've got further questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=609)|
| 0:10:11| I'll try to address those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=611)|
| 0:10:13| In looking at local option sales taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=613)|
| 0:10:15| under revenue under local taxes, things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=615)|
| 0:10:18| look really, really good at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=618)|
| 0:10:21| We're anticipating on a very conservative estimate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=621)|
| 0:10:24| about $4.9 million in excess over what was budgeted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=624)|
| 0:10:29| So again, that's very favorable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=629)|
| 0:10:32| We used a conservative estimate that quite possibly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=632)|
| 0:10:34| could be a little bit higher than that, which again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=634)|
| 0:10:37| would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=637)|
| 0:10:40| If you look under other local sources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=640)|
| 0:10:43| the next subtitle there, in other county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=643)|
| 0:10:48| the revenue is a favorable variance there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=648)|
| 0:10:51| It's primarily due to indirect costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=651)|
| 0:10:54| charged to other school funds like federal projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=654)|
| 0:10:57| general projects, and central cafeteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=657)|
| 0:11:00| So we exceeded the budget there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=660)|
| 0:11:04| If you look under state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=664)|
| 0:11:06| another very favorable variance for BEP revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=666)|
| 0:11:12| Last year, when we received our June estimate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=672)|
| 0:11:17| we actually, in July, got a bump over the June estimate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=677)|
| 0:11:20| by about $1.6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=680)|
| 0:11:23| That remained unbudgeted at that point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=683)|
| 0:11:26| The thought process there was not to budget that money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=686)|
| 0:11:29| but to use it to allow it to close into fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=689)|
| 0:11:34| Because again, part of the MOU that we signed with the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=694)|
| 0:11:39| was to try to build back fund balance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=699)|
| 0:11:41| so that it would be equal to month of payroll, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=701)|
| 0:11:46| So again, about $1.6 million favorable there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=706)|
| 0:11:51| And other state revenue, an unfavorable variance there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=711)|
| 0:11:54| And the reason for that is because career ladder program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=714)|
| 0:11:58| the state is phasing out career ladder program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=718)|
| 0:12:01| There are still employees who we receive money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=721)|
| 0:12:03| for career ladder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=723)|
| 0:12:05| But as those employees retire, resign, whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=725)|
| 0:12:08| the state slowly, gradually, will decrease those funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=728)|
| 0:12:12| where eventually there will be no career ladder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=732)|
| 0:12:15| funds that will pass through from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=735)|
| 0:12:22| Under expenditures, if you look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=742)|
| 0:12:31| personal services, again, an unfavorable variance there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=751)|
| 0:12:37| Under personal services, the reason for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=757)|
| 0:12:41| we had about $1.5 million in unbudgeted positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=761)|
| 0:12:45| Primarily, those positions went to schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=765)|
| 0:12:48| in the way of 17 teaching positions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=768)|
| 0:12:51| four assistant principals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=771)|
| 0:12:53| The shift in populations with the students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=773)|
| 0:12:55| usually every year we see that, where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=775)|
| 0:12:58| we miss the enrollment projections a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=778)|
| 0:13:00| plus or minus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=780)|
| 0:13:01| So generally speaking, there are some additions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=781)|
| 0:13:04| after the budget is approved and at the beginning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=784)|
| 0:13:07| of the school year, again, based on enrollment changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=787)|
| 0:13:12| Also, substitute teacher costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=792)|
| 0:13:15| Last year, if you recall, we have a tier system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=795)|
| 0:13:19| with substitute teachers, depending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=799)|
| 0:13:21| on what day of the week a teacher is absent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=801)|
| 0:13:24| also depending on the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=804)|
| 0:13:26| Some schools have a little bit of a difficulty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=806)|
| 0:13:29| in terms of getting substitutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=809)|
| 0:13:30| so we've got a different pay structure, where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=810)|
| 0:13:33| we pay a little bit more for substitutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=813)|
| 0:13:35| to go to those schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=815)|
| 0:13:38| So again, that's what the unfavorable variance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=818)|
| 0:13:41| is due to there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=821)|
| 0:13:43| The next line, payroll taxes and employee benefits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=823)|
| 0:13:46| see an unfavorable variance of about close to $2.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=826)|
| 0:13:52| The reason for that, we were under budgeted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=832)|
| 0:13:54| in medical insurance this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=834)|
| 0:13:57| Part of that is we did some projections for our employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=837)|
| 0:14:01| that we might move from a plan that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=841)|
| 0:14:03| would have been more favorable to the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=843)|
| 0:14:05| and those projections didn't quite hold there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=845)|
| 0:14:08| Plus, there were some unbudgeted positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=848)|
| 0:14:11| So fortunately, we were over budgeted in retirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=851)|
| 0:14:16| and Social Security to the tune of about $1.5 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=856)|
| 0:14:19| so it offset that variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=859)|
| 0:14:21| So again, an unfavorable variance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=861)|
| 0:14:24| there of about $2.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=864)|
| 0:14:26| Supplies and materials, looking further under expenditures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=866)|
| 0:14:31| about a $650,000 favorable variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=871)|
| 0:14:34| That's due to natural gas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=874)|
| 0:14:37| In terms of the winter last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=877)|
| 0:14:40| it was a much milder winter than we've had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=880)|
| 0:14:43| so we were actually able to achieve some savings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=883)|
| 0:14:45| with natural gas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=885)|
| 0:14:47| Natural gas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=887)|
| 0:14:52| Under other uses, workers' compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=892)|
| 0:14:56| Let's see, other uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=896)|
| 0:14:57| The variance, again, unfavorable variance of $257,938,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=897)|
| 0:15:03| primarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=903)|
| 0:15:05| That was due to workers' compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=905)|
| 0:15:07| Insurance was over budgeted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=907)|
| 0:15:09| Then also the trustee commission was a little bit higher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=909)|
| 0:15:12| based on the fact that revenue was higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=912)|
| 0:15:15| And under the last one I'd like to talk about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=915)|
| 0:15:19| I guess, is transfers to other funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=919)|
| 0:15:23| Again, a little bit of an unfavorable variance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=923)|
| 0:15:25| there of $59,000, and that was due to Emerald Academy Charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=925)|
| 0:15:31| School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=931)|
| 0:15:32| We, of course, fund them, and the projected revenues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=932)|
| 0:15:35| were higher, so it was actually an increase to what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=935)|
| 0:15:40| we funded to Emerald Charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=940)|
| 0:15:44| Again, all in all, we're expecting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=944)|
| 0:15:46| to close about $2 million this year into fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=946)|
| 0:15:51| That amount could be higher based on the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=951)|
| 0:15:54| that revenue projections may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=954)|
| 0:15:57| We used a conservative estimate based on the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=957)|
| 0:15:59| that sales taxes are looking really good at this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=959)|
| 0:16:03| in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=963)|
| 0:16:04| Possibly we'll close about $2 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=964)|
| 0:16:07| maybe more into fund balance at the end of when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=967)|
| 0:16:10| the book's closed in a couple of months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=970)|
| 0:16:16| Does anybody have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=976)|
| 0:16:22| Commissioner Buster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=982)|
| 0:16:23| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=983)|
| 0:16:25| Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=985)|
| 0:16:25| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=985)|
| 0:16:27| Can you explain to me one thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=987)|
| 0:16:29| What is an unbudgeted position?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=989)|
| 0:16:32| What we try to do in the budgeting process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=992)|
| 0:16:35| is project our enrollment as closely as we can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=995)|
| 0:16:39| and we'll start that process in this fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=999)|
| 0:16:42| And we will try to add positions to the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1002)|
| 0:16:46| to accommodate the enrollment increases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1006)|
| 0:16:49| Sometimes we don't get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1009)|
| 0:16:53| It's a hard number to try to come up with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1013)|
| 0:16:54| although Mr. Oaks and his department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1014)|
| 0:16:57| do a great job of projecting enrollment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1017)|
| 0:17:00| There's not that much variance when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1020)|
| 0:17:02| you look at it system wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1022)|
| 0:17:04| But in some situations, an additional student,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1024)|
| 0:17:06| or two or three students could create a situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1026)|
| 0:17:09| where we need to add a teacher, or we're out of compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1029)|
| 0:17:13| with teacher-people ratios.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1033)|
| 0:17:15| So it's more of those types of situations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1035)|
| 0:17:17| where the enrollment would be higher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1037)|
| 0:17:19| than what we had projected, and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1039)|
| 0:17:21| would need to hire a teacher to go into that position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1041)|
| 0:17:24| to make sure that we met the teacher-people ratios required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1044)|
| 0:17:28| by the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1048)|
| 0:17:30| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1050)|
| 0:17:30| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1050)|
| 0:17:37| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1057)|
| 0:17:38| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1058)|
| 0:17:52| Next on the agenda is Bill Lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1072)|
| 0:17:55| I asked Mr. Lines to come here and give us a presentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1075)|
| 0:17:58| on TIFs and pilots, because I wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1078)|
| 0:18:00| us to be able to discuss this openly when we didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1080)|
| 0:18:04| have a specific project in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1084)|
| 0:18:08| And I also wanted to get some information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1088)|
| 0:18:12| on how the third-party analysis is coming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1092)|
| 0:18:14| how it's going to be paid for, and how it's going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1094)|
| 0:18:17| So thank you for being here, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1097)|
| 0:18:18| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1098)|
| 0:18:20| If it's OK, what I'd like to do is go through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1100)|
| 0:18:23| And we can either have you all ask questions as I go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1103)|
| 0:18:26| or I could go all the way through and stop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1106)|
| 0:18:28| and we can have Q&A. I'm well aware that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1108)|
| 0:18:30| have some time constraints, so I don't plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1110)|
| 0:18:32| on dwelling on this too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1112)|
| 0:18:34| I do want to present all of this from the point of view| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1114)|
| 0:18:37| of purely county finances and county taxpayers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1117)|
| 0:18:42| not necessarily city and county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1122)|
| 0:18:44| So the figures that I'll be presenting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1124)|
| 0:18:46| will be county taxes only, because that's what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1126)|
| 0:18:49| your focus is, and I think those are the questions that you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1129)|
| 0:18:52| need to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1132)|
| 0:18:53| So let's go ahead and get going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1133)|
| 0:18:57| First, and I want to give a lot of background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1137)|
| 0:18:59| Some of this I've been able to do in some context,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1139)|
| 0:19:02| but we've been sort of rushed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1142)|
| 0:19:03| As Commissioner Chairman Smith said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1143)|
| 0:19:06| this has been in the context of a specific project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1146)|
| 0:19:08| rather than overall what the program is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1148)|
| 0:19:11| So what problem are we solving with these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1151)|
| 0:19:13| is a good place to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1153)|
| 0:19:16| I'm, I guess, the only remaining person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1156)|
| 0:19:18| in the city administration, other than Jim York,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1158)|
| 0:19:21| who's been here, came in with Mayor Haslam| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1161)|
| 0:19:23| when he came in in 2004.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1163)|
| 0:19:25| And when we came in, we really made a concentrated policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1165)|
| 0:19:30| effort that we were going to grow from the inside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1170)|
| 0:19:32| and not grow through annexation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1172)|
| 0:19:35| So we had virtually, in fact, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1175)|
| 0:19:37| no annexation by ordinance other than some scattered parcels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1177)|
| 0:19:42| that were requested at the request of the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1182)|
| 0:19:44| There were maybe a few cleanup lawsuit parcels out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1184)|
| 0:19:48| and as you know, those are long gone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1188)|
| 0:19:49| based on legislative action last year and the year before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1189)|
| 0:19:54| So our policy was grow inward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1194)|
| 0:19:56| And this was really based on a look at the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1196)|
| 0:19:59| that A, there were, it was something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1199)|
| 0:20:02| that was more desired by folks who were there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1202)|
| 0:20:04| and that there were problems in going and bringing people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1204)|
| 0:20:06| into the city, not only with the annexation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1206)|
| 0:20:09| but also with people not necessarily wanting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1209)|
| 0:20:11| more density around them as you got, as you moved outward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1211)|
| 0:20:14| So the advantages of these, I've gone over in many times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1214)|
| 0:20:18| with you, the infrastructure is already paid for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1218)|
| 0:20:21| We've got plenty of underdeveloped land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1221)|
| 0:20:23| And when you looked at the taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1223)|
| 0:20:25| county taxes and city taxes, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1225)|
| 0:20:27| that these undeveloped parcels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1227)|
| 0:20:29| in the core of the city were producing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1229)|
| 0:20:31| it was frighteningly low, abysmally performing parcels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1231)|
| 0:20:34| that were made more of a drain than they added anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1234)|
| 0:20:37| Parcels that many times were quite large| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1237)|
| 0:20:39| in the industrial heartland of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1239)|
| 0:20:41| that were producing fewer taxes than a single family house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1241)|
| 0:20:45| of fairly modest proportions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1245)|
| 0:20:47| So we set up a department of redevelopment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1247)|
| 0:20:50| and that was explicitly rather than development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1250)|
| 0:20:53| And we obviously have development that's occurring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1253)|
| 0:20:55| other than redevelopment to the city as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1255)|
| 0:20:58| but we wanted to concentrate on reuse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1258)|
| 0:21:00| of all of this abandoned property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1260)|
| 0:21:01| and put our growth efforts there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1261)|
| 0:21:04| Now in doing so, and by the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1264)|
| 0:21:06| I want to stop here and say in doing so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1266)|
| 0:21:07| we set up a redevelopment department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1267)|
| 0:21:09| that has grown quite a bit because this effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1269)|
| 0:21:12| has taken on a lot of momentum and worked very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1272)|
| 0:21:15| So I want to make sure everybody knows who those folks are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1275)|
| 0:21:18| Dawn Michelle Foster is our director of redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1278)|
| 0:21:23| Anne Wallace is also, she's the deputy director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1283)|
| 0:21:26| and is largely dealing with Cumberland Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1286)|
| 0:21:28| downtown north, Brownfields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1288)|
| 0:21:30| Rick Emmett is our downtown coordinator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1290)|
| 0:21:32| He's been around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1292)|
| 0:21:33| It's sort of interesting symbolism here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1293)|
| 0:21:35| Rick used to be the annexation guy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1295)|
| 0:21:36| so we decommissioned him from annexation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1296)|
| 0:21:38| and put him over to redevelopment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1298)|
| 0:21:40| to kind of underscore that effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1300)|
| 0:21:43| Then we also have Brian Berry, who's our newest member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1303)|
| 0:21:49| who's going to be concentrated in Magnolia and moving east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1309)|
| 0:21:52| So we set up an entire department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1312)|
| 0:21:55| and the city is structured to do this, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1315)|
| 0:21:56| rather than county government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1316)|
| 0:21:59| So some of the difficulties in doing this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1319)|
| 0:22:02| have to do with the cost, Brownfield conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1322)|
| 0:22:05| higher risk, banks weren't making any loans to projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1325)|
| 0:22:09| they were very difficult and challenging,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1329)|
| 0:22:11| and also we had very few developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1331)|
| 0:22:12| who had at least been interested in doing this kind of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1332)|
| 0:22:15| It was very different from building a box| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1335)|
| 0:22:19| out in the suburbs or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1339)|
| 0:22:20| and it was just a different type of work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1340)|
| 0:22:22| with different sorts of challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1342)|
| 0:22:24| What the result was in coming in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1344)|
| 0:22:26| we had a lot of continued disinvestment over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1346)|
| 0:22:30| So what we have done, and I got a symbol,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1350)|
| 0:22:32| put it on this PowerPoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1352)|
| 0:22:34| but it's obviously not meant to be whatever that exactly is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1354)|
| 0:22:37| I guess that's some kind of a pentagram,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1357)|
| 0:22:40| that's probably not a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1360)|
| 0:22:42| Anyway, what we decided was let's get to the city core,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1362)|
| 0:22:46| underperforming tax base, existing infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1366)|
| 0:22:50| sure school capacity was there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1370)|
| 0:22:53| people did move in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1373)|
| 0:22:53| there was plenty of capacity in the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1373)|
| 0:22:56| there was support for density where in other areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1376)|
| 0:22:59| especially when you get to multifamily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1379)|
| 0:23:00| as a county resident and taxpayer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1380)|
| 0:23:03| and I guess I've been here for almost 40 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1383)|
| 0:23:06| about half that time spent living| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1386)|
| 0:23:07| outside the city and the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1387)|
| 0:23:08| so I certainly have both perspectives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1388)|
| 0:23:11| This was very appropriate for density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1391)|
| 0:23:12| where other areas density was a challenge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1392)|
| 0:23:15| and we could relieve the growth pressures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1395)|
| 0:23:17| Now we heard from Mr. Thomas, from Buzz Thomas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1397)|
| 0:23:23| for the schools talking about we want people to move here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1403)|
| 0:23:24| we know lots of people are moving here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1404)|
| 0:23:26| we know they're all not going to want to move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1406)|
| 0:23:28| to the core of the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1408)|
| 0:23:29| and that's not what we'd ever expect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1409)|
| 0:23:31| but we would like a goodly number of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1411)|
| 0:23:33| especially when we're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1413)|
| 0:23:34| multifamily opportunities associated with the university| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1414)|
| 0:23:38| or others to say let's look and have an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1418)|
| 0:23:40| in the city core rather than forcing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1420)|
| 0:23:42| a lot of this multifamily construction out further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1422)|
| 0:23:45| So, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1425)|
| 0:23:49| So we have, why do we need redevelopment tools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1429)|
| 0:23:53| Why not just set taxes on selected property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1433)|
| 0:23:56| This TIF program and pilot program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1436)|
| 0:23:58| really use the two sets of tools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1438)|
| 0:24:00| the state general assembly has provided to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1440)|
| 0:24:02| The state constitution says either body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1442)|
| 0:24:05| the council or the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1445)|
| 0:24:06| cannot just decide to set a tax rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1446)|
| 0:24:09| That would be ripe with all sorts of difficulties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1449)|
| 0:24:11| We can't come in, difficulties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1451)|
| 0:24:13| we can't come in and have a developer say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1453)|
| 0:24:15| you know, I'd like my taxes to be lower| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1455)|
| 0:24:17| and I'll make this sort of deal with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1457)|
| 0:24:19| that if you lower it for a while,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1459)|
| 0:24:20| I'll develop this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1460)|
| 0:24:21| We can't do that and we shouldn't be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1461)|
| 0:24:24| We don't want that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1464)|
| 0:24:25| So we have these tools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1465)|
| 0:24:27| There are two of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1467)|
| 0:24:28| One involves transferring property to a government body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1468)|
| 0:24:31| and thus rendering it not taxable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1471)|
| 0:24:33| and that's the payment in lieu of taxes program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1473)|
| 0:24:35| The other is a little more complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1475)|
| 0:24:38| It involves collecting the taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1478)|
| 0:24:41| just as we'd always collect them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1481)|
| 0:24:43| but developing them toward paying off part of a loan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1483)|
| 0:24:46| and that's the tax increment finance program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1486)|
| 0:24:50| Now, and I'll get into each of those in some detail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1490)|
| 0:24:53| and again, I'm moving kind of quickly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1493)|
| 0:24:55| so we can have some Q&A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1495)|
| 0:24:57| We have a process that we handle at the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1497)|
| 0:24:59| We work closely with county finance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1499)|
| 0:25:01| to let them know when applications come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1501)|
| 0:25:03| and jointly look at these at the appropriate time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1503)|
| 0:25:06| but we are staffed to review them early| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1506)|
| 0:25:08| and to work with the potential developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1508)|
| 0:25:10| or property owners and to sometimes encourage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1510)|
| 0:25:13| or discourage them as the case may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1513)|
| 0:25:15| So we have all, and we always want to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1515)|
| 0:25:19| that this is obviously transparent and open to everybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1519)|
| 0:25:23| and a goodly number of the developers we dealt with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1523)|
| 0:25:25| I'd never met before in my life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1525)|
| 0:25:27| and some I haven't seen since.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1527)|
| 0:25:29| That's okay as long as they pass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1529)|
| 0:25:30| through all the general considerations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1530)|
| 0:25:32| We don't want this to be something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1532)|
| 0:25:34| that some have an opportunity or access to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1534)|
| 0:25:36| and others don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1536)|
| 0:25:37| We have the applications online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1537)|
| 0:25:41| Once they come in, we review them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1541)|
| 0:25:42| We discourage or subsequently review further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1542)|
| 0:25:45| I'll stop with the third-party review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1545)|
| 0:25:47| because that's what Commissioner Smith asked me about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1547)|
| 0:25:49| We had engaged other people to help us consider those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1549)|
| 0:25:54| after a while, given all of our backgrounds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1554)|
| 0:25:56| and especially since, and I failed to mention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1556)|
| 0:25:58| my fellow deputy, Christy Branscombe here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1558)|
| 0:26:00| comes with a wealth of experience from the development world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1560)|
| 0:26:03| Upon her coming and our being staffed with our experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1563)|
| 0:26:07| we got used to what the review was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1567)|
| 0:26:08| and we were pretty able to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1568)|
| 0:26:10| many of those decisions ourselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1570)|
| 0:26:11| on what the cost would be for the project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1571)|
| 0:26:14| what the revenue might be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1574)|
| 0:26:16| whether we thought this project needed the gap filling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1576)|
| 0:26:20| that our tools give us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1580)|
| 0:26:22| But we, and by discourage or subsequently review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1582)|
| 0:26:26| I mean some projects come in and we have a dual test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1586)|
| 0:26:31| First is, is this project such that we really much care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1591)|
| 0:26:37| that it meets the public interest in any kind of way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1597)|
| 0:26:40| broadly, not public interest nearly defined,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1600)|
| 0:26:42| but broadly defined, like is this an historic building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1602)|
| 0:26:45| that we want to keep, or is this a brownfield| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1605)|
| 0:26:48| that we want developed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1608)|
| 0:26:50| Those sorts of questions that we want to then say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1610)|
| 0:26:52| well, let's go to step two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1612)|
| 0:26:54| And step two is what we call the but-for test,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1614)|
| 0:26:57| which I know is most critical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1617)|
| 0:26:59| Would this project happen without the TIF or pilot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1619)|
| 0:27:03| And we have to make sure that we're convinced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1623)|
| 0:27:06| that it would not happen but for the TIF and pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1626)|
| 0:27:10| And that I think is the key to very much concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1630)|
| 0:27:12| And we've heard from you folks, especially on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1632)|
| 0:27:14| and I think it was Commissioner Brantley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1634)|
| 0:27:16| at one of the meetings said, well, there's not only it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1636)|
| 0:27:18| but how do we know about the time involved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1638)|
| 0:27:20| I mean, why this many years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1640)|
| 0:27:22| So there's the, is it upside down at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1642)|
| 0:27:24| from a development perspective?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1644)|
| 0:27:25| And B, do we have a comfort level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1645)|
| 0:27:27| with providing no more assistance than is needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1647)|
| 0:27:31| because like everybody else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1651)|
| 0:27:33| we would rather have these tax dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1653)|
| 0:27:34| go to playing police and fire and all the other services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1654)|
| 0:27:38| going to schools and all the other things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1658)|
| 0:27:40| that we would like them to go for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1660)|
| 0:27:41| So we recently, as you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1661)|
| 0:27:44| when we came with another project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1664)|
| 0:27:46| decided along with KCDC and working with Mark Mametoff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1666)|
| 0:27:49| to bring in a third party review partner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1669)|
| 0:27:52| And that's a group that's done a lot of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1672)|
| 0:27:54| very credible, don't know anybody here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1674)|
| 0:27:56| so they have no relations with anybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1676)|
| 0:27:58| Municap out of Baltimore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1678)|
| 0:28:00| And we have a project now, which we're working that on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1680)|
| 0:28:04| and that's the Prior Brown Garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1684)|
| 0:28:07| And that's not done yet, that's in process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1687)|
| 0:28:10| but it's working well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1690)|
| 0:28:12| They are reviewing very much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1692)|
| 0:28:13| they're looking at cost figures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1693)|
| 0:28:15| they're looking at what the project should produce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1695)|
| 0:28:19| in terms of a condominium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1699)|
| 0:28:24| what it would sell for per square foot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1704)|
| 0:28:27| the risk involved in this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1707)|
| 0:28:29| And what we've asked them is taking national standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1709)|
| 0:28:31| of what's a reasonable return,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1711)|
| 0:28:33| given all of this risk, given the costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1713)|
| 0:28:35| given what he could expect in this case to sell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1715)|
| 0:28:39| or in some cases it might be leased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1719)|
| 0:28:40| some of the square footage for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1720)|
| 0:28:45| what kind of development gap do we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1725)|
| 0:28:47| that we would like to utilize the tool,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1727)|
| 0:28:49| in this case tax increment financing to fill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1729)|
| 0:28:52| That, like I said, that review is going forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1732)|
| 0:28:54| and the next one, assuming that one does come forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1734)|
| 0:28:56| we are optimistic that it will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1736)|
| 0:28:58| but we don't have the final results in yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1738)|
| 0:29:00| When we present that to all the bodies that will review it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1740)|
| 0:29:03| we will let you, obviously give you the benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1743)|
| 0:29:06| of that third-party review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1746)|
| 0:29:08| I might add that based on, we'll continue this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1748)|
| 0:29:13| and we've done it up to this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1753)|
| 0:29:14| we oftentimes push back on the amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1754)|
| 0:29:17| People have come in and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1757)|
| 0:29:18| we think we want a X-year pilot, or TIF,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1758)|
| 0:29:23| and many times upon looking at it, we'll go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1763)|
| 0:29:25| you know, we just can't justify that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1765)|
| 0:29:27| based on our own review, and we'll continue that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1767)|
| 0:29:29| so we will push back and have it be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1769)|
| 0:29:31| for a smaller amount of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1771)|
| 0:29:33| and sometimes nothing happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1773)|
| 0:29:34| It sits there for a year or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1774)|
| 0:29:36| They say, we can't make it work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1776)|
| 0:29:37| We say, well, that's, we can't comfortably recommend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1777)|
| 0:29:40| any more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1780)|
| 0:29:41| It is a judgment call, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1781)|
| 0:29:43| but that's the process that we go through on the front end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1783)|
| 0:29:45| All that sausage-making takes place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1785)|
| 0:29:47| prior to presenting it to the legislative bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1787)|
| 0:29:52| Anyway, finally, with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1792)|
| 0:29:53| we discuss with the Knox County Finance staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1793)|
| 0:29:56| inform them, let the mayor, Knox County mayor know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1796)|
| 0:29:58| let Mayor Burchard's staff know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1798)|
| 0:30:00| We have public hearings and vote by the public bodies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1800)|
| 0:30:03| including, obviously, County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1803)|
| 0:30:05| on Tax Increment Financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1805)|
| 0:30:08| I will go, I'm gonna speed through these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1808)|
| 0:30:10| again, given the time that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1810)|
| 0:30:12| and we have two different processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1812)|
| 0:30:14| Both start with a developer approaching the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1814)|
| 0:30:16| with a proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1816)|
| 0:30:17| I'm gonna talk about payment in lieu of taxes first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1817)|
| 0:30:20| We evaluate the gap in both cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1820)|
| 0:30:22| We inform the county administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1822)|
| 0:30:25| Payment of lieu in taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1825)|
| 0:30:26| go to the Industrial Development Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1826)|
| 0:30:30| And if initiated by the county, it goes to the county IDB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1830)|
| 0:30:33| Say the only pilot, y'all considered Marble Alley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1833)|
| 0:30:35| We didn't actually initiate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1835)|
| 0:30:37| That was initiated by Mayor Burchard's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1837)|
| 0:30:39| because it had been county land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1839)|
| 0:30:41| had been county property, that made sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1841)|
| 0:30:45| And what a pilot does is it freezes the taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1845)|
| 0:30:48| where they are for a number of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1848)|
| 0:30:50| just leaves them frozen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1850)|
| 0:30:51| The way it happens is the developer takes that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1851)|
| 0:30:55| and literally transfers the title| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1855)|
| 0:30:57| to the Industrial Development Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1857)|
| 0:30:59| gives them the title, and then it's off the tax rolls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1859)|
| 0:31:02| once they transfer it to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1862)|
| 0:31:04| And that stays off the tax rolls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1864)|
| 0:31:06| for a certain number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1866)|
| 0:31:09| And during that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1869)|
| 0:31:10| why it's called payment in lieu of taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1870)|
| 0:31:12| they agree to pay what the taxes were prior to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1872)|
| 0:31:17| to the county, and the city in this case, to both bodies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1877)|
| 0:31:20| to continue paying that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1880)|
| 0:31:21| but it's a payment instead of taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1881)|
| 0:31:23| because the property has become non-taxable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1883)|
| 0:31:26| Why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1886)|
| 0:31:27| Because the IDB owns it, and it's a public body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1887)|
| 0:31:29| The IDB and KCDC actually, as public bodies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1889)|
| 0:31:33| serve a valuable purpose to help us do those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1893)|
| 0:31:36| And so it's quite simple in a way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1896)|
| 0:31:38| and many people say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1898)|
| 0:31:39| I don't wanna give over title of that to the IDB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1899)|
| 0:31:42| but in fact, that's what works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1902)|
| 0:31:44| Their business runs as usual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1904)|
| 0:31:45| It only affects their tax burden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1905)|
| 0:31:49| Now, that gives us a nice ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1909)|
| 0:31:52| to write in a development agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1912)|
| 0:31:54| that if the developer falls short on something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1914)|
| 0:31:56| that he or she agreed to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1916)|
| 0:31:58| we can say, well, that payment in lieu of taxes ends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1918)|
| 0:32:01| We'll give you back the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1921)|
| 0:32:03| We don't want it anymore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1923)|
| 0:32:04| or IDB will give it back to you, and then it's fully taxed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1924)|
| 0:32:07| So that really is an easy way, one, to take care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1927)|
| 0:32:10| This generally works for something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1930)|
| 0:32:12| that's going to be a lease rather than owned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1932)|
| 0:32:14| And we could go, it's not totally that way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1934)|
| 0:32:16| for all properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1936)|
| 0:32:17| but it generally works better for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1937)|
| 0:32:19| It also generally works for not quite as large of projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1939)|
| 0:32:23| but there are exceptions to that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1943)|
| 0:32:25| Tax increment financing is a little more complex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1945)|
| 0:32:28| a little different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1948)|
| 0:32:29| It starts in the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1949)|
| 0:32:30| They approach us, we do the staff work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1950)|
| 0:32:32| we discuss this with the county administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1952)|
| 0:32:35| at a certain, when at the appropriate point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1955)|
| 0:32:37| And if it's approved, the way a TIF works is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1957)|
| 0:32:41| the developer says, my project with a bank loan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1961)|
| 0:32:44| the bank is only gonna lose so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1964)|
| 0:32:46| This project won't work because there's a gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1966)|
| 0:32:48| We need to fill that gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1968)|
| 0:32:50| And there's another loan set up to help fill that gap,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1970)|
| 0:32:53| and some of the tax dollars that are collected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1973)|
| 0:32:57| will pay off that loan until it's paid off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1977)|
| 0:33:00| and that will go up to a certain amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1980)|
| 0:33:03| I'm gonna get into that more in an example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1983)|
| 0:33:04| so I think it would be easier than being abstract about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1984)|
| 0:33:07| But the tax increment financing process provides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1987)|
| 0:33:10| for a loan to be paid off by about 2 3rds or 3 4ths| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1990)|
| 0:33:14| of the new taxes for a number of years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1994)|
| 0:33:16| to close that gap and make the project work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1996)|
| 0:33:19| Everybody in the project, like let's say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=1999)|
| 0:33:22| I'm gonna use the Holston,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2002)|
| 0:33:23| everybody who lives in the Holston building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2003)|
| 0:33:25| pays their taxes, they have no idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2005)|
| 0:33:27| they're in a tax increment financing project or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2007)|
| 0:33:29| They pay their taxes, they get their bill in the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2009)|
| 0:33:31| It's just when it goes to the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2011)|
| 0:33:33| and it goes to the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2013)|
| 0:33:34| those taxes are then forwarded to KCDC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2014)|
| 0:33:37| to help pay off the loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2017)|
| 0:33:39| So full taxes are paid there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2019)|
| 0:33:40| it's just that the taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2020)|
| 0:33:42| some of them are directed toward a loan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2022)|
| 0:33:44| to make this project happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2024)|
| 0:33:47| Now let me use an example that's a little clearer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2027)|
| 0:33:49| Use the Holston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2029)|
| 0:33:51| Back in the early 2000s, largely vacant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2031)|
| 0:33:55| Class C office building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2035)|
| 0:33:56| many of you from Knoxville are familiar with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2036)|
| 0:33:59| Fairly languishing, starting to deteriorate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2039)|
| 0:34:02| It was appraised at $911,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2042)|
| 0:34:07| And we were, and the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2047)|
| 0:34:08| just the county was getting $8,400 a year in taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2048)|
| 0:34:12| We had every reason to believe from looking at that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2052)|
| 0:34:15| for all the difficulty in developing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2055)|
| 0:34:17| putting it in all the conditions of the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2057)|
| 0:34:21| and the bank loan and risk situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2061)|
| 0:34:23| that that building was gonna sit that way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2063)|
| 0:34:25| as far as the eye could see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2065)|
| 0:34:27| generating $8,454 in county taxes a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2067)|
| 0:34:31| Now what we did through the TIF program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2071)|
| 0:34:33| and we'll follow this diagram through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2073)|
| 0:34:34| I think will make sense of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2074)|
| 0:34:37| There was an approval, that's in reddish orange up there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2077)|
| 0:34:41| and the owner put a lot of equity in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2081)|
| 0:34:43| The owner got his construction loan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2083)|
| 0:34:46| but also there is this up to 15 years of a TIF loan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2086)|
| 0:34:51| for the new taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2091)|
| 0:34:52| So basically, once the owner improved the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2092)|
| 0:34:56| it went from 911 appraised value to 18 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2096)|
| 0:35:01| And I'll say in this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2101)|
| 0:35:02| neither the city of Knoxville or Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2102)|
| 0:35:05| put a dollar into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2105)|
| 0:35:06| No check was written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2106)|
| 0:35:08| That's all investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2108)|
| 0:35:09| Now obviously indirectly, those tax dollars went into it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2109)|
| 0:35:12| but our position is they weren't gonna,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2112)|
| 0:35:14| those are new tax dollars, not old tax dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2114)|
| 0:35:16| So what ended up happening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2116)|
| 0:35:18| if you follow over to the right side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2118)|
| 0:35:19| with the green figures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2119)|
| 0:35:23| is we kept getting the original taxes of 8,400 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2123)|
| 0:35:27| The way the TIF works, you get new taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2127)|
| 0:35:30| equal in proportion to what proportion your debt is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2130)|
| 0:35:34| of your overall budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2134)|
| 0:35:36| So right away, Knox County started getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2136)|
| 0:35:40| almost $20,000 in new taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2140)|
| 0:35:42| along with the 8,000 who were receiving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2142)|
| 0:35:44| The city got approximately the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2144)|
| 0:35:47| After 15 years, and that's about to happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2147)|
| 0:35:50| this is only, we're at about year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2150)|
| 0:35:52| we're in the next year or two, that will happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2152)|
| 0:35:55| Then those properties will be producing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2155)|
| 0:35:58| an additional $76,000 on top of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2158)|
| 0:36:02| And overall, the county and the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2162)|
| 0:36:05| will actually get even slightly more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2165)|
| 0:36:06| Knox County will be getting $96,000 long-term benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2166)|
| 0:36:10| That's in the, what you're getting already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2170)|
| 0:36:12| and what we're getting from the new taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2172)|
| 0:36:14| that'll come in, going to the county general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2174)|
| 0:36:17| No expenditure of county funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2177)|
| 0:36:19| no increased demands on county services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2179)|
| 0:36:21| and frankly, minimal demands on city services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2181)|
| 0:36:23| We pick up a little more trash,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2183)|
| 0:36:25| we do some other things there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2185)|
| 0:36:26| some other projects the city puts in the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2186)|
| 0:36:29| And I might say, on all these projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2189)|
| 0:36:30| it's the city's obligation to fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2190)|
| 0:36:32| whatever infrastructure is necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2192)|
| 0:36:34| For instance, Marble Alley, we put in a million dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2194)|
| 0:36:37| in sidewalks around Marble Alley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2197)|
| 0:36:38| to make that happen to the city government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2198)|
| 0:36:41| which is appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2201)|
| 0:36:44| Okay, so basically, to aggregate this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2204)|
| 0:36:47| what we have in the TIF projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2207)|
| 0:36:49| right now, Knox County, as soon as they're underway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2209)|
| 0:36:53| and most of these are, is getting $350,000 now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2213)|
| 0:36:57| in new dollars out of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2217)|
| 0:37:00| The long-term would be $1,687,000 a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2220)|
| 0:37:04| these are yearly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2224)|
| 0:37:05| And the pilot projects, because they're frozen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2225)|
| 0:37:09| Knox County is not in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2229)|
| 0:37:10| are getting no short-term, but long-term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2230)|
| 0:37:13| they'll be a little over $1,000,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2233)|
| 0:37:15| So all together, we're getting $350,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2235)|
| 0:37:18| approximately short-term while the projects are underway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2238)|
| 0:37:22| and then $2.8 million a year when they're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2242)|
| 0:37:26| Now, you can go ahead to the next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2246)|
| 0:37:30| We've got, each project is visible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2250)|
| 0:37:32| if you would like to click on there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2252)|
| 0:37:33| and run through a little, we're going online now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2253)|
| 0:37:36| to what we call the storyboard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2256)|
| 0:37:41| It makes this, okay, and every one of the projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2261)|
| 0:37:45| is on the map right there, and right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2265)|
| 0:37:48| if you'll go down, you can click through each one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2268)|
| 0:37:50| and you can see everything I've talked about on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2270)|
| 0:37:53| 15 years, when it ends, when it began,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2273)|
| 0:37:57| what the original appraisal was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2277)|
| 0:37:59| what the post-project appraisal was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2279)|
| 0:38:01| and so anybody who's interested in these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2281)|
| 0:38:03| and we hope people tend to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2283)|
| 0:38:04| we want to make it very easy to people to know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2284)|
| 0:38:06| well, what are we talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2286)|
| 0:38:08| Let's see some examples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2288)|
| 0:38:09| Brownville School was a great example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2289)|
| 0:38:11| That was a languishing school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2291)|
| 0:38:12| that we set up a one-parcel redevelopment area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2292)|
| 0:38:14| to allow a tax increment financing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2294)|
| 0:38:16| to have that project work and solve a lot of problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2296)|
| 0:38:19| for, in that case, county government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2299)|
| 0:38:20| and the Knox County schools, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2300)|
| 0:38:22| to have their projects stay on the tax rolls, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2302)|
| 0:38:28| There are some more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2308)|
| 0:38:29| We don't have to run through them all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2309)|
| 0:38:30| but I wanted y'all to see that all of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2310)|
| 0:38:32| were available for public view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2312)|
| 0:38:37| Now, if you want to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2317)|
| 0:38:38| we have the same thing for the pilot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2318)|
| 0:38:40| and why don't you go to the last page| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2320)|
| 0:38:41| where we talk about sort of the summary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2321)|
| 0:38:43| to Knox County taxpayers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2323)|
| 0:38:46| and I'll talk about the advantages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2326)|
| 0:38:48| and then I'll talk about the one risk to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2328)|
| 0:38:49| as decision-makers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2329)|
| 0:38:51| This isn't, you know, I'll treat this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2331)|
| 0:38:53| more like an academic presentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2333)|
| 0:38:54| of my past life rather than a sales job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2334)|
| 0:38:56| though there are elements that overlap between the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2336)|
| 0:39:00| Advantages to Knox County taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2340)|
| 0:39:02| Knox County's gonna grow a lot in the next 50 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2342)|
| 0:39:05| Would this project encourage growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2345)|
| 0:39:07| and density in the city core?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2347)|
| 0:39:09| Lessens pressure for greater density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2349)|
| 0:39:11| more suburban and rural areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2351)|
| 0:39:13| I read with interest in the Sentinel this morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2353)|
| 0:39:15| the discussion in East Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2355)|
| 0:39:17| where many people say, we don't want any growth out here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2357)|
| 0:39:21| and I understand that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2361)|
| 0:39:22| and others said, we want minimal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2362)|
| 0:39:24| especially, and as you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2364)|
| 0:39:25| especially when it comes to multifamily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2365)|
| 0:39:27| which most of these projects are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2367)|
| 0:39:28| virtually all of these projects are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2368)|
| 0:39:30| that we want to say, for that kind of growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2370)|
| 0:39:32| we have opportunity for it to be in the core.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2372)|
| 0:39:34| We got the services there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2374)|
| 0:39:36| We got the schools there that have capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2376)|
| 0:39:39| The neighbors want it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2379)|
| 0:39:40| We have plenty of traffic capacity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2380)|
| 0:39:43| so rather than trying to go into areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2383)|
| 0:39:46| where there are lots of very good reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2386)|
| 0:39:48| that people might object to density at whatever level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2388)|
| 0:39:52| let's have that go here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2392)|
| 0:39:54| Again, I'm not trying to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2394)|
| 0:39:56| that everybody who comes to Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2396)|
| 0:39:58| is gonna want to move in the city core.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2398)|
| 0:39:59| Most are not, but we want to give plenty of opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2399)|
| 0:40:02| for those who do, and I think it's a good statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2402)|
| 0:40:05| The city of Knoxville wants to be about growth inside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2405)|
| 0:40:08| We're not looking at growth by expansion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2408)|
| 0:40:12| in terms of geography.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2412)|
| 0:40:14| We have substantial short increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2414)|
| 0:40:16| and larger long-term increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2416)|
| 0:40:18| in the tax base to support development all over the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2418)|
| 0:40:21| No opposition, we have not ever gotten any opposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2421)|
| 0:40:24| from any neighbors for massive numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2424)|
| 0:40:26| of new people coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2426)|
| 0:40:27| No expenditure of county funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2427)|
| 0:40:29| minimal expenditure of city funds, some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2429)|
| 0:40:31| City of Knoxville pays for any infrastructure improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2431)|
| 0:40:35| Now, what is the potential downside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2435)|
| 0:40:37| is captured back by this third-party review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2437)|
| 0:40:40| and that is we don't want to do this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2440)|
| 0:40:42| unless we know that project is not going to happen otherwise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2442)|
| 0:40:47| but for a test, and that's a point of real,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2447)|
| 0:40:51| I mean, that's where reasonable people might jump and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2451)|
| 0:40:53| and in your shoes, say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2453)|
| 0:40:55| that's, mate, we've got to know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2455)|
| 0:40:57| to do our due diligence as a legislative body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2457)|
| 0:40:59| and we're convinced this is true,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2459)|
| 0:41:01| and there are a number of indicators why we feel this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2461)|
| 0:41:04| Now, in all the projects we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2464)|
| 0:41:06| might one of them have come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2466)|
| 0:41:07| a number of years later, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2467)|
| 0:41:09| but our experience tells us that's minimal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2469)|
| 0:41:13| because even in projects that we've granted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2473)|
| 0:41:15| tax increment financing, in some cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2475)|
| 0:41:18| payment in lieu of taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2478)|
| 0:41:19| it still didn't work, even with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2479)|
| 0:41:21| let alone without it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2481)|
| 0:41:22| We had this commission, it was a major county initiative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2482)|
| 0:41:27| the old Sentinel Towers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2487)|
| 0:41:28| they were granted a large tax increment financing package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2488)|
| 0:41:31| They could never make it work with the TIF,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2491)|
| 0:41:33| let alone without the TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2493)|
| 0:41:35| Same thing we went through on the KUB building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2495)|
| 0:41:38| a number of trials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2498)|
| 0:41:40| We went through a number over there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2500)|
| 0:41:42| where the Tennessean is going to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2502)|
| 0:41:45| and State Supreme Court site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2505)|
| 0:41:47| we offered a payment in lieu of taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2507)|
| 0:41:49| for development there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2509)|
| 0:41:50| The developer never could make it work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2510)|
| 0:41:51| So we have lots of experience that even with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2511)|
| 0:41:54| these are very difficult projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2514)|
| 0:41:55| because they're brownfield elements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2515)|
| 0:41:57| We demand a structured parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2517)|
| 0:41:59| and other difficult infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2519)|
| 0:42:00| and it's a real challenge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2520)|
| 0:42:02| and there's substantially more indifferent risk there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2522)|
| 0:42:08| than there has been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2528)|
| 0:42:10| That leaves, I know we're supposed to be out here by five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2530)|
| 0:42:12| and I hate to just go through it like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2532)|
| 0:42:14| but I wanted to make sure it was all out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2534)|
| 0:42:17| and I'm more than willing, either right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2537)|
| 0:42:19| or, and we can hand out this presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2539)|
| 0:42:21| we have hard copies, along with anything else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2541)|
| 0:42:23| or any time, any of y'all call me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2543)|
| 0:42:25| and many of you have on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2545)|
| 0:42:26| So I'm open for Q&A right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2546)|
| 0:42:34| That was great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2554)|
| 0:42:35| That was outstanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2555)|
| 0:42:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2556)|
| 0:42:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2557)|
| 0:42:40| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2560)|
| 0:42:41| Nobody else is gonna talk, you know me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2561)|
| 0:42:43| I always gotta talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2563)|
| 0:42:44| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2564)|
| 0:42:45| Bill, I would just like to say that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2565)|
| 0:42:48| when this program started a few years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2568)|
| 0:42:52| a lot of people were apprehensive about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2572)|
| 0:42:55| Oh, you know, we're losing money, we're losing money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2575)|
| 0:42:58| You can't lose something you don't have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2578)|
| 0:43:01| And I think this has proven to be a fantastic program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2581)|
| 0:43:06| for not only the city, but also for Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2586)|
| 0:43:08| and I appreciate your department and your folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2588)|
| 0:43:12| for getting this act together and working with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2592)|
| 0:43:16| you know, the city and the county together on these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2596)|
| 0:43:19| And, you know, that's the only way we can grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2599)|
| 0:43:21| So I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2601)|
| 0:43:23| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2603)|
| 0:43:23| And we understand these things, A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2603)|
| 0:43:26| have been not done well in other places often,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2606)|
| 0:43:29| for a variety of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2609)|
| 0:43:30| In any of them, I will say, and I grew up in Memphis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2610)|
| 0:43:33| I can say that, not everything is necessarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2613)|
| 0:43:35| the way you'd want to model it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2615)|
| 0:43:37| By the way, things get done there, some would say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2617)|
| 0:43:39| But they have turned over a lot of the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2619)|
| 0:43:41| their pilots are done independently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2621)|
| 0:43:43| without review of legislative bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2623)|
| 0:43:44| They've given the authority away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2624)|
| 0:43:46| which you have the authority to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2626)|
| 0:43:48| you know, to do that if you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2628)|
| 0:43:50| And we've said from the beginning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2630)|
| 0:43:52| we want maximum everybody to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2632)|
| 0:43:55| You know, we want to take these, we want to be public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2635)|
| 0:43:57| we want to have all of this available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2637)|
| 0:43:59| because as I tell my staff regularly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2639)|
| 0:44:01| and we have these, we're only as good as the last,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2641)|
| 0:44:06| as the last one of these we did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2646)|
| 0:44:08| and we have to be vigilant that we don't use this tool| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2648)|
| 0:44:12| any more than we have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2652)|
| 0:44:13| I will say this, we've turned a number of them down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2653)|
| 0:44:16| viewed at the staff level, saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2656)|
| 0:44:17| we just can't recommend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2657)|
| 0:44:19| And, you know, that's, the ones we've turned down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2659)|
| 0:44:21| nothing has happened, so we figure that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2661)|
| 0:44:25| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2665)|
| 0:44:29| One more thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2669)|
| 0:44:31| It's not just the added income we get off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2671)|
| 0:44:36| of the property taxes on these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2676)|
| 0:44:39| but when you're talking about residential buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2679)|
| 0:44:40| you're talking about people in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2680)|
| 0:44:42| who are gonna spend money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2682)|
| 0:44:43| Oh, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2683)|
| 0:44:44| You're talking about sales tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2684)|
| 0:44:46| you're talking about all these other things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2686)|
| 0:44:47| that go into it, so it's not just the property tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2687)|
| 0:44:52| you know, that you gotta look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2692)|
| 0:44:54| And one last thing, and now then sales mode a little more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2694)|
| 0:44:57| sorry, take the Holston, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2697)|
| 0:44:59| but not just the Holston, there are a number of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2699)|
| 0:45:02| in those properties from other places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2702)|
| 0:45:04| that have come because of downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2704)|
| 0:45:05| and decided they want to retire here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2705)|
| 0:45:07| And they come in and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2707)|
| 0:45:08| they don't have any kids in school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2708)|
| 0:45:10| and they bring, they eat out almost every night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2710)|
| 0:45:12| and all that money is going to other things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2712)|
| 0:45:15| paying off debt for a convention center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2715)|
| 0:45:17| Sales tax from the city, 72 cents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2717)|
| 0:45:20| goes to schools, as you know, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2720)|
| 0:45:21| so it's a, when it comes from somewhere else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2721)|
| 0:45:24| we know we're just not moving money around Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2724)|
| 0:45:26| but we're bringing new dollars in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2726)|
| 0:45:29| Mr. Brantley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2729)|
| 0:45:30| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2730)|
| 0:45:31| Mr. Lyons, the state offers tax incentives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2731)|
| 0:45:34| for industry and companies to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2734)|
| 0:45:36| to the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2736)|
| 0:45:38| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2738)|
| 0:45:39| Does this work in conjunction with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2739)|
| 0:45:41| to get these businesses and industries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2741)|
| 0:45:43| into Knoxville and Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2743)|
| 0:45:45| Yeah, it's very, I'm glad you mentioned that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2745)|
| 0:45:46| because we, I haven't even really decided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2746)|
| 0:45:49| to include in this presentation a number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2749)|
| 0:45:51| of other times we've come, used these tools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2751)|
| 0:45:55| specifically with the state when, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2755)|
| 0:45:57| we did it for, let's, to keep Kimberly Clark,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2757)|
| 0:46:02| they moved out west, it was barely in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2762)|
| 0:46:04| but they said to stay, along with some state incentives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2764)|
| 0:46:06| we provided a pilot to them for a number of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2766)|
| 0:46:10| and I know Knox County does that, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2770)|
| 0:46:11| with their own matrix through their IDB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2771)|
| 0:46:14| We would love, and we've had, we've used some of these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2774)|
| 0:46:17| and really, primarily, we'd love to use more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2777)|
| 0:46:20| for job retention, not, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2780)|
| 0:46:23| these jobs associated with the construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2783)|
| 0:46:24| and with the operating of the businesses here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2784)|
| 0:46:26| but for actual industry that are bringing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2786)|
| 0:46:29| and hiring people, so that's, we do work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2789)|
| 0:46:32| with the state when they, whenever they ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2792)|
| 0:46:34| for us to take a pilot, usually a pilot, forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2794)|
| 0:46:38| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2798)|
| 0:46:41| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2801)|
| 0:46:42| Hey, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2802)|
| 0:46:43| Bill, I just wanna tell you, I appreciate your willingness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2803)|
| 0:46:47| I mean, it seems like every time I run into you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2807)|
| 0:46:49| we'll be downtown having dinner or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2809)|
| 0:46:51| I end up bending your ear for an hour about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2811)|
| 0:46:54| so your willingness to always talk about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2814)|
| 0:46:57| and explain it, and I appreciate it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2817)|
| 0:46:58| and obviously, your wealth of knowledge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2818)|
| 0:47:01| to help us go through this, and I'm encouraged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2821)|
| 0:47:03| about this third party, because I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2823)|
| 0:47:06| that was sorely needed to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2826)|
| 0:47:10| that everybody feels comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2830)|
| 0:47:11| with what we're trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2831)|
| 0:47:12| Well, we heard you on that, and I'd say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2832)|
| 0:47:14| that's, totally agree with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2834)|
| 0:47:16| and I appreciate the members of the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2836)|
| 0:47:19| who said we really need to see this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2839)|
| 0:47:21| for making sure that came to a head, so thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2841)|
| 0:47:24| Couldn't agree more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2844)|
| 0:47:26| And I wanna thank you, too, sir, for taking the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2846)|
| 0:47:28| to sit down with me on several occasions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2848)|
| 0:47:30| and dig into pretty deep detail on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2850)|
| 0:47:33| to help me get a much better understanding of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2853)|
| 0:47:36| and I just wanted you to come here today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2856)|
| 0:47:38| to allow us to ask any questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2858)|
| 0:47:40| and to present this once again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2860)|
| 0:47:42| when it was not on a specific project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2862)|
| 0:47:45| Well, I appreciate your thinking of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2865)|
| 0:47:47| because this is a better way to get,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2867)|
| 0:47:48| without trying to shoehorn it in us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2868)|
| 0:47:50| and then it gets caught up, the policy gets caught up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2870)|
| 0:47:53| in the project and its pluses and minuses that people have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2873)|
| 0:47:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2878)|
| 0:47:59| Thank you very much, appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2879)|
| 0:48:01| Anybody have anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2881)|
| 0:48:03| Anybody have anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2883)|
| 0:48:05| Or a chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2885)|
| 0:48:06| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS160718Finance?start=2886)|
