| 0:06:35| but that wouldn't happen until the board was sort of constituted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-2?start=395)|
| 0:06:41| they picked a new chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-2?start=401)|

| 0:07:02| is it would actually come to us for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-2?start=422)|
| 0:07:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-2?start=424)|
| 0:07:05| They would adopt it within their own board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-2?start=425)|
| 0:07:09| and then they would send it to us to codify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-2?start=429)|
| 0:07:12| The only question I still have outstanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-2?start=432)|
| 0:07:16| which I haven't asked the law department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-2?start=436)|
| 0:07:18| so it's not fair to put them on the spot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-2?start=438)|
| 0:07:20| but with ordinances I believe it's 30 days after,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-2?start=440)|
| 0:07:24| if it were to pass, it takes effect 30 days after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-2?start=444)|
| 0:07:27| I believe that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-2?start=447)|
| 0:07:28| So any new appointments to the board wouldn't happen in the August meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-2?start=448)|
| 0:07:34| it would happen in the September meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-2?start=454)|
| 0:07:36| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-2?start=456)|
