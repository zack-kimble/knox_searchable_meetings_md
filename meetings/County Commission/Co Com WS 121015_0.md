| 0:00:00| regarding historical overlay and related issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=0)|
| 0:00:06| I'll read into the record our two items that are under consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6)|
| 0:00:13| First, discussion of Ordinance Number O-12-9-103,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=13)|
| 0:00:20| proposing amendments to the Knox County Zoning Ordinance Article 5, Section 5.80,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=20)|
| 0:00:27| historic overlay zone to conform to state law and composition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=27)|
| 0:00:32| and appointment of members to the Knox County Historic Zoning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=32)|
| 0:00:38| The other item is discussion of Ordinance Number O-12-9-102,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=38)|
| 0:00:45| proposing amendments to the Knox County Zoning Ordinance to edit, clarify, correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=45)|
| 0:00:50| and make other minor changes to the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=50)|
| 0:00:55| Do we have anyone here to speak to either one of these issues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=55)|
| 0:01:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=63)|
| 0:01:06| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=66)|
| 0:01:07| Would you like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=67)|
| 0:01:08| Come to the microphone and give your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=68)|
| 0:01:12| Bill Pierce with the Codes Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=72)|
| 0:01:14| I'm just here to answer questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=74)|
| 0:01:15| Okay, Bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=75)|
| 0:01:16| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=76)|
| 0:01:17| I didn't recognize you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=77)|
| 0:01:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=80)|
| 0:01:22| Anybody else like to speak to either?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=82)|
| 0:01:25| Mr. Donaldson, would you just go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=85)|
| 0:01:27| and give us a summary since we don't have anybody to object?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=87)|
| 0:01:32| As briefly as I can, the ordinance amendment to the historic overlay zone is to bring the Knox County zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=92)|
| 0:01:46| ordinance into compliance with state law with regard to providing the authority to the county mayor to appoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=106)|
| 0:01:54| members that will then be ratified by the county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=114)|
| 0:01:59| and then to also make sure that there is a member of the planning commission that sits on the historic zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=119)|
| 0:02:08| commission as well to create a linkage between those two bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=128)|
| 0:02:12| And this is going parallel with a similar amendment in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=132)|
| 0:02:18| and as openings become available on the historic zoning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=138)|
| 0:02:24| we will work to get a planning commission member to volunteer to be that link.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=144)|
| 0:02:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=151)|
| 0:02:32| Thank you, Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=152)|
| 0:02:33| Do any of the members of the commission have any comments or questions regarding that item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=153)|
| 0:02:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=160)|
| 0:02:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=161)|
| 0:02:42| So that means that the mayor appoints all members of the historic zoning commission now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=162)|
| 0:02:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=168)|
| 0:02:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=173)|
| 0:02:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=175)|
| 0:02:56| What about the second item then, Mr. Donaldson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=176)|
| 0:03:00| The second item is an amendment to edit the entire zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=180)|
| 0:03:06| It was brought through us by Roy and Bill, who must have spent the long winter hours last winter calling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=186)|
| 0:03:15| through the entire code and literally doing edits and making sure the format was consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=195)|
| 0:03:25| and all of the language was consistent with commonly accepted capitalizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=205)|
| 0:03:31| and hyphenations and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=211)|
| 0:03:35| The big thing is that there are no changes to any policies or dimensional requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=215)|
| 0:03:40| or land uses or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=220)|
| 0:03:42| It is simply editing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=222)|
| 0:03:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=224)|
| 0:03:45| Any other questions regarding this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=225)|
| 0:03:47| Mr. Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=227)|
| 0:03:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=228)|
| 0:03:49| Roy, is this taking into account anything we talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=229)|
| 0:03:56| about the grading versus building permit issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=236)|
| 0:04:02| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=242)|
| 0:04:04| Like Mr. Donaldson said, this has no regulatory changes or anything whatsoever that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=244)|
| 0:04:12| should cause anyone any concern other than we're trying to get the zoning ordinance in a proper format that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=252)|
| 0:04:20| I think because it's been updated so many times over the years that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=260)|
| 0:04:26| format had been lost and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=266)|
| 0:04:29| And I think that it's a good basis for us to start amending in phase two and three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=269)|
| 0:04:37| So we still need to work on the other one then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=277)|
| 0:04:39| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=279)|
| 0:04:40| There's a lot of things I think that has come up over the last few years and months that we need to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=280)|
| 0:04:47| And we're going to be working with Mark and MPC on making some amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=287)|
| 0:04:53| Say a good example is definitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=293)|
| 0:04:57| We're going to be working with Mark and MPC about updating some definitions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=297)|
| 0:05:01| putting some new definitions in that will help with such as even grading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=301)|
| 0:05:07| That may be something that we can put in a definition that might clarify what needs to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=307)|
| 0:05:17| Do you have a timeline to bring these things to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=317)|
| 0:05:21| Or is it just you're going to wait until you get them all in a package| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=321)|
| 0:05:25| or are you going to bring them kind of as we go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=325)|
| 0:05:28| Well, we had talked about addressing definitions more quickly than other things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=328)|
| 0:05:34| getting a package of those together and brought to you fairly quickly, a couple of months or so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=334)|
| 0:05:41| and then move on to various policy changes, cleaning up land use, classifications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=341)|
| 0:05:51| and those sorts of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=351)|
| 0:05:54| Well, the one thing that I was referring to when I was talking to Roy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=354)|
| 0:06:00| was the fact that right now I can go out here and get a grading permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=360)|
| 0:06:07| that nobody knows anything about except the person that issued the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=367)|
| 0:06:11| But then you come along later and, okay, I'm going to do some building now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=371)|
| 0:06:16| and then I'm going to go to codes and get my permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=376)|
| 0:06:19| Well, maybe that doesn't jive what you're wanting to get the permit for for what you did the grading for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=379)|
| 0:06:28| And nobody, in other words, the right hand is not knowing what the left hand is doing right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=388)|
| 0:06:33| Some way we can correlate this were that there's information passed that these are correlated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=393)|
| 0:06:39| In other words, when I get a grading permit, what's going to be the end use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=399)|
| 0:06:45| That's what I'm talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=405)|
| 0:06:48| And that may be better addressed in the regular code of ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=408)|
| 0:06:54| rather than the zoning ordinance, but linked to it somehow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=414)|
| 0:07:03| Is that it, Mr. Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=423)|
| 0:07:04| You good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=424)|
| 0:07:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=425)|
| 0:07:06| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=426)|
| 0:07:07| Mr. Pierce, do you have anything that you'd like to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=427)|
| 0:07:10| You're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=430)|
| 0:07:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=431)|
| 0:07:12| Any other questions or comments regarding either one of these items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=432)|
| 0:07:18| Seeing none, we consider this public meeting adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=438)|
| 0:07:21| And then we'll reconvene at 1 for the hearing about ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=441)|
| 0:07:40| We are now in public hearing to consider candidates that are seeking an appointment to the ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=460)|
| 0:07:47| And we're here to interview those candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=467)|
| 0:07:50| It's been our custom in the past to allow a few minutes for each one of the candidates to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=470)|
| 0:07:57| And so we'll begin that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=477)|
| 0:08:00| And then after each candidate gives their description| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=480)|
| 0:08:07| and hopefully why they're wanting this position, some of the commissioners may want to ask questions then at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=487)|
| 0:08:14| So if there's any other questions, commissioners, we'll go ahead and start that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=494)|
| 0:08:21| And we'll begin and we'll go alphabetically by the list that I've got in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=501)|
| 0:08:27| So the first person is Robert Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=507)|
| 0:08:32| Is Mr. Bailey here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=512)|
| 0:08:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=514)|
| 0:08:35| And then we'll just proceed through the list and then if they need to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=515)|
| 0:08:39| if they come later and want to speak, that will be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=519)|
| 0:08:41| Carl Brewer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=521)|
| 0:08:45| Steve Cinnamon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=525)|
| 0:08:48| Herbert Cleveland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=528)|
| 0:08:52| Scott Daniel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=532)|
| 0:08:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=535)|
| 0:08:56| Thank you, Mr. Daniel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=536)|
| 0:08:57| If you come forward and just say your name and address and then go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=537)|
| 0:09:02| We appreciate you coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=542)|
| 0:09:04| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=544)|
| 0:09:05| I'm Scott Daniel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=545)|
| 0:09:06| I live at 1009 East Tacoma Circle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=546)|
| 0:09:09| I'm here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=549)|
| 0:09:12| Thanks for meeting with me today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=552)|
| 0:09:14| I'm applying for the Ethics Board for a couple of reasons, which I'll get to in a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=554)|
| 0:09:18| But I wanted to introduce you to me first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=558)|
| 0:09:20| I grew up in Knoxville, Tennessee, off Pleasant Ridge Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=560)|
| 0:09:24| Went and was a product of Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=564)|
| 0:09:26| Then went to UT, where I spent about eight years, I have to say, trying to leave Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=566)|
| 0:09:32| I was an undergraduate there in speech communication, then went on to law school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=572)|
| 0:09:37| and also got my MBA as part of the dual degree program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=577)|
| 0:09:40| And that's where the leaving started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=580)|
| 0:09:42| I joined Procter & Gamble and worked in northwest Arkansas, Toronto, and Cincinnati.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=582)|
| 0:09:48| I'm primarily working in the household cleaner brands, most notably on Tide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=588)|
| 0:09:53| In 2007, I was recruited by Bush Brothers & Company to come back to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=593)|
| 0:09:58| And that was the part where we were able to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=598)|
| 0:10:01| My wife and I now live here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=601)|
| 0:10:03| We've been here for about five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=603)|
| 0:10:05| We have two young little boys, Weston and Baker, that are both under the ages of four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=605)|
| 0:10:10| I'm interested in the Ethics Committee for a couple of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=610)|
| 0:10:13| I think it does start with our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=613)|
| 0:10:16| We owe it to everyone in this community, I believe, to have faith in an integrity-driven county government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=616)|
| 0:10:22| whether that be appointed, employed, or nominated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=622)|
| 0:10:27| And I believe this committee can help us ensure that we have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=627)|
| 0:10:31| I think we have a great integrity-driven government already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=631)|
| 0:10:33| It's not that we have problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=633)|
| 0:10:35| But I do believe citizen involvement by members of the community can help us hold everyone accountable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=635)|
| 0:10:41| whether it be branches of government or individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=641)|
| 0:10:44| And then, secondly, as you think about states| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=644)|
| 0:10:46| and counties rebounding and working their way through the economic recession,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=646)|
| 0:10:50| the counties that win are going to be those counties that have cohesive integrity-driven governments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=650)|
| 0:10:56| that are attractive to both small, mid-size, and large employers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=656)|
| 0:11:00| And that's where I really would like to see the Ethics Committee contribute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=660)|
| 0:11:03| is that helping us make sure that we have that trust in government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=663)|
| 0:11:07| that whether you're a small business owner thinking about starting a business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=667)|
| 0:11:10| or whether you be a mid-size or larger company that's thinking about moving to Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=670)|
| 0:11:14| when you look at Knox County, you'll see a county government that you can count on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=674)|
| 0:11:18| And those are really the two major reasons I'm interested in applying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=678)|
| 0:11:21| From a personal standpoint, I have to say I've never been involved in county government in any way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=681)|
| 0:11:26| So I do see this as a chance to get involved personally and give back to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=686)|
| 0:11:30| I think Knoxville is a great place to live, and I'd like to see us continue to make it better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=690)|
| 0:11:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=694)|
| 0:11:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=695)|
| 0:11:36| Thank you, Mr. Daniel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=696)|
| 0:11:37| Before you depart right there, I did want to say that for the people that are here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=697)|
| 0:11:41| these interviews are for the unexpired term and replacement that will fulfill the term that goes through 2013,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=701)|
| 0:11:51| October 31st of 2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=711)|
| 0:11:54| So these are all of these interviews are for that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=714)|
| 0:11:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=718)|
| 0:11:59| Do the commissioners have any questions for Mr. Daniel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=719)|
| 0:12:05| Looks like no questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=725)|
| 0:12:06| Thanks, Mr. Daniel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=726)|
| 0:12:07| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=727)|
| 0:12:08| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=728)|
| 0:12:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=730)|
| 0:12:11| Next person on the list is Steve Drevick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=731)|
| 0:12:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=741)|
| 0:12:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=742)|
| 0:12:23| I'm Steve Drevick, 5801 Meadow Glen Drive, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=743)|
| 0:12:28| Thanks again for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=748)|
| 0:12:30| I'd like to take a slightly different tact and spend a little bit of my time talking about an issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=750)|
| 0:12:35| that I think is a little more pressing than myself as a candidate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=755)|
| 0:12:38| And I'd e-mail the commission about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=758)|
| 0:12:40| I've appeared twice to the commission already regarding these appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=760)|
| 0:12:44| Mr. Drevick, if you don't mind, that's an item on our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=764)|
| 0:12:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=769)|
| 0:12:50| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=770)|
| 0:12:51| We want to entertain that at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=771)|
| 0:12:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=773)|
| 0:12:54| And I think that would make for a cleaner meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=774)|
| 0:12:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=776)|
| 0:12:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=777)|
| 0:12:58| Certainly, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=778)|
| 0:12:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=779)|
| 0:13:00| So I've lived here in Knoxville all of my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=780)|
| 0:13:03| I have a small business that does work around the country doing business with primarily government agencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=783)|
| 0:13:10| state, local, county, and municipal agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=790)|
| 0:13:13| And as part of my regular work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=793)|
| 0:13:16| I'm constantly having to ensure that my company complies with all of the local requirements for ethics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=796)|
| 0:13:24| non-influence, things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=804)|
| 0:13:26| So as part of that work, I get exposed on a very regular basis to how other municipalities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=806)|
| 0:13:32| and county agencies manage their ethics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=812)|
| 0:13:35| And some of them are very strong, very obtuse, and to be honest, they probably go a little bit too far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=815)|
| 0:13:41| Some of them are very, very lax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=821)|
| 0:13:43| But it's interesting to have that kind of perspective of all these other government agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=823)|
| 0:13:49| and what they do and what they don't do, what works well and what doesn't work well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=829)|
| 0:13:54| And I feel that that exposure, the exposure that I've had over that period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=834)|
| 0:13:57| I think would bring something to the committee and a perspective that I think would be helpful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=837)|
| 0:14:04| when potentially dealing with situations like that or looking at reviews of policies of what we have already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=844)|
| 0:14:11| So that's primarily what I think I'd like to contribute, and I appreciate your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=851)|
| 0:14:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=858)|
| 0:14:19| Thank you, Mr. Drabik.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=859)|
| 0:14:20| Do we have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=860)|
| 0:14:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=862)|
| 0:14:23| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=863)|
| 0:14:26| Steven Friedlander.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=866)|
| 0:14:34| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=874)|
| 0:14:35| My name is Steven Friedlander.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=875)|
| 0:14:37| I live at 8207 Galahar Station Drive here in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=877)|
| 0:14:42| and I am here today to once again affirm my interest in and my qualifications for serving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=882)|
| 0:14:49| on the Knox County Ethics Committee Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=889)|
| 0:14:53| I believe my work over the last 30 years qualifies me as a valuable candidate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=893)|
| 0:14:59| I worked for almost a decade in the world of Manhattan publishing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=899)|
| 0:15:03| and over the last two decades I have lived and worked here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=903)|
| 0:15:08| I relocated to Knoxville in 1988 to work at Whittle Communications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=908)|
| 0:15:17| and I had an opportunity to work closely with Chris Whittle on a variety of high-profile projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=917)|
| 0:15:24| including Channel One, the 12-minute news and information program for middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=924)|
| 0:15:29| school students, and the Edison Project Whittle's ambitious school redesign initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=929)|
| 0:15:36| At Edison, we understood and placed an emphasis on character and values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=936)|
| 0:15:42| In my life, I promote integrity and understand the need for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=942)|
| 0:15:46| and the role of ethics oversight in government and in business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=946)|
| 0:15:51| I've worked for large corporations, such as Scripps Howard, and small,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=951)|
| 0:15:55| independently-owned businesses, and I have adjudicated many issues in my various roles as an editor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=955)|
| 0:16:02| mentor, manager, CEO, and business owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=962)|
| 0:16:07| Today I own a small business, A3 Creative Group, an education-focused communications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=967)|
| 0:16:12| and marketing company working with foundations, associations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=972)|
| 0:16:17| and state departments of education across the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=977)|
| 0:16:22| I've read the Knox County Tennessee Code of Ethics and the requirements listed for the nine-member state-mandated panel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=982)|
| 0:16:28| I believe you will find my background and interest in serving Knoxville makes me a compelling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=988)|
| 0:16:33| and valuable candidate and a fresh and new voice to add to the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=993)|
| 0:16:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1000)|
| 0:16:42| Thank you, Mr. Freelander.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1002)|
| 0:16:43| Do we have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1003)|
| 0:16:46| I have a question to you and also for the former people, if you can just sort of let us know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1006)|
| 0:16:51| We're curious if it helps us to make this decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1011)|
| 0:16:53| Do you have any family members that work for Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1013)|
| 0:16:55| No, I do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1015)|
| 0:16:56| Do you have other people that Mr. Scott, have you got?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1016)|
| 0:17:05| A brother-in-law that works for the property assessor, is that what you said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1025)|
| 0:17:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1028)|
| 0:17:09| I'm assuming he's full-time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1029)|
| 0:17:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1031)|
| 0:17:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1033)|
| 0:17:14| Other questions for Mr. Freelander?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1034)|
| 0:17:16| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1036)|
| 0:17:20| Diane Gardner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1040)|
| 0:17:26| Lucille Griffo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1046)|
| 0:17:33| My name is Lucille Griffo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1053)|
| 0:17:34| I live at 3326 Monmouth Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1054)|
| 0:17:38| I'm here because, first of all, I'm retired now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1058)|
| 0:17:42| So I have a little bit more time to give back to the community, which is my passion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1062)|
| 0:17:47| And that's my major motivation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1067)|
| 0:17:50| Can I assume that you've got the bios?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1070)|
| 0:17:53| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1073)|
| 0:17:56| In my role as the CEO for the Girl Scouts, I've had ethics training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1076)|
| 0:18:02| And not a day goes by that we haven't had to make decisions based on some ethical issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1082)|
| 0:18:11| And so it's a passion for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1091)|
| 0:18:16| I've spent 40 years of my life devoted to the Girl Scouts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1096)|
| 0:18:20| And I'm now in a position where I have the time and the energy, and I'd like to give back to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1100)|
| 0:18:25| So I thought this might be an appropriate place for me to bring my skillset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1105)|
| 0:18:30| I appreciate your opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1110)|
| 0:18:33| I appreciate the opportunity to meet with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1113)|
| 0:18:35| We appreciate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1115)|
| 0:18:37| Any questions for Ms. Griffo?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1117)|
| 0:18:40| Lucille, I know the answer to this, but do you have any family members that work for Knox County Government?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1120)|
| 0:18:44| I do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1124)|
| 0:18:46| Thank you, Ms. Griffo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1126)|
| 0:18:49| Next, Ken Gross.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1129)|
| 0:18:54| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1134)|
| 0:18:55| My name is Ken Gross.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1135)|
| 0:18:56| I live at 12016 Butternut Lane in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1136)|
| 0:18:59| I want to thank the chairman and the commission for allowing me this opportunity to come before you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1139)|
| 0:19:03| and interview for the Ethics Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1143)|
| 0:19:05| I was one of the 25 applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1145)|
| 0:19:07| I was one of the 20 that appeared last week before the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1147)|
| 0:19:11| I'm more committed now than I was then as to why this appointment is so important to the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1151)|
| 0:19:18| One of the members last week made a statement that the Ethics Committee was somewhat of a paper tiger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1158)|
| 0:19:23| I found that a little bit interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1163)|
| 0:19:26| I've taken two appointed oath of office and elected oath of office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1166)|
| 0:19:29| and I take them very serious and very near and dear to my heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1169)|
| 0:19:32| I have that responsibility to the constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1172)|
| 0:19:35| I think for a committee to be credible, it has to lend credibility to itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1175)|
| 0:19:39| And I think the appointment that's going to be made to have a credible member to help build the Ethics Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1179)|
| 0:19:45| the General Assembly saw throughout the state where we had public officials that were violating the law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1185)|
| 0:19:50| violating their oath of office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1190)|
| 0:19:52| They took it upon themselves that we needed to have an ethics code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1192)|
| 0:19:55| They took it upon that we had to have an ethics committee that gave the citizens a fair balance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1195)|
| 0:20:00| that they could bring a complaint against an elected official or a county official,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1200)|
| 0:20:05| and it would be heard in an unbiased, fair, and professional manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1205)|
| 0:20:11| I served eight years as chairman of the State of Tennessee Occupational Safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1211)|
| 0:20:14| and Health Review Commission under two governors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1214)|
| 0:20:17| Our charge to adjudicate cases that came before us was to afford an unbiased, fair, and professional hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1217)|
| 0:20:26| In eight years, we took a lot of pride that we met that obligation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1226)|
| 0:20:29| We listened to the evidence that was presented before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1229)|
| 0:20:32| We made a just decision and a just ruling each and every time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1232)|
| 0:20:36| For the commission and any other standing body or committee, it has to have credibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1236)|
| 0:20:43| That's what we need in politics today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1243)|
| 0:20:45| That's what we need in government today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1245)|
| 0:20:47| People have to know that we have committees that will function and do the job that they were appointed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1247)|
| 0:20:53| I'm very interested in serving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1253)|
| 0:20:55| And I think I'll bring a lot of benefits, a lot of experience, and a lot of integrity to the ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1255)|
| 0:21:02| So I would appreciate your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1262)|
| 0:21:05| I look forward to answering any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1265)|
| 0:21:07| Commissioner Smith, no, I do not have anybody that works for county government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1267)|
| 0:21:12| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1272)|
| 0:21:13| Thank you, Mr. Gross.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1273)|
| 0:21:14| Other questions for Mr. Gross?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1274)|
| 0:21:17| Okay, thank you, Mr. Gross.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1277)|
| 0:21:18| We appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1278)|

| 0:21:26| Kayo Hurston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1286)|
| 0:21:31| Diane Jablonski.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1291)|
| 0:21:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1298)|
| 0:21:39| My name is Diane Jablonski.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1299)|
| 0:21:40| I live at 11640 South Monticello Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37934.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1300)|
| 0:21:48| I have come here today to withdraw my application for consideration to serve on the ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1308)|
| 0:21:54| And I would like to take this opportunity to tell you why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1314)|
| 0:21:58| I felt that this was the only way that I would be able to publicly air my disgust with the fiasco perpetrated on the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1318)|
| 0:22:06| by the so-called ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1326)|
| 0:22:09| I acknowledge the fact that they operated within their own rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1329)|
| 0:22:13| However, there is something unethical about a committee who deals with the public trust,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1333)|
| 0:22:19| appointing themselves to full terms of office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1339)|
| 0:22:24| The process of appointing the citizens to this and other committees is inherently flawed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1344)|
| 0:22:30| But for the moment, let's just focus on the ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1350)|
| 0:22:34| Public notice was made requesting citizens to submit an application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1354)|
| 0:22:38| and resume to the law department by October the 3rd with an open meeting to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1358)|
| 0:22:43| and review the candidates to be held on October the 10th for two vacancies to the nine-member board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1363)|
| 0:22:51| So far, so good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1371)|
| 0:22:53| Twenty-two applicants appeared before the committee at 8.30| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1373)|
| 0:22:57| and were given an opportunity to give a two-minute presentation in addition to their resumes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1377)|
| 0:23:03| I was so impressed by the caliber of people who had applied for these two positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1383)|
| 0:23:09| There were at least ten people whose qualifications were beyond excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1389)|
| 0:23:15| Their experience included educators, attorneys, mediators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1395)|
| 0:23:18| many of whom had served on the ethics committees in their own professions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1398)|
| 0:23:23| and many who would have been an asset to the Knox County Ethics Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1403)|
| 0:23:28| But what happened was a sham, a farce, and a fraud perpetrated on the citizens that applied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1408)|
| 0:23:35| This self-appointed ethics committee, in my opinion, did a great disservice to the Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1415)|
| 0:23:41| and to the citizens who appeared before them in good faith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1421)|
| 0:23:47| believing that they would have fair consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1427)|
| 0:23:50| What happened has unfortunately become the norm in Knox County where ethics is paper thin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1430)|
| 0:23:57| What did the ethics committee do to deserve this condemnation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1437)|
| 0:24:01| Primarily, they were completely dismissive to the superbly qualified candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1441)|
| 0:24:08| There were two vacancies on the ethics committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1448)|
| 0:24:11| and the only nominees considered were the two individuals who currently sit on the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1451)|
| 0:24:17| It was cut and dry, a done deal, and a huge insult to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1457)|
| 0:24:23| When I left the city county building to make my way back to the parking garage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1463)|
| 0:24:27| I was in the company of several gentlemen who had also sat through this fiasco.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1467)|
| 0:24:33| Their comments echoed my own thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1473)|
| 0:24:36| What a sham, a monumental waste of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1476)|
| 0:24:39| What a joke the fix was in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1479)|
| 0:24:42| And most often, they should be called the unethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1482)|
| 0:24:47| All I can add to that is that Knox County got another black eye in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1487)|
| 0:24:53| In my opinion, the current ethics committee should be disbanded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1493)|
| 0:24:57| They should not be self-appointed, and they should be term-limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1497)|
| 0:25:01| Reorganization and restructure of the ethics committee is your responsibility and obligation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1501)|
| 0:25:08| You currently have a minimum of 20 applicants to choose from in order to put in place a truly ethical ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1508)|
| 0:25:17| And I will not be one of them, but thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1517)|
| 0:25:20| Excuse me, Ms. Jablonski, do you want to go further?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1520)|
| 0:25:23| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1523)|
| 0:25:24| Since we will take this up in at least two places in our agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1524)|
| 0:25:28| we have a request by one of the commissioners to have a discussion item entered into the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1528)|
| 0:25:35| And then, of course, it's an item on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1535)|
| 0:25:38| So I'm sure we're going to have some speakers there at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1538)|
| 0:25:41| Of course, you're welcome to do that also then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1541)|
| 0:25:44| Oh, thank you, Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1544)|
| 0:25:45| I had finished my statement and would certainly answer any questions that you have at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1545)|
| 0:25:51| I do have to leave in order to go and pick up my granddaughter, so I won't be able to stay for your full workshop meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1551)|
| 0:25:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1558)|
| 0:25:59| Well, thank you, and we appreciate this information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1559)|
| 0:26:03| But, again, we're going to take this up in just a few minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1563)|
| 0:26:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1566)|
| 0:26:07| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1567)|
| 0:26:14| Okay, next on our list is Ellen Locurto-Martinez.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1574)|
| 0:26:24| I'm sorry if I butchered that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1584)|
| 0:26:26| You did pretty well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1586)|
| 0:26:27| I'm impressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1587)|
| 0:26:29| Thank you for allowing us to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1589)|
| 0:26:31| My name is Ellen Locurto-Martinez, 5514 Golden Gate Road, obviously in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1591)|
| 0:26:37| And, again, I was one of the 25 or 22, whoever it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1597)|
| 0:26:41| I just really feel compelled to be here and to want to be part of this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1601)|
| 0:26:48| I'm sure you have my bio, so it's kind of long, 25, 30 years, so I'll kind of break it down to chunks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1608)|
| 0:26:54| The most recent was when I was in Missouri.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1614)|
| 0:26:56| I was chairman of the newly created Citizens Police Review Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1616)|
| 0:27:00| And as we worked on our policies and procedures and bylaws,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1620)|
| 0:27:04| we really had to struggle with what were our own personal ethics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1624)|
| 0:27:07| and what ethics should we have for our citizens and police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1627)|
| 0:27:10| Because, as you can imagine, as we investigated the complaints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1630)|
| 0:27:13| we had to deal with the citizens' perspective and their complaint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1633)|
| 0:27:16| as well as how do we also uphold our police department, and obviously going along with their policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1636)|
| 0:27:21| and procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1641)|
| 0:27:22| So it struggled a lot, and we really had a lot of probably hair wrangling as far as, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1642)|
| 0:27:28| what we really thought were the best ethics and policies to handle those complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1648)|
| 0:27:33| In another life, I was a marketing director for a CPA firm and then later on a law firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1653)|
| 0:27:37| And as a marketing director, I did not do TV or, you know, radio commercials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1657)|
| 0:27:42| But we met with the public, and how we dealt ethically with them, what we could say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1662)|
| 0:27:46| and what we couldn't say was topmost for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1666)|
| 0:27:49| And I was very impressed with my CPAs and attorneys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1669)|
| 0:27:52| They held by their ethics very strongly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1672)|
| 0:27:55| I also was executive director for non-for-profit organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1675)|
| 0:27:59| And in that position, you really have to be on your toes as far as ethics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1679)|
| 0:28:03| Because, as we all know, perception is reality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1683)|
| 0:28:07| And I always wore my we always had a conflict of interest policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1687)|
| 0:28:11| But sometimes board members and maybe staff didn't quite understand what that meant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1691)|
| 0:28:15| I always told my board members, lean on the side of being conservative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1695)|
| 0:28:18| If there was any doubt that it might be a conflict of interest, recuse yourself or abstain from voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1698)|
| 0:28:23| So that was always one of the things that was most critical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1703)|
| 0:28:26| And I'm also a doctoral student here at UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1706)|
| 0:28:29| My husband's a professor here, and I'm a doctoral student in public administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1709)|
| 0:28:33| So you can imagine that everything we talk about, whether it's finance or running a city, it's all tied to ethics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1713)|
| 0:28:39| So I really want to be part of the process here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1719)|
| 0:28:41| I want to be one of the citizens that help Knoxville grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1721)|
| 0:28:44| And obviously, holding our officials to high standards is a part of democratic function,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1724)|
| 0:28:49| and I'd like to be part of the citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1729)|
| 0:28:51| Thank you, and no, I don't have any relatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1731)|
| 0:28:54| I don't have any relatives in service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1734)|
| 0:28:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1739)|
| 0:29:00| Thank you, Ms. Martinez.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1740)|
| 0:29:01| Any other questions for Ms. Martinez?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1741)|
| 0:29:03| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1743)|
| 0:29:07| Michael McDaniel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1747)|
| 0:29:12| Marion McGrath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1752)|
| 0:29:19| Jesse Nelson Kenneth Scarborough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1759)|
| 0:29:27| Billy Stevens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1767)|
| 0:29:32| And then the next name is Neil Stewart, who is here but just wanted to alert that he sent a message that he still wants to be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1772)|
| 0:29:43| Douglas Viem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1783)|
| 0:29:48| Wayne Waters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1788)|
| 0:29:54| Okay, and that's all I have on my list to be interviewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1794)|
| 0:29:59| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1799)|
| 0:30:01| Come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1801)|
| 0:30:04| As I was sitting here, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1804)|
| 0:30:05| In response to Commissioner Smith's question, I was thinking it over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1805)|
| 0:30:08| and actually I wanted to let the commission know that my father, Harold L. Daniel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1808)|
| 0:30:13| as a second career actually does work part time at the county clerk's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1813)|
| 0:30:17| I'd initially answered your question, no, and I just wasn't, I just inadvertently made the mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1817)|
| 0:30:22| He works part time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1822)|
| 0:30:23| He works part time, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1823)|
| 0:30:25| I apologize for the mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1825)|
| 0:30:28| Okay, thank you, Mr. Daniel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1828)|
| 0:30:29| Any other items here or things to consider in this process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1829)|
| 0:30:35| Okay, seeing none, then this meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1835)|
| 0:30:38| We'll reconvene at 2 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1838)|
| 0:30:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1839)|
| 0:30:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1848)|
| 0:30:55| October work session to order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1855)|
| 0:30:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1858)|
| 0:31:05| Okay, and before everybody takes their seat, we're going to pledge to the flag| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1865)|

| 0:31:25| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1885)|
| 0:31:30| and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1890)|
| 0:31:46| Okay, thank you for your attendance today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1906)|
| 0:31:48| And the first item is amendments to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1908)|
| 0:31:52| One item that we need to defer until after the workshop or at 3.30,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1912)|
| 0:32:00| whichever comes first is item 110, which is number four on our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1920)|
| 0:32:05| And this is our committee on committees that has to be publicly noticed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1925)|
| 0:32:12| So we'll do that if there's no objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1932)|
| 0:32:16| And then other amendments to agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1936)|
| 0:32:19| Ms. Brolls?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1939)|
| 0:32:21| Yes, I'd like to add a discussion item regarding the ethics committee appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1941)|
| 0:32:27| Okay, we'll have a discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1947)|
| 0:32:29| And that will take up that item or that item may be included in the agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1949)|
| 0:32:38| So if it's necessary, we'll continue with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1958)|
| 0:32:43| Mr. Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1963)|

| 0:32:52| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1972)|
| 0:32:53| He mentioned this morning that they would like to postpone the Middlebrook Pike property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1973)|
| 0:33:00| I'm looking for the number here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1980)|
| 0:33:02| You probably know which one it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1982)|
| 0:33:05| Chris may know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1985)|
| 0:33:10| Because they want to do a little more research on the actual ownership, whether it's not schooled or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1990)|
| 0:33:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1997)|
| 0:33:19| We want to postpone for 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=1999)|
| 0:33:22| I'd probably do it, bud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2002)|
| 0:33:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2004)|

| 0:34:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2040)|
| 0:34:01| I don't know anything about the insolvency board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2041)|

| 0:36:48| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2208)|
| 0:36:49| I skipped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2209)|

| 0:37:37| We have some people here that I think would possibly like to speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2257)|
| 0:37:50| Well, Mr. Drevick is here, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2270)|
| 0:37:55| Would you like to speak, Steve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2275)|
| 0:37:59| Do the name and address thing again, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2279)|
| 0:38:02| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2282)|
| 0:38:03| Steve Drevick, 5801 Meadow Glen Drive here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2283)|
| 0:38:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2287)|
| 0:38:08| Thank you again for the opportunity to address this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2288)|
| 0:38:12| Diane, for those of you, was a hard act to follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2292)|
| 0:38:15| I think she very well expressed for some of the commissioners that weren't here when Diane spoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2295)|
| 0:38:19| I'll briefly reiterate I think an objection that her and I both shared of the meeting last Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2299)|
| 0:38:27| Before I begin, somebody had pointed out when I mentioned about a relative working,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2307)|
| 0:38:33| I said it was my brother-in-law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2313)|
| 0:38:34| It was actually my wife's sister's husband, which I was informed is not technically my brother-in-law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2314)|
| 0:38:40| so I thought I would go ahead and clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2320)|
| 0:38:42| He's like a brother-in-law to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2322)|
| 0:38:46| So the question came to what we felt, what a number of us felt was a pressing problem with the rules of committee itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2326)|
| 0:38:55| As you may know, the committee met last week to consider two unexpired terms appointed by the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2335)|
| 0:39:00| In addition to the two existing members, we had 22 or 23 applicants, many of which were extremely qualified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2340)|
| 0:39:07| and would have added greatly to the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2347)|
| 0:39:10| As you may know, when it came time for the two round of nominations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2350)|
| 0:39:13| the committee only considered their existing members in both of the rounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2353)|
| 0:39:17| So none of the two, none of the outside applicants were given the opportunity to be voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2357)|
| 0:39:22| It left many of the outside applicants feeling incredulous, feeling discouraged,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2362)|
| 0:39:28| and that we had wasted our time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2368)|
| 0:39:31| The Ethics Committee has become an important symbol of our determination to improve things here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2371)|
| 0:39:37| to make things better here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2377)|
| 0:39:39| Six years ago, we were talking about lobster dinners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2379)|
| 0:39:41| We were talking about slush funds and Black Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2381)|
| 0:39:44| We've come a long way since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2384)|
| 0:39:46| And we don't want to undermine our accomplishments by having the perception of an eternally self-perpetuating Ethics Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2386)|
| 0:39:54| I understand today that there is an encompassing ordinance that does limit committees to two terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2394)|
| 0:40:01| I think it would be important that we review that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2401)|
| 0:40:03| and make sure there's no limiting language if it were to say, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2403)|
| 0:40:08| limiting two terms for positions appointed by the commission or the mayor or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2408)|
| 0:40:12| And I'm sure the law director will speak to that shortly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2412)|
| 0:40:16| But I'm glad to hear that there is something that may cover that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2416)|
| 0:40:20| But I would also potentially recommend a change to eliminate the option for committee members to vote for their own reappointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2420)|
| 0:40:27| The change is really more symbolic rather than method.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2427)|
| 0:40:30| If an Ethics Committee is to oversee conflicts of interest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2430)|
| 0:40:33| it just seems to an outsider that voting to reappoint yourself, it just sends the wrong message to the average person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2433)|
| 0:40:40| And if the Ethics Committee is to be our symbol of how we write things in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2440)|
| 0:40:44| how we go past where we were six years ago, I think that's an important step to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2444)|
| 0:40:50| And let me be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2450)|
| 0:40:51| In no means do I mean to question the qualifications of the people on the committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2451)|
| 0:40:56| the committee itself, or their ability to reappoint themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2456)|
| 0:41:01| Rather, like I said, it was more of a symbolic situation that I think we can address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2461)|
| 0:41:09| and may partly already be addressed by that other ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2469)|
| 0:41:13| So I appreciate your time to consider this effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2473)|
| 0:41:17| I think it's the committee itself, the work that we've done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2477)|
| 0:41:22| drafting the ethics policy has been a great move forward for Knox County, a little bit of tweaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2482)|
| 0:41:28| And I think we can make things even a little bit better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2488)|
| 0:41:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2490)|
| 0:41:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2491)|
| 0:41:32| Thank you, Mr. Drevick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2492)|
| 0:41:33| We've got several lights on, so hang in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2493)|
| 0:41:34| There may be questions for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2494)|
| 0:41:36| Mr. McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2496)|
| 0:41:39| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2499)|
| 0:41:40| And I appreciate Mr. Drevick's thoughtful e-mail as well as Ms. Jablonski's comments at our 1 o'clock meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2500)|
| 0:41:51| Before I take some action, I've got a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2511)|
| 0:41:55| And these questions are to the people that were at the ethics, this last week's ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2515)|
| 0:42:01| During the Mrs. Davis is the chair, correct, of the ethics committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2521)|
| 0:42:07| Did she recuse herself from the dialogue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2527)|
| 0:42:13| Not from the dialogue, but from the chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2533)|
| 0:42:15| Just from the chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2535)|
| 0:42:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2536)|
| 0:42:17| But not from the dialogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2537)|
| 0:42:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2538)|
| 0:42:19| You know, again, I tend to agree with the two applicants in that this is very problematic, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2539)|
| 0:42:31| not questioning the qualifications of the members, but this just doesn't seem right the way it rolled itself out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2551)|
| 0:42:45| So I'm going to introduce a substitute motion that we deny this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2565)|
| 0:42:55| And I think, you know, I think they need to go back and probably send us maybe even the same names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2575)|
| 0:43:04| But I think this process wasn't as open and transparent as it could have been and should have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2584)|
| 0:43:14| So I'm going to make a substitute motion that we deny this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2594)|
| 0:43:18| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2598)|
| 0:43:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2601)|
| 0:43:24| Dr. Briggs, Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2604)|
| 0:43:26| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2606)|
| 0:43:28| Just for everyone out there or the folks that may be watching this on television, there were, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2608)|
| 0:43:36| I think we really need to talk about, first of all, what the composition of the ethics committee is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2616)|
| 0:43:41| and who the members are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2621)|
| 0:43:43| And I'm going to just repeat these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2623)|
| 0:43:46| Some of you may know this already, but just so everyone knows what the ethics committee consists of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2626)|
| 0:43:53| there's nine members of the ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2633)|
| 0:43:56| One is a member of the Knox County Commission that's appointed by the Knox County Commission, and presently that's me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2636)|
| 0:44:04| The second is an employee of the Knox County Sheriff's Office that's appointed by the Knox County Sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2644)|
| 0:44:12| So we have seven remaining citizens who are then they have to be residents of Knox County and Knox County voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2652)|
| 0:44:20| They're not employees of Knox County, and they're not supposed to be related to any elected official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2660)|
| 0:44:26| Now, this is spouse, sibling, parent, or child is how that's defined to any elected official of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2666)|
| 0:44:33| Three of the citizens are appointed by the Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2673)|
| 0:44:38| Two of the citizens are appointed by the Knox County Mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2678)|
| 0:44:43| and two citizens are appointed by the Knox County Ethics Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2683)|
| 0:44:46| And these appointments that are in question are the two appointments that are made by the Knox County Ethics Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2686)|
| 0:44:53| And that's what that process was that took place on the past Wednesday that we're deliberating on now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2693)|
| 0:45:00| And the questions also come up about term limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2700)|
| 0:45:03| And I've asked the Knox County Law Director to please comment on what term does the ethics committee have term limits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2703)|
| 0:45:11| and what they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2711)|
| 0:45:14| Thank you, Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2714)|
| 0:45:16| Their procedures do not address term limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2716)|
| 0:45:20| However, the charter addresses term limits through county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2720)|
| 0:45:23| And county commission establishes boards and committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2723)|
| 0:45:28| And those committees and boards have term limits of two consecutive terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2728)|
| 0:45:34| If they're two-year terms, it's two consecutive terms of eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2734)|
| 0:45:39| If they're two-year terms, it's two terms or eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2739)|
| 0:45:43| So they would actually get four consecutive two-year terms to be term limited in this particular committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2743)|
| 0:45:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2751)|
| 0:45:52| Thank you, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2752)|
| 0:45:54| And then I was not at the unfortunately I could not make the meeting that we had where these candidates were considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2754)|
| 0:46:02| But I really hate to make any other comments about whether the process was fair or not because I wasn't there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2762)|
| 0:46:10| But that's the resolution that we're talking about right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2770)|
| 0:46:16| Mr. Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2776)|
| 0:46:18| Mr. Law Director, I'm assuming one of your associates or employees were there at the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2778)|
| 0:46:24| Did they operate within the law?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2784)|
| 0:46:26| I mean, their rules and the law?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2786)|
| 0:46:30| Mr. Commissioner, it was kind of a split scene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2790)|
| 0:46:34| I was there for the second half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2794)|
| 0:46:36| We had a representative there for me for the first half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2796)|
| 0:46:40| What happened was they actually followed the process and the procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2800)|
| 0:46:46| Both candidates were disclosed as participating and both candidates were disclosed as voting members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2806)|
| 0:46:52| They had a quorum there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2812)|
| 0:46:54| And beyond that, there really wasn't much in terms of a legality that I could do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2814)|
| 0:47:00| They voted and nominated and selected their candidates according to the process, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2820)|
| 0:47:08| You know, I agree with Commissioner McKenzie wholeheartedly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2828)|
| 0:47:11| I think the process, I mean, if you're on the committee and you can vote yourself back on the committee, I think that's flawed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2831)|
| 0:47:17| I think the term should expire and then those that are left on the committee should appoint the next people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2837)|
| 0:47:23| I don't know that we have, if they follow the law and everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2843)|
| 0:47:27| I don't know that we have the right to, you know, throw these names back to them because I, you know, ratifying the appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2847)|
| 0:47:36| I mean, what if we don't ratify the appointments, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2856)|
| 0:47:39| What happens then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2859)|
| 0:47:41| Well, you have the, let's see, how's the term?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2861)|
| 0:47:46| You have the power to terminate any position, person on a committee for just cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2866)|
| 0:47:53| You all will have to determine what that just cause is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2873)|
| 0:47:58| If you don't ratify them right now, these terms begin next month, I believe, do they not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2878)|
| 0:48:06| Then they will be short at least two and it would impair them having a quorum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2886)|
| 0:48:12| and part of the membership would not be represented, which is the committee itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2892)|
| 0:48:18| So it's up to the pleasure of the county commission as to how you proceed, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2898)|
| 0:48:24| We could theoretically split, put Captain Cox on, split the question, put Captain Cox on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2904)|
| 0:48:29| and the other two not ratify and then they would have an empty, they'd have two empty seats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2909)|
| 0:48:34| Go ahead, Mr. Buick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2914)|
| 0:48:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2916)|
| 0:48:37| I was the, from the first half of the meeting and to fill in on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2917)|
| 0:48:42| The ethics committee, you can change how you want to make up the ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2922)|
| 0:48:47| But the way that this commission has set it up, there is, of course, as you mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2927)|
| 0:48:51| Commissioner Anders, one member appointed by Knox County Sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2931)|
| 0:48:56| The mayor gets two appointments to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2936)|
| 0:49:00| That comes out of his office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2940)|
| 0:49:02| And then one commissioner by Knox County, which you're voting on today, which comes from the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2942)|
| 0:49:08| And then it says within this ordinance, which you can change if you want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2948)|
| 0:49:16| two citizen members appointed by the Knox County Ethics Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2956)|
| 0:49:21| So as the law director pointed out, everything was done according to law and according to this document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2961)|
| 0:49:29| Now, if the commission and the public have a problem with the committee appointing its own two members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2969)|
| 0:49:37| you certainly have the power to change that at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2977)|
| 0:49:41| But everything was done according to Hoyle at that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2981)|
| 0:49:48| Brad, just in way of a comment, I would be willing to rephrase my substitute motion to allow Captain Cox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2988)|
| 0:49:59| If you want to read it to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=2999)|
| 0:50:01| I mean, that sounds like it gets us to where we want to go without.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3001)|
| 0:50:05| I mean, they followed their rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3005)|
| 0:50:06| We just don't like their rules and the way they did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3006)|
| 0:50:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3010)|
| 0:50:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3013)|
| 0:50:14| Do we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3014)|
| 0:50:15| So we've amended the second agrees to remove Captain Cox from the motion to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3015)|
| 0:50:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3024)|
| 0:50:25| Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3025)|
| 0:50:27| Mr. Chairman, I have long advocated that we should have nine citizens on the Ethics Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3027)|
| 0:50:31| and no county employees at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3031)|
| 0:50:33| And I came to that conclusion after having served on the Ethics Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3033)|
| 0:50:36| on the very first Ethics Committee that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3036)|
| 0:50:38| And I still believe that and believe that that would be in the best interest of our citizens to have nine citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3038)|
| 0:50:45| I also question the notion of having the Ethics Committee select its own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3045)|
| 0:50:51| So I am in favor of perhaps, if nothing else, delaying this for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3051)|
| 0:50:58| But I would like to look at the whole structure of the Ethics Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3058)|
| 0:51:02| and let's look and see if any changes need to be made at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3062)|
| 0:51:05| because it seems to me now is the time to take a look at it and see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3065)|
| 0:51:07| And if we want to make changes and I would like to advocate some changes, now may be the time to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3067)|
| 0:51:17| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3077)|
| 0:51:20| I punched right in and got right off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3080)|
| 0:51:21| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3081)|
| 0:51:22| I didn't see Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3082)|
| 0:51:23| Hold on then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3083)|
| 0:51:24| Amy, you're up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3084)|
| 0:51:26| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3086)|
| 0:51:28| I just was going to say exactly the same thing that Mike said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3088)|
| 0:51:32| I think that we need to look at the makeup of the committee and how the members are appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3092)|
| 0:51:39| So if we do not ratify this today, I would like for someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3099)|
| 0:51:48| or a group of someone to get together before next month and put something on next month's agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3108)|
| 0:51:54| reworking how we do the Ethics Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3114)|
| 0:51:58| I agree with you completely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3118)|
| 0:51:59| It should be all citizens, and I don't think that the committee should be appointing people to itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3119)|
| 0:52:08| So that would be, I would love to see that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3128)|
| 0:52:11| I support you in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3131)|
| 0:52:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3133)|
| 0:52:14| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3134)|
| 0:52:17| First-time caller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3137)|
| 0:52:19| Long-time listener, first-time caller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3139)|
| 0:52:21| So noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3141)|
| 0:52:24| What else was on the agenda of the Ethics Committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3144)|
| 0:52:28| Do they have ongoing work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3148)|
| 0:52:31| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3151)|
| 0:52:31| Then I agree that we should put all of this on hold and look at it all in total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3151)|
| 0:52:39| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3159)|
| 0:52:42| My question would be reflected by the comments of both Commissioner Brosh| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3162)|
| 0:52:48| and Commissioner Wright, the fact that if there's nothing pending, it doesn't keep us from moving it out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3168)|
| 0:52:57| But my other question was, is that if they do have something pending, if we leave these two off today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3177)|
| 0:53:06| would it curtail their meeting for where they have a quorum for the next one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3186)|
| 0:53:11| It should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3191)|
| 0:53:12| So if they don't have anything pending, then it's kind of a moot point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3192)|
| 0:53:18| Mr. Law Director, do you have a comment there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3198)|
| 0:53:21| Well, the quorum is only a majority of the membership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3201)|
| 0:53:24| And if they've got seven or six and they show up and they can conduct business where they have the two vacancies or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3204)|
| 0:53:30| or three would put it right at the quorum, you'd have to have 100% of the membership really show to have a quorum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3210)|
| 0:53:36| or 100% of the remaining membership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3216)|
| 0:53:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3219)|
| 0:53:40| We remove Cox from the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3220)|
| 0:53:42| Mr. Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3222)|
| 0:53:44| You know, I started to mention this before, and I'm sorry to have to come back to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3224)|
| 0:53:48| The only problem, and I agree with a lot of what everyone has said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3228)|
| 0:53:52| and I agree very strongly with what Commissioner Hammond said, he said on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3232)|
| 0:53:57| and I believe that we should have all citizens on there and not people that are involved in the government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3237)|
| 0:54:04| When we were more active two years ago, we had one incident where I think six of the nine people had to recuse themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3244)|
| 0:54:14| from a ruling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3254)|
| 0:54:17| And I think he was perfectly ethical in doing this and perfectly right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3257)|
| 0:54:22| but the appointee from the sheriff's office on every single thing that we were involved with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3262)|
| 0:54:27| he had to recuse himself because he knew somebody or had a personal relationship with someone just because you work here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3267)|
| 0:54:33| in the county courthouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3273)|
| 0:54:35| The only problem I have with changing the rules after the fact, it's sort of an ex post facto deal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3275)|
| 0:54:43| is that we had a legal meeting that was done exactly according to the rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3283)|
| 0:54:50| and the appointments were made by the appropriate body according to the charter of the ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3290)|
| 0:54:55| And then after this was done, and believe me, I don't like the way this is any more than anyone else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3295)|
| 0:55:02| but there is a sense of fairness that after it's all finished, now because we don't like the results of the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3302)|
| 0:55:10| we're saying we're going to say they're void.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3310)|
| 0:55:16| And we're going to change it so somebody else is elected there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3316)|
| 0:55:19| And I just have a question of whether that's ethical, after the fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3319)|
| 0:55:23| to change the result of a process that was completely legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3323)|
| 0:55:28| And I do, and I absolutely believe that we need to review this, but I'm just not sure we should overturn the results of a legal process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3328)|
| 0:55:35| and say, you know, we need to do something else because we don't like the results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3335)|
| 0:55:40| But it was legal to the point of up to us ratifying it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3340)|
| 0:55:45| If it's not ratified by this body, it doesn't matter what you put in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3345)|
| 0:55:49| Well, I'll let wiser minds than me look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3349)|
| 0:55:53| But, I mean, the process was exactly as it was supposed to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3353)|
| 0:55:57| I mean, it was an open process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3357)|
| 0:56:00| The ethics committee is under the Open Meetings Act, like everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3360)|
| 0:56:03| The people on there have been counseled on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3363)|
| 0:56:05| There really, you know, there wasn't any deal before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3365)|
| 0:56:08| I mean, I wasn't there, but I think what the feeling are is that the people that have served on the committee, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3368)|
| 0:56:14| were qualified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3374)|
| 0:56:15| One of them, I believe, is her civilian, her citizen's job is as an ethicist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3375)|
| 0:56:21| And I think that's what it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3381)|
| 0:56:26| You know, you don't fire someone, really, unless you think they've done a bad job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3386)|
| 0:56:30| But just now to change the rules afterwards and say we're going to redo it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3390)|
| 0:56:35| I mean, I think we really do need to sit down and look at the ethics committee and the composition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3395)|
| 0:56:39| I think it needs to be all citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3399)|
| 0:56:41| I think that we need to have a different mechanism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3401)|
| 0:56:43| But I just don't know if it's right to do it after the fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3403)|
| 0:56:47| Ms. Broils.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3407)|
| 0:56:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3408)|
| 0:56:49| I don't have a problem with doing it after the fact for two reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3409)|
| 0:56:52| One is that it's our job to ratify this or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3412)|
| 0:56:57| If what we thought wasn't important, we wouldn't have to do that step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3417)|
| 0:57:02| But we can choose to ratify it or we can choose not to ratify it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3422)|
| 0:57:05| just the way that the states can choose to ratify or not when there's going to be a change or amendment to the Constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3425)|
| 0:57:12| Also, whether or not it was done legally reminds me a great deal of what we heard after Black Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3432)|
| 0:57:19| All of those appointments were done completely legally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3439)|
| 0:57:24| And yet the, well, yeah, but the process that took place during the meeting was done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3444)|
| 0:57:34| and the courts said that that was not, that it was not done properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3454)|
| 0:57:41| So I don't have a problem with us coming behind and saying this doesn't meet our standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3461)|
| 0:57:46| That's what our role is as the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3466)|
| 0:57:48| Otherwise, it wouldn't be coming before us in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3468)|
| 0:57:53| Mr. Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3473)|
| 0:57:55| One last comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3475)|
| 0:57:56| This is no different than an MPC legal decision coming before us for ratification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3476)|
| 0:58:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3487)|
| 0:58:08| We have a motion to deny all those appointments except for Mr. Tom Cox before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3488)|
| 0:58:17| Let's have a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3497)|
| 0:58:23| Darden, the first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3503)|
| 0:58:26| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3506)|
| 0:58:27| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3507)|
| 0:58:28| Commissioner McKenzie votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3508)|
| 0:58:30| Commissioner Brawls?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3510)|
| 0:58:31| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3511)|
| 0:58:32| Commissioner Brawls votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3512)|
| 0:58:33| Commissioner Ornby?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3513)|
| 0:58:35| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3515)|
| 0:58:36| Commissioner Ornby votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3516)|
| 0:58:38| Commissioner Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3518)|
| 0:58:40| Because the, you know, the question came up of ethics committee members voting for themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3520)|
| 0:58:44| in this so that I, maybe I should have recused myself before I spoke,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3524)|
| 0:58:48| but I'm going to recuse myself from this vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3528)|
| 0:58:52| Commissioner Briggs recuses himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3532)|
| 0:58:55| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3535)|
| 0:58:56| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3536)|
| 0:58:57| Commissioner Anders votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3537)|
| 0:58:59| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3539)|
| 0:59:00| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3540)|
| 0:59:01| Commissioner Smith votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3541)|
| 0:59:02| Commissioner Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3542)|
| 0:59:03| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3543)|
| 0:59:04| Commissioner Wright votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3544)|
| 0:59:05| Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3545)|
| 0:59:06| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3546)|
| 0:59:07| Commissioner Brown votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3547)|
| 0:59:09| Commissioner Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3549)|
| 0:59:10| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3550)|
| 0:59:11| Commissioner Hammond votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3551)|
| 0:59:12| Commissioner Shouse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3552)|
| 0:59:13| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3553)|
| 0:59:14| Commissioner Shouse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3554)|
| 0:59:15| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3555)|
| 0:59:16| Commissioner Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3556)|
| 0:59:17| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3557)|
| 0:59:18| Commissioner Norman votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3558)|
| 0:59:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3564)|
| 0:59:25| Nine to one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3565)|
| 0:59:26| One recusal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3566)|
| 0:59:27| So the motion, that motion passes to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3567)|
| 0:59:32| Now I move that we appoint Captain Tom Cox to the ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3572)|
| 0:59:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3582)|
| 0:59:43| Do we have a motion to appoint Tom Cox?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3583)|
| 0:59:45| I hear a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3585)|
| 0:59:46| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3586)|
| 0:59:47| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3587)|
| 0:59:49| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3589)|
| 0:59:50| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3590)|
| 0:59:51| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3591)|
| 0:59:52| So Tom Cox is appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3592)|
| 0:59:55| Do we need a motion now to is that your next thing to set a committee to do this thing together?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3595)|
| 1:00:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3602)|
| 1:00:03| Mr. Law Director, do you have some guidance for us now with in reference to these two other positions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3603)|
| 1:00:13| If I might, Mr. Chairman, I've got a little bit of I understand where everybody wants to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3613)|
| 1:00:20| but I've got a little bit of a churning stomach on this because under the code of ethics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3620)|
| 1:00:27| and the ethics committee that's been established, there's no provision in there for ratification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3627)|
| 1:00:35| It's not one of these upon advice and consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3635)|
| 1:00:38| It just simply says that the commission shall appoint two members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3638)|
| 1:00:43| It gives this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3643)|
| 1:00:46| I'm talking about the ethics commission shall appoint two members from its however it wants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3646)|
| 1:00:52| Insofar as that the wording is not what this commission obviously would desire, it's still there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3652)|
| 1:01:00| This commission being the county commission has no authority under this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3660)|
| 1:01:07| to approve what the ethics committee did in its appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3667)|
| 1:01:14| So that's the first bit of heartburn I have, whether you like it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3674)|
| 1:01:19| I ask for clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3679)|
| 1:01:20| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3680)|
| 1:01:21| What you're saying is no matter what we think about the process or what vote we take next Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3681)|
| 1:01:26| it doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3686)|
| 1:01:27| They're on the board because they appointed them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3687)|
| 1:01:29| That's the way I read what's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3689)|
| 1:01:32| We could have concluded that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3692)|
| 1:01:33| Then why is this on our agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3693)|
| 1:01:34| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3694)|
| 1:01:35| That's what I'm going to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3695)|
| 1:01:35| I'm going to ask for a little bit of order on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3695)|
| 1:01:37| Why does this item appear before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3697)|
| 1:01:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3700)|
| 1:01:41| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3701)|
| 1:01:42| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3702)|
| 1:01:43| I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3703)|
| 1:01:44| The only reason that this is on the agenda is because traditionally these kind of items have been spread upon the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3704)|
| 1:01:51| minutes of the commission for purposes of keeping track of it in the clerk's office, among other reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3711)|
| 1:01:58| That's the only understanding I have and not having been here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3718)|
| 1:02:04| Secondly, there's a in your rules when you denied this motion, rule number 12 under section O,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3724)|
| 1:02:15| says any agenda item that fails in the agenda work session committee shall be removed from the commission agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3735)|
| 1:02:23| So it's gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3743)|
| 1:02:24| It's not deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3744)|
| 1:02:25| I got the sense that what you all wanted to do was defer all of this stuff so you could look at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3745)|
| 1:02:31| and see about amending it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3751)|
| 1:02:32| And the secondary question would be, and I do not, this also gives me some heartburn that needs some legal research,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3752)|
| 1:02:40| is whether once this committee has chosen under law its two members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3760)|
| 1:02:46| And I wasn't here, so I don't even know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3766)|
| 1:02:48| I guess they chose two of their own members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3768)|
| 1:02:51| Having done that, does this commission have authority under state law to shorten their terms?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3771)|
| 1:02:57| There's a general state law that says you cannot shorten any term of any committee or any commissioner or what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3777)|
| 1:03:04| There's a lot of legal issues that you brought up today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3784)|
| 1:03:07| and all I can say is some of them give me a little bit of heartburn in totally denying this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3787)|
| 1:03:15| And where do you go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3795)|
| 1:03:16| Now, Mr. Armstrong was correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3796)|
| 1:03:18| As long as something comes up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3798)|
| 1:03:20| and nothing I don't think has been on the ethics committee for two years, something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3800)|
| 1:03:26| So there's plenty of time for this commission to sit there and figure out what they're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3806)|
| 1:03:31| But Ms. McKenzie's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3811)|
| 1:03:33| Why was it on the agenda if we don't or aren't in a position to be authorizing or approving those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3813)|
| 1:03:41| And that's the only answer I've heard or understood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3821)|
| 1:03:44| Somebody else may enlighten me on that because I haven't been here for six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3824)|
| 1:03:50| But keep in mind that those items that I just raised can cause some legal heartburn, at least in the law director's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3830)|
| 1:03:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3838)|
| 1:03:59| Thank you, Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3839)|
| 1:04:04| I am totally perplexed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3844)|
| 1:04:12| We had discussion, and I think that's where Commissioner Brown was going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3852)|
| 1:04:16| We had discussion about the next steps in terms of a lot of us on this panel don't feel that the make-up process is correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3856)|
| 1:04:27| and the appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3867)|
| 1:04:28| And I think that's where we were going, trying to figure out what kind of subcommittee are we going to do in the interim| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3868)|
| 1:04:35| to get the ethics committee formulated the way that, you know, we feel the people want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3875)|
| 1:04:44| So I think that was that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3884)|
| 1:04:46| But I think the vote was clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3886)|
| 1:04:48| The vote was, as these words say, that the commission will ratify the appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3888)|
| 1:04:57| It's not ambiguous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3897)|
| 1:04:59| It's not, you know, it's pretty clear that we voted, that we were asked to ratify three people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3899)|
| 1:05:08| And what we did was not ratify two and ratified one of the persons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3908)|
| 1:05:13| I mean, we have committees all over that that's what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3913)|
| 1:05:18| We can't tell them what to do, but we can go up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3918)|
| 1:05:21| We'll send it back to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3921)|
| 1:05:22| And, again, they may, after a process, deliver the same two names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3922)|
| 1:05:28| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3928)|
| 1:05:29| We, I feel, well, I won't speak for us, but I think I heard that, but that the process was flawed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3929)|
| 1:05:35| I don't think that, you know, given something this significant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3935)|
| 1:05:39| I don't think any member up here today would have stayed in the conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3939)|
| 1:05:45| and voted on ourselves for something like this, to be reappointed to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3945)|
| 1:05:50| You know, and we're going to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3950)|
| 1:05:52| So I just think that this is a subcommittee of commission, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3952)|
| 1:05:57| it's something that we were, you know, we give instruction that we have some influence, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3957)|
| 1:06:05| at least in the makeup, that this is pretty disheartening to come afterwards to have something sit before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3965)|
| 1:06:13| prepared by the law department, and now we're saying potentially, potentially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3973)|
| 1:06:18| because I don't think I've heard the law director weigh in on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3978)|
| 1:06:22| but potentially that we can't even vote on the resolution that's appearing before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3982)|
| 1:06:28| This is concerning to me, I guess I'll say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3988)|
| 1:06:32| So where do we go from here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3992)|
| 1:06:34| Is the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3994)|
| 1:06:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3997)|
| 1:06:39| Go ahead, Mr. Armstrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=3999)|
| 1:06:45| Okay, where we are right now is you have the you wanted to put together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4005)|
| 1:06:52| and evaluate the future of the ethics committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4012)|
| 1:06:55| and that is totally within the power of Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4015)|
| 1:06:59| You have the right to evaluate the overall game plan and where it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4019)|
| 1:07:05| and you can remove and discharge all such members for good causes you deem fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4025)|
| 1:07:11| That's at your table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4031)|
| 1:07:13| I think where my colleague has come through on is that by the rules that we're playing under,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4033)|
| 1:07:20| you can select Mr. Cox or not Mr. Cox on the ratification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4040)|
| 1:07:25| The other two are more being spread for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4045)|
| 1:07:28| However, you can deal with the bigger issue of how do you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4048)|
| 1:07:32| I think Commissioner Hammond brought out a whole different light of how you might view this ethics committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4052)|
| 1:07:39| and I think you're at the point where I can't speak for commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4059)|
| 1:07:43| But anyway, you can evaluate how you want this committee to be in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4063)|
| 1:07:48| and do pretty much at large if you find just cause for a change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4068)|
| 1:07:52| or a change in the ethics committee itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4072)|
| 1:07:55| It may have influences on the way we work at the ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4075)|
| 1:07:59| But right now, the ratification was for your member, Mr. Cox, is really I think where it may not be that clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4079)|
| 1:08:06| but that's where the ratification came because he is your nominee, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4086)|
| 1:08:11| Was he not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4091)|
| 1:08:12| He's the sheriff's nominee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4092)|
| 1:08:14| He was appointed by the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4094)|
| 1:08:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4095)|
| 1:08:16| Then it's really to spread the record, and ratification is in error, truthfully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4096)|
| 1:08:20| I'm just sorry for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4100)|
| 1:08:21| I didn't notice that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4101)|
| 1:08:23| Privilege of point of order, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4103)|
| 1:08:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4105)|
| 1:08:26| Well, this is all sort of revolving around an interpretation by the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4106)|
| 1:08:31| So just let's just sort of open it up for questions, I think, for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4111)|
| 1:08:36| And I'm still going to go by the lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4116)|
| 1:08:38| Go ahead, Ms. Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4118)|
| 1:08:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4121)|
| 1:08:42| The ethics committee was created by the commission, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4122)|
| 1:08:45| What would it take for us to, what steps do we need to take to dissolve this current ethics committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4125)|
| 1:08:52| and then reconstitute it in a different manner with different, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4132)|
| 1:08:58| with like nine citizens appointed by, you know, two by the mayor, the rest by commission, whatever?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4138)|
| 1:09:06| What would we need to do to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4146)|
| 1:09:08| Because we may not have the authority, apparently, to ratify or not ratify these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4148)|
| 1:09:13| and I certainly don't understand why they're on the agenda if we don't have the ability to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4153)|
| 1:09:19| And in light of the fact that we're not able to do that, what did we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4159)|
| 1:09:23| what steps do we need to take to dissolve the current ethics committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4163)|
| 1:09:27| and then reconstitute it next month under a different set up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4167)|
| 1:09:32| Well, you have the power to establish this committee and dissolve this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4172)|
| 1:09:36| That's the legislative power that you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4176)|
| 1:09:40| You all can decide what terms that's under.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4180)|
| 1:09:42| You can debate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4182)|
| 1:09:43| You can discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4183)|
| 1:09:45| You can vote on whatever makeup you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4185)|
| 1:09:48| But it has to, but if you're dealing with just individual members like we're doing right now, you have to have just cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4188)|
| 1:09:54| So we can just ignore this number five today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4194)|
| 1:09:58| and then next month bring a resolution that dissolves the current ethics committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4198)|
| 1:10:03| and puts a different, or a different reconstituted ethics committee in its place, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4203)|
| 1:10:09| It's ordinance, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4209)|
| 1:10:13| You know, according to TCA 8-17-101, this was the Tennessee General Assembly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4213)|
| 1:10:20| that passed the Comprehensive Government Ethics Reform Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4220)|
| 1:10:23| And they're the ones that set up, it's just said among other requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4223)|
| 1:10:27| that local governments had to adopt ethical standards related, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4227)|
| 1:10:31| And then CTAS was the one who set up a model policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4231)|
| 1:10:39| And some of that model policy was that the sheriff, the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4239)|
| 1:10:44| the county commission put some of the county employees on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4244)|
| 1:10:48| Now, that's the policy that was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4248)|
| 1:10:50| Those are the, and Knox County adopted the CTAS as the model policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4250)|
| 1:10:56| With modifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4256)|
| 1:10:57| Yes, with modifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4257)|
| 1:10:58| So we can go back and do whatever we want with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4258)|
| 1:11:02| That's why I'm happy to just let this go this month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4262)|
| 1:11:05| and come back next month with the resolution that dissolves our current ethics committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4265)|
| 1:11:10| and puts in its place something that we all, apparently from what I'm hearing around the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4270)|
| 1:11:15| we would all like to see something different done with our ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4275)|
| 1:11:19| So that gives us a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4279)|
| 1:11:20| There are obviously no issues before the ethics committee anyway right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4280)|
| 1:11:26| I don't have a problem with leaving things as they are and coming back with something next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4286)|
| 1:11:31| Being on the prevailing side of the argument there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4291)|
| 1:11:33| I'd like to bring, make a motion to bring the argument back up in order to defer it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4293)|
| 1:11:37| without recommendation until next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4297)|
| 1:11:39| And Mr. Butte can, Mr. Armstrong can research it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4299)|
| 1:11:42| So that's my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4302)|
| 1:11:43| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4303)|
| 1:11:44| Prevailing member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4304)|
| 1:11:47| John, with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4307)|
| 1:11:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4308)|
| 1:11:49| Any other discussion to that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4309)|
| 1:11:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4311)|
| 1:11:52| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4312)|
| 1:11:53| Nothing on that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4313)|
| 1:11:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4314)|
| 1:11:55| You've still got your light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4315)|
| 1:11:56| Nothing to that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4316)|
| 1:11:57| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4317)|
| 1:11:58| I guess my question, you're bringing up both motions, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4318)|
| 1:12:01| Well, the first motion is to bring it back to the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4321)|
| 1:12:03| And the second, my preferred second motion would be to pass it without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4323)|
| 1:12:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4328)|
| 1:12:09| Because we ended up, I think we ended up actually voting on that second one, Captain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4329)|
| 1:12:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4334)|
| 1:12:15| So we're going to bring both those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4335)|
| 1:12:16| We're going to resend both of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4336)|
| 1:12:17| Both back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4337)|
| 1:12:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4338)|
| 1:12:19| Send them both out without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4339)|
| 1:12:20| Being on the prevailing side, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4340)|
| 1:12:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4342)|
| 1:12:23| So the motion to reconsider is before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4343)|
| 1:12:26| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4346)|
| 1:12:28| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4348)|
| 1:12:29| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4349)|
| 1:12:30| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4350)|
| 1:12:31| The motion to send without recommendation is before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4351)|
| 1:12:38| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4358)|
| 1:12:40| It's been made and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4360)|
| 1:12:43| Is there any discussion to that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4363)|
| 1:12:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4367)|
| 1:12:48| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4368)|
| 1:12:49| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4369)|
| 1:12:50| Go ahead, Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4370)|
| 1:12:52| Let me say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4372)|
| 1:12:53| We've raised several issues about where we think we may need to be looking in a different direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4373)|
| 1:13:01| And the term limit or the term, let me say this first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4381)|
| 1:13:07| The term is a two-year term, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4387)|
| 1:13:12| And two-year term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4392)|
| 1:13:15| It's a two-year term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4395)|
| 1:13:18| Three-year term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4398)|
| 1:13:20| Two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4400)|
| 1:13:25| The ordinance says three-year terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4405)|
| 1:13:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4408)|
| 1:13:30| Then how do we get to eight years with three-year terms?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4410)|
| 1:13:34| You get two terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4414)|
| 1:13:38| Anyway, I have heartburn with the ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4418)|
| 1:13:42| This will be something to be discussed, but I need to say it now because we can't discuss it anywhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4422)|
| 1:13:47| The term on the ethics committee, in my opinion, should be for two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4427)|
| 1:13:52| And the term limits are two terms, a total of four years, not a total of eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4432)|
| 1:13:58| So when we get into discussion of the makeup of the ethics committee, if there is to be a change in the makeup,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4438)|
| 1:14:07| the two-year term and the two-time term limit totals only four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4447)|
| 1:14:15| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4455)|
| 1:14:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4457)|
| 1:14:18| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4458)|
| 1:14:19| And well noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4459)|
| 1:14:20| I mean, especially with all of the extremely qualified people in that list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4460)|
| 1:14:27| that we had all the more reason to have shorter terms, more variety in that body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4467)|
| 1:14:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4473)|
| 1:14:34| We've got before us a motion of no recommendation to be sent on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4474)|
| 1:14:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4479)|
| 1:14:40| No recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4480)|
| 1:14:41| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4481)|
| 1:14:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4482)|
| 1:14:43| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4483)|
| 1:14:44| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4484)|
| 1:14:47| Mr. Smith wants to speak to the composition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4487)|
| 1:14:50| I just want us to be thinking about, Amy, a little bit what you talked about and Dr. Briggs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4490)|
| 1:14:54| and Mike a little bit what you mentioned over there, you know, want citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4494)|
| 1:14:57| And I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4497)|
| 1:14:58| But, you know, one thing that I'm fast forward, what if we had a retired elected official on there that knew something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4498)|
| 1:15:07| I'm thinking of a Leo Cooper or a Tank Strickland or somebody that has served in office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4507)|
| 1:15:15| I think that somebody like that would bring so much value to a committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4515)|
| 1:15:20| I'm just throwing out for you all to think about, but because with ethics committees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4520)|
| 1:15:25| and things really getting, they can be really tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4525)|
| 1:15:27| And if you've got a prior elected official that's not running for office again ever more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4527)|
| 1:15:33| that can give some insight to that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4533)|
| 1:15:35| And I think that those people to the volunteers would be greatly, would welcome that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4535)|
| 1:15:42| You know, I think Tank would do a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4542)|
| 1:15:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4549)|
| 1:15:50| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4550)|

| 1:16:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4564)|
| 1:16:05| Your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4565)|
| 1:16:06| I make a motion to stand without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4566)|
| 1:16:08| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4568)|
| 1:16:10| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4570)|
| 1:16:11| Hopefully we can go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4571)|
| 1:16:15| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4575)|
| 1:16:16| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4576)|
| 1:16:17| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4577)|
| 1:16:18| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4578)|
| 1:16:19| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4579)|
| 1:16:25| On page three, item 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4585)|
| 1:16:33| Approving the necessary right-of-way acquisitions for the Bob Gray Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4593)|
| 1:16:37| and Mabey Hood Road intersection improvements, nine tracks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4597)|
| 1:16:40| and the Bob Gray Road and Bob Kirby Road intersection improvements, nine tracks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4600)|
| 1:16:44| as shown on the county right-of-way plans resolution 408.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4604)|
| 1:16:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4609)|
| 1:16:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4610)|
| 1:16:51| Could I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4611)|
| 1:16:52| Motion to defer at the watch request for until or, I'm sorry, motion to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4612)|
| 1:16:57| Stand without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4617)|
| 1:16:59| Until next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4619)|
| 1:17:00| I mean, there's still some opposition to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4620)|
| 1:17:03| And Dwight's reasoning for that is to have a meeting with the opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4623)|
| 1:17:07| But I hope that we can move this forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4627)|
| 1:17:11| It's a very dangerous road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4631)|
| 1:17:12| And Dwight will explain the engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4632)|
| 1:17:14| But as it comes to us next week, I'd like for you guys to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4634)|
| 1:17:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4638)|
| 1:17:19| We've got a motion without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4639)|
| 1:17:20| I hear a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4640)|
| 1:17:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4641)|
| 1:17:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4642)|
| 1:17:23| Go ahead, Dwight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4643)|
| 1:17:24| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4644)|
| 1:17:26| Jim Snowden is going to pass out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4646)|
| 1:17:27| Name and address there, Dwight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4647)|
| 1:17:28| 708-205 West Baxter Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4648)|
| 1:17:31| Mr. Snowden is going to pass out a summary that's been prepared by our consulting engineers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4651)|
| 1:17:35| and the project from Cannon & Cannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4655)|
| 1:17:38| And we would ask that commission review this carefully over the week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4658)|
| 1:17:42| and think of any questions that you might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4662)|
| 1:17:44| And the folks from Cannon & Cannon will be here along with our staff next week to answer any questions that you may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4664)|
| 1:17:51| Again, we are asking that this be sent without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4671)|
| 1:17:55| This originally, the genesis of it, if you will, in late 2011,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4675)|
| 1:18:01| we did have two public meetings in the community to discuss the possibility of roundabouts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4681)|
| 1:18:06| as a solution to crash events on Bob Gray Road at these two intersections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4686)|
| 1:18:12| We subsequently had a meeting in the mayor's office after this was originally placed on the commission agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4692)|
| 1:18:19| It was postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4699)|
| 1:18:20| We had a meeting in the mayor's office to discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4700)|
| 1:18:23| I asked Cannon & Cannon to go back through and look at a number of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4703)|
| 1:18:27| There's five options total that are listed in the material you have and evaluate those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4707)|
| 1:18:32| and see what might be the best solution to improve the crash situation at these two intersections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4712)|
| 1:18:40| I should, by the way, take note there are a couple of folks from the community who are opposed to these who are here today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4720)|
| 1:18:47| in case they want to be recognized and speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4727)|
| 1:18:50| We try to just limit our discussion today as much as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4730)|
| 1:18:53| and give commission a chance to review these materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4733)|
| 1:18:56| Also, before we had an extensive discussion, we wanted to have our meeting with the folks from the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4736)|
| 1:19:01| that we previously met with in the mayor's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4741)|
| 1:19:04| and then bring the discussion back before the body next week, answer any specific questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4744)|
| 1:19:10| Like Commissioner Anders, we think that we have done all due diligence on this matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4750)|
| 1:19:15| and we are prepared to make a recommendation to the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4755)|
| 1:19:19| But given that we hadn't had a chance to meet with the citizens, we wanted to defer that until next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4759)|
| 1:19:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4764)|
| 1:19:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4765)|
| 1:19:26| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4766)|
| 1:19:27| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4767)|
| 1:19:29| You named a date that we started on this or you all started on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4769)|
| 1:19:34| There was a public meeting at, I believe, Cedar Wolf Library?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4774)|
| 1:19:40| Two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4780)|
| 1:19:41| Two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4781)|
| 1:19:43| And I need to say that Commissioner Norman and I were both in attendance at one of those meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4783)|
| 1:19:50| and I didn't know that he would be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4790)|
| 1:19:52| He stood in one corner and I stood in the other and I only listened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4792)|
| 1:19:59| Is there any significant change in any of this work as compared to the way it was presented a year and a half ago?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4799)|
| 1:20:10| I think what I'd characterize that best, Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4810)|
| 1:20:12| by saying we just really asked Kennan & Kennan to take a step back and once again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4812)|
| 1:20:17| without prejudice or any kind of preconceived notion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4817)|
| 1:20:20| look at all the options that might be available to us to improve the circumstances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4820)|
| 1:20:26| and see what the best science of the day and what the data tells us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4826)|
| 1:20:31| And that's what they've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4831)|
| 1:20:33| They get paid regardless of the recommendations they make to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4833)|
| 1:20:36| So they don't have any vested interest in one solution over another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4836)|
| 1:20:39| Their fees aren't based on whether they recommend an intersection or roundabouts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4839)|
| 1:20:43| or no action or a traffic signal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4843)|
| 1:20:45| And at the end of the day, after really exhaustive analysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4845)|
| 1:20:49| most of the recommendations have not changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4849)|
| 1:20:51| We continue to think this is the best solution for both of these intersections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4851)|
| 1:20:57| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4857)|
| 1:20:58| Thank you, Mr. Mendevate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4858)|
| 1:21:00| The gentlemen that have come, I think Mr. LaForce, Mr. Shaw, either one of you or both would like to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4860)|
| 1:21:05| Come forward, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4865)|
| 1:21:08| And give your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4868)|
| 1:21:11| Yes, Norman Shaw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4871)|
| 1:21:12| I live at 1120 Winding Way Drive in Knoxville, which is subdivision of Bob Gray Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4872)|
| 1:21:19| I was at the June 25th meeting and I did speak at that time with two other residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4879)|
| 1:21:26| The June 25th meeting is the one where Mayor Burchett asked that it be taken off the agenda for the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4886)|
| 1:21:35| we citizens, to meet with the county staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4895)|
| 1:21:38| And we were very pleased with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4898)|
| 1:21:40| We had some concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4900)|
| 1:21:41| We had some alternate recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4901)|
| 1:21:43| And we did meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4903)|
| 1:21:46| The June 25th was the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4906)|
| 1:21:48| It was taken off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4908)|
| 1:21:49| We met July the 12th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4909)|
| 1:21:51| I thought I had a good meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4911)|
| 1:21:52| We met in the mayor's conference room with Mr. Mendevate and Jim Snowden and Dean Rice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4912)|
| 1:22:00| I thought we had a good meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4920)|
| 1:22:01| We shared our concerns and alternative proposals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4921)|
| 1:22:04| And this, of course, was three months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4924)|
| 1:22:08| And what we were told is that they would look at this and reexamine it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4928)|
| 1:22:12| And also, they wanted to have a new traffic count, new traffic survey at these intersections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4932)|
| 1:22:22| And it was suggested to do that after school starts so we get an accurate count because the intersections aren't really that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4942)|
| 1:22:27| congested during the summertime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4947)|
| 1:22:30| So that was done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4950)|
| 1:22:32| And we were told that when that was finished, we'd get back together and have a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4952)|
| 1:22:36| And there would be no official action taken at all on anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4956)|
| 1:22:39| So that was three months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4959)|
| 1:22:41| So we've been waiting for this meeting to take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4961)|
| 1:22:45| And let me just say this, that we are not against roundabouts per se.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4965)|
| 1:22:51| Roundabouts do serve a good function in certain circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4971)|
| 1:22:54| We are against roundabouts on Bob Gray Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4974)|
| 1:22:57| And I'll give you three quick reasons why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4977)|
| 1:23:00| The most roundabouts that I've seen, and I did a tour myself Sunday and visited the one in Farragut from the Kroger store| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4980)|
| 1:23:06| and the one at Concord and North Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4986)|
| 1:23:09| And I went down where the new one is proposed at Choteau Road coming into North Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4989)|
| 1:23:14| And I got to feel what they look like again and what they're about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=4994)|
| 1:23:20| And everything, the research that's been done and that I've learned about and expressed to me is that this is always done on level ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5000)|
| 1:23:27| Flat land where the roundabouts work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5007)|
| 1:23:29| Bob Gray is not a flat road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5009)|
| 1:23:32| It runs along the top of a ridge, the length of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5012)|
| 1:23:36| And sometimes it's flat and other times it's like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5016)|
| 1:23:39| And these two intersections are at places where the crossing roads come at an angle pretty much like this, 45-degree angle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5019)|
| 1:23:47| So there's concern there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5027)|
| 1:23:48| It's all been taken into consideration to build roundabouts on a ridge, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5028)|
| 1:23:56| And also there's going to be a tight fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5036)|
| 1:23:59| If they do get those in there, and I've seen the drawings and seen the stakes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5039)|
| 1:24:03| there's basically a house out of each four corners of each intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5043)|
| 1:24:08| There's basically a house close to that corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5048)|
| 1:24:11| Three out of four of those corners have houses that are close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5051)|
| 1:24:14| So when this is finished, you're going to have a roundabout coming to within a few feet of several of these homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5054)|
| 1:24:20| which will probably make them unsellable and be worthless for the people that live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5060)|
| 1:24:26| So that's concern of that tight fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5066)|
| 1:24:29| And the other is the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5069)|
| 1:24:32| What in front of you is an estimate for a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5072)|
| 1:24:37| I do know as an established fact that it costs $900,000 to build the roundabout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5077)|
| 1:24:42| at the intersection of Concord Road and North Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5082)|
| 1:24:46| So they did that for $900,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5086)|
| 1:24:48| I'm not sure how they can do two within three-quarters of a mile of each other for a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5088)|
| 1:24:54| That's $500,000 each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5094)|
| 1:24:56| So there's a concern there about serious overruns, especially when you're dealing with the sloped land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5096)|
| 1:25:01| So I want to mention that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5101)|
| 1:25:04| But getting back to our meeting, we had the one meeting three months ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5104)|
| 1:25:07| and they did put out the cables to count the cars at the intersections in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5107)|
| 1:25:13| And then I was told that they'd probably finish that up and review it at the end of September and get back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5113)|
| 1:25:19| Well, September passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5119)|
| 1:25:20| I didn't hear anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5120)|
| 1:25:21| And then the two weeks of October passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5121)|
| 1:25:24| Still nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5124)|
| 1:25:25| I'm getting a little concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5125)|
| 1:25:26| But I do get an e-mail last Friday from Jim Snowden at 4.44 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5126)|
| 1:25:33| end of the workday that says, we're going to have a meeting this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5133)|
| 1:25:38| We'd like to finally get back with you three months later and have a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5138)|
| 1:25:41| But we've put this on into the official process because that's why it's in front of you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5141)|
| 1:25:48| So I thought that wasn't fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5148)|
| 1:25:49| They're saying we're going to have to be no official action until we had at least a second meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5149)|
| 1:25:54| Then I get the e-mail Friday that says, we're going to have a meeting this week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5154)|
| 1:25:58| and then we've only got a week to do it and we've got a lot of people to get together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5158)|
| 1:26:01| But we were going to go ahead and take official action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5161)|
| 1:26:04| That's why it's in front of you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5164)|
| 1:26:05| So it was taken off the agenda in June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5165)|
| 1:26:07| And now it's back in front of you for possible putting it on the agenda for this coming Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5167)|
| 1:26:13| So my request is that this be postponed one more month, at least, I think, out of fairness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5173)|
| 1:26:21| out of good faith, to let us meet with the staff without having the commission meeting right at our backs this following Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5181)|
| 1:26:29| We're crammed in between the workshop and the commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5189)|
| 1:26:34| And we probably won't be able to meet until Thursday or Friday anyway because you've got to get a lot of people together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5194)|
| 1:26:37| So it's really put us in a box, and I don't think it's fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5197)|
| 1:26:40| I think my recommendation, my suggestion, is that this be postponed one more month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5200)|
| 1:26:46| and take care of this vote in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5206)|
| 1:26:50| And plus the fact, I know I'm out of time, but I remember Mr. Hammond suggested at the June meeting that the several of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5210)|
| 1:26:57| council members attend or go visit these sites to really see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5217)|
| 1:27:01| You've really got to see it to understand what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5221)|
| 1:27:03| And that was never done in this three-month period either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5223)|
| 1:27:05| And I really suggest that for the different commissioners involved, like Mr. Norman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5225)|
| 1:27:11| and Mr. Anders and, of course, the two at large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5231)|
| 1:27:14| I think that never was done either, and I really suggest that should be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5234)|
| 1:27:18| So I would give us time if you postpone this until the November commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5238)|
| 1:27:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5243)|
| 1:27:24| Thank you, Mr. Shaw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5244)|
| 1:27:25| And that may be taken up again on Monday, as we said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5245)|
| 1:27:27| Go ahead, Mr. LaForce, and name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5247)|
| 1:27:31| Hank LaForce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5251)|
| 1:27:32| I'm at 1137 Greatwood Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5252)|
| 1:27:34| I own a property that's most proximal on the southwest corner of the Bob Gray, Bob Kirby intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5254)|
| 1:27:39| So I appreciate just a second so that I can stand up and vocalize what concerns me about building a roundabout there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5259)|
| 1:27:47| I'm not a traffic engineer, obviously, but I have owned that property for 26 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5267)|
| 1:27:51| And I think I have as practical a knowledge of that intersection, that little strip of road, as anyone here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5271)|
| 1:27:58| Putting a roundabout there does not address the whole problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5278)|
| 1:28:01| Sure, it's a dangerous intersection, dangerous road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5281)|
| 1:28:03| There's been numerous accidents at the intersection over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5283)|
| 1:28:05| But there's also been numerous accidents approaching the intersection that never make it to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5285)|
| 1:28:10| You're coming downhill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5290)|
| 1:28:11| Primarily, the danger is when you're traveling east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5291)|
| 1:28:13| You're coming down Bob Gray Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5293)|
| 1:28:15| You're coming around downhill, around a corner on a narrow two-lane road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5295)|
| 1:28:18| and you don't have visibility at the intersection until you're just within a few hundred yards of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5298)|
| 1:28:22| Coming around that corner, if you're going too fast, which is the bottom line to all of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5302)|
| 1:28:27| and if you don't negotiate that corner, your wheel goes off the edge, you go off the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5307)|
| 1:28:32| One of the more serious accidents happened a couple of years ago in the backyard of that condo where they went off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5312)|
| 1:28:37| The bushes are still knocked out where that happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5317)|
| 1:28:39| Putting a roundabout there would affect that zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5319)|
| 1:28:43| What's most disappointing is that we're jumping to this big conclusion, this million-dollar answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5323)|
| 1:28:48| without ever attempting any other traffic calming or speed reducing measures at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5328)|
| 1:28:56| In all those years, I've never seen us do anything other than put another sign up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5336)|
| 1:28:59| When I talk and I have a couple of times with the engineers about the project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5339)|
| 1:29:03| they're saying there's nothing, no data to support doing anything but a roundabout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5343)|
| 1:29:08| I just think we're jumping to a conclusion before we do anything else first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5348)|
| 1:29:12| No flashing lights, no painted street, no, you know, grading of the road, no reflective markers, anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5352)|
| 1:29:20| Nothing will be attempted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5360)|
| 1:29:21| We've got to do the roundabout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5361)|
| 1:29:23| And it just concerns me, one, financially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5363)|
| 1:29:25| I don't think we're addressing the curve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5365)|
| 1:29:27| And, you know, when I ask, well, how will we warn people that the roundabout is at the bottom of the curve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5367)|
| 1:29:32| I'm told, well, we're going to put up signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5372)|
| 1:29:35| So it just seems like we're quite honestly on an agenda to find roundabout spots in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5375)|
| 1:29:41| So I would hope that we would take a rational approach to, can we attempt something else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5381)|
| 1:29:46| much more cost effective before we jump into this very disruptive, very expensive project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5386)|
| 1:29:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5391)|
| 1:29:52| Thank you, Mr. LaForse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5392)|
| 1:29:53| We'll get a couple of lights on Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5393)|
| 1:29:57| Mr. Chairman, I lived a number of years there in the Gulfwood area, Fox-Lonas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5397)|
| 1:30:02| And I'm very familiar with that intersection and drove down there and have seen it since we had this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5402)|
| 1:30:08| So I have been there, have seen it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5408)|
| 1:30:10| and driven by through it and so forth and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5410)|
| 1:30:13| So I have seen that visual inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5413)|
| 1:30:15| I'm not against delaying 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5415)|
| 1:30:18| I mean, this has been going on for several months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5418)|
| 1:30:20| And I feel like that the people need an opportunity to give some type of input here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5420)|
| 1:30:24| So when we meet on it on Monday, I will not be opposed personally to giving another 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5424)|
| 1:30:29| so that they can have adequate time to meet with the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5429)|
| 1:30:31| It may be that we come back and I know they've spent a lot of time and effort on this, which I appreciate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5431)|
| 1:30:36| But given the comments from the citizens, we waited this long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5436)|
| 1:30:40| I think we can wait another 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5440)|
| 1:30:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5442)|
| 1:30:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5443)|
| 1:30:44| Mr. McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5444)|
| 1:30:45| Yeah, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5445)|
| 1:30:46| And, Dwight, if you could, you know, another good point the first gentleman made was about the slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5446)|
| 1:30:52| So could you give us maybe a contour map Monday of this area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5452)|
| 1:30:56| Do you have that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5456)|
| 1:30:57| I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5457)|
| 1:30:58| I can also provide you information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5458)|
| 1:30:59| Kennan and Cannon will actually make a full presentation regarding topography| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5459)|
| 1:31:05| and all the alternatives that we've considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5465)|
| 1:31:07| And they will address fairly extensively the issues of concern over the sag in the intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5467)|
| 1:31:16| Actually, it's probably a preferred configuration for roundabouts and not a problematic one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5476)|
| 1:31:21| And we'll speak to that on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5481)|
| 1:31:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5482)|
| 1:31:23| Because I'm ashamed to agree with Commissioner Hammond on 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5483)|
| 1:31:27| It's not a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5487)|
| 1:31:28| And if it's a can Cannon and Cannon come at lunch?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5488)|
| 1:31:31| Do we have it in the lunch agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5491)|
| 1:31:33| Is it full or do you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5493)|
| 1:31:33| No, they could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5493)|
| 1:31:35| Could you make that known to them, Dwight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5495)|
| 1:31:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5498)|
| 1:31:39| And come to our lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5499)|
| 1:31:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5500)|
| 1:31:41| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5501)|
| 1:31:42| Motions to ascend without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5502)|
| 1:31:45| We'll take that up again on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5505)|
| 1:31:47| So it may go on to the 30-day deferral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5507)|
| 1:31:49| This doesn't do anything to you all, your need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5509)|
| 1:31:54| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5514)|
| 1:31:55| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5515)|
| 1:31:56| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5516)|
| 1:31:57| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5517)|
| 1:31:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5518)|
| 1:32:02| Item number 19, approving a lease agreement in the amount of $650 per month with John K.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5522)|
| 1:32:10| Kinsey and the Carter Convenience Center, Resolution 409.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5530)|
| 1:32:16| Your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5536)|
| 1:32:18| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5538)|
| 1:32:19| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5539)|
| 1:32:20| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5540)|
| 1:32:22| I've been out of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5542)|
| 1:32:23| Is there a term on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5543)|
| 1:32:26| Is it a year, two years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5546)|
| 1:32:28| Let Tom Salter speak to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5548)|
| 1:32:30| The part I remember is it's a $50 a month increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5550)|
| 1:32:32| But I'm sorry, Commissioner, I don't recall the term of the lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5552)|
| 1:32:36| Tom, give your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5556)|
| 1:32:39| Tom Salter, 205 West Baxter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5559)|
| 1:32:42| Commissioner, it is for one year with four additional years option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5562)|
| 1:32:47| And that is specifically we discussed if we want to relocate that center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5567)|
| 1:32:53| or build a permanent center there, we're not locked into something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5573)|
| 1:32:56| It's just year to year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5576)|
| 1:32:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5578)|
| 1:32:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5579)|
| 1:33:00| That answers my question because my comment follows that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5580)|
| 1:33:02| As soon as there's a convenience center down the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5582)|
| 1:33:08| that leaves Carter as the convenience center that needs the improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5588)|
| 1:33:13| And we're not locked into a multi-year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5593)|
| 1:33:15| It's year to year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5595)|
| 1:33:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5596)|
| 1:33:17| You hear that, Dwight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5597)|
| 1:33:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5599)|
| 1:33:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5601)|
| 1:33:23| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5603)|
| 1:33:24| Mr. Salter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5604)|
| 1:33:25| Just want to comment that the house, you've got it looking really sharp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5605)|
| 1:33:29| You guys do a good job with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5609)|
| 1:33:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5611)|
| 1:33:32| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5612)|
| 1:33:34| That was kind of my question as well, why I asked to have it pulled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5614)|
| 1:33:40| And that's, you know, I'm not a Carter resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5620)|
| 1:33:44| But if you've ever gone there, it's pretty tough to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5624)|
| 1:33:47| You've got to scratch your head and circle around a few times before you can actually hit it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5627)|
| 1:33:52| You've got to kind of catch it at the corner of your eye and then cross a couple of lanes of traffic and get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5632)|
| 1:33:58| But why don't we buy land?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5638)|
| 1:34:03| I mean, we've got plenty of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5643)|
| 1:34:04| And Carter has a bunch of it out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5644)|
| 1:34:06| It's pretty rural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5646)|
| 1:34:09| I just wonder why we're entering in these lease agreements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5649)|
| 1:34:13| And, you know, I'm sure this has been a long-term lease agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5653)|
| 1:34:18| I'm sure it's at least 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5658)|
| 1:34:20| You know, I'm sure it's good for Mr. Chastney, but it seemed like we would do something a little different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5660)|
| 1:34:26| Well, let me just say it's next on the radar screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5666)|
| 1:34:29| We are funded, commission included and the mayor included money in the capital plan for a new Carnes Convenience Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5669)|
| 1:34:36| Of the eight centers, Carnes and Carter were the only two in which the county does not own the real property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5676)|
| 1:34:42| We went with Carnes first, Commissioner, because the traffic issues on Oak Ridge Highway are pretty severe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5682)|
| 1:34:46| versus Carter is absolutely a small and underperforming center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5686)|
| 1:34:51| It's difficult to locate, and there's some constraints on what we can do there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5691)|
| 1:34:55| But we don't actually have the traffic safety issues that we're concerned about at the Carnes Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5695)|
| 1:35:00| So it will be on our list as soon as we get the Carnes Center sited and underway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5700)|
| 1:35:08| Budgetarily, we'll be back to the body at some point with the mayor's approval, I think, to find a site for a new Carter Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5708)|
| 1:35:15| But also just mention that they're actually not the easiest thing in the world to site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5715)|
| 1:35:21| Not everybody is enthusiastic about having them as a neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5721)|
| 1:35:24| That's a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5724)|
| 1:35:25| And that's my --I agree with Carnes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5725)|
| 1:35:27| I mean, that place was a zoo to get in and out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5727)|
| 1:35:30| So, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5730)|
| 1:35:31| My general concern is, you know, the county renting properties like that when we should probably own those properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5731)|
| 1:35:39| for reasons, you know, environmental reasons and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5739)|
| 1:35:43| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5743)|
| 1:35:44| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5744)|
| 1:35:45| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5745)|
| 1:35:46| Thank you, Commissioner McKenzie, for bringing that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5746)|
| 1:35:49| I visited the Carnes Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5749)|
| 1:35:51| And if you place them side-by-side, you get run over at Carnes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5751)|
| 1:35:56| At least you can get off and on the road or make your way into the site at Carter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5756)|
| 1:36:01| But it does need to be upgraded to be on the same par as Halls or Gibbs or the other four or five centers as soon as Carnes is complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5761)|
| 1:36:12| And this is not a --there's a lot of money involved here, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5772)|
| 1:36:18| The $650 a month just gets us by for another year or into the next budget cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5778)|
| 1:36:24| And we can decide then where best to spend our money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5784)|
| 1:36:29| And I do need to say one other thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5789)|
| 1:36:33| This is going back to the previous item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5793)|
| 1:36:35| I visited the Carnes Center, the convenience center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5795)|
| 1:36:39| I've also been to these locations where we're talking about roundabouts, and I've seen them also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5799)|
| 1:36:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5808)|
| 1:36:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5809)|
| 1:36:50| We have a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5810)|
| 1:36:51| Thank you, Mr. Salter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5811)|
| 1:36:52| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5812)|
| 1:36:53| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5813)|
| 1:36:54| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5814)|
| 1:36:55| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5815)|
| 1:36:56| Item number 21, approving a defined services contract with Knoxville Convention and Visitors Bureau,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5816)|
| 1:37:02| doing business as visit Knoxville for destination marketing and event management services, Resolution 801.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5822)|
| 1:37:09| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5829)|
| 1:37:10| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5830)|
| 1:37:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5831)|
| 1:37:12| And we've got some of the folks here, Ms. Bumpus and entourage is here to talk if we need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5832)|
| 1:37:19| And Mr. Hammond's got a question, I think, for as regards to contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5839)|
| 1:37:24| Go ahead, Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5844)|
| 1:37:25| I don't really have a question on the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5845)|
| 1:37:26| I guess my question is more about moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5846)|
| 1:37:29| I would like for us to have a reporting procedure, perhaps quarterly or so forth, on exactly how things are going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5849)|
| 1:37:39| the progress that you've been made and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5859)|
| 1:37:41| And the reason that I bring this up is that I'm very involved in Sevier County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5861)|
| 1:37:46| and they have a very good reporting procedure there on a monthly basis on hotel occupancy, their amusements, et cetera, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5866)|
| 1:37:57| I'm wondering, and, again, I don't want to rehash old things, Ms. Bumpus, but, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5877)|
| 1:38:03| when we're told that if our name is mentioned in the Boston newspaper, we consider that a big deal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5883)|
| 1:38:09| I think that, you know, that's one way of looking at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5889)|
| 1:38:11| But I think another way of looking at it is how are we doing in terms of filling up the hotels here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5891)|
| 1:38:15| What kind of reporting procedures do we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5895)|
| 1:38:18| What is the plan for 2012 and 2013?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5898)|
| 1:38:22| I don't think any of us are pleased with the fact that Hamilton County now is supposedly beating us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5902)|
| 1:38:27| So I, you know, this is a new day, and I'm in favor of this, want to vote in favor of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5907)|
| 1:38:33| but I'm wondering how we can work together to better understand what your organization is doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5913)|
| 1:38:38| in terms of bringing tourism here and how we can get this reporting process for hotel-motel tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5918)|
| 1:38:44| hotel occupancy, and get some figures on a regular basis so that we know where we are moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5924)|
| 1:38:52| Well, I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5932)|
| 1:38:53| Kim, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5933)|
| 1:38:54| Name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5934)|
| 1:38:55| Kim Bumpus, 301 Southgate Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5935)|
| 1:38:57| And, Mr. Hammond, I believe I agree with you completely, and we have actually, in the contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5937)|
| 1:39:03| identified some much more aggressive metrics in moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5943)|
| 1:39:07| And one of the things that we'll be doing that we can show the community, because I think the one thing Visit Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5947)|
| 1:39:12| wants to focus on is community involvement and transparency and education as it relates to tourism,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5952)|
| 1:39:19| because that is one of the things that was missing from the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5959)|
| 1:39:22| And like you said, Hamilton County has leaped over us only by $9 million in visitor spending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5962)|
| 1:39:27| So we're going to make that up pretty quickly and regain our lead on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5967)|
| 1:39:32| But with that in mind, we have the reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5972)|
| 1:39:35| So we're going to be putting them together in a more user-friendly fashion so that the community can understand them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5975)|
| 1:39:42| And that will be communicated in any way anybody wants to see it, through dashboards, through raw data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5982)|
| 1:39:48| however they want to see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5988)|
| 1:39:49| But we also have metrics in the contract, too, that the county will be looking at quarterly and annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5989)|
| 1:39:55| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5995)|
| 1:39:59| If you hold 1,000 North Central, that's exactly correct what you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=5999)|
| 1:40:03| The reporting moving forward is going to be much more stringent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6003)|
| 1:40:08| It's going to be measurable and quantifiable, and it's going to hold them accountable on a quarterly basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6008)|
| 1:40:14| So will we be getting those reports on a quarterly basis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6014)|
| 1:40:17| Yes, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6017)|
| 1:40:18| And the difference between this contract, I guess the biggest difference is this is a pay-for-performance contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6018)|
| 1:40:24| versus just a monthly disbursement of funds where we will look at this information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6024)|
| 1:40:30| They have a set of goals to meet every quarter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6030)|
| 1:40:32| And if they meet those goals, then we'll release the dollars to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6032)|
| 1:40:36| Otherwise, we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6036)|
| 1:40:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6038)|
| 1:40:39| Mr. Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6039)|
| 1:40:40| Hugh, I just want to kind of talk a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6040)|
| 1:40:44| I followed the process quite a bit with Hugh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6044)|
| 1:40:47| Talk about, I guess, the good thing about the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6047)|
| 1:40:51| Once the contract was, they were accepted as a winning bid, the contract process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6051)|
| 1:40:57| they opened up to doing whatever the county asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6057)|
| 1:40:59| And I think that shows a lot of professionalism on their part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6059)|
| 1:41:04| Very easy to work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6064)|
| 1:41:05| They understood the situation that we were in as well as the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6065)|
| 1:41:10| And they come to the table ready to work with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6070)|
| 1:41:18| Mr. Owenby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6078)|
| 1:41:18| Yeah, I want to echo what Commissioner Hammond said and Commissioner Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6078)|
| 1:41:24| You've, over the last, I guess, couple of weeks, I've contacted you several times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6084)|
| 1:41:31| and you've answered my questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6091)|
| 1:41:33| And I feel like that this process was a little bit more open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6093)|
| 1:41:39| The public still has a little heartburn over a few months back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6099)|
| 1:41:44| So, I guess it's going to be proof to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6104)|
| 1:41:50| But I see that there's a lot of things in the contract that basically says, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6110)|
| 1:41:55| that's going to, I think, ease a lot of that with the public over the course of the duration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6115)|
| 1:42:02| of this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6122)|
| 1:42:03| So, I want to commend you all for the hard work you've done on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6123)|
| 1:42:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6127)|
| 1:42:10| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6130)|
| 1:42:13| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6133)|
| 1:42:15| I don't want to sound like I'm echoing everybody else's comments, but through some of the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6135)|
| 1:42:25| organizations and boards and so forth that I work with, people don't realize how broad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6145)|
| 1:42:33| their scope is in the community, as far as Visit Knoxville is concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6153)|
| 1:42:39| How many different organizations that they are helping and behind in promotion and all this kind of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6159)|
| 1:42:45| So, these quarterly reports, Kim, I think, will be something that will help you as well as us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6165)|
| 1:42:51| because it is going to let the community know what is going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6171)|
| 1:42:54| And I personally know from dealing with you guys what some of the things you're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6174)|
| 1:42:59| but I don't think a lot of other people do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6179)|
| 1:43:04| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6184)|
| 1:43:05| We have a motion before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6185)|
| 1:43:06| Thank you, Hugh, Kim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6186)|
| 1:43:09| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6189)|
| 1:43:10| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6190)|
| 1:43:11| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6191)|
| 1:43:12| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6192)|
| 1:43:13| One, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6193)|
| 1:43:14| One, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6194)|
| 1:43:19| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6199)|
| 1:43:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6204)|
| 1:43:25| So, the motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6205)|
| 1:43:30| Ten to one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6210)|
| 1:43:31| Next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6211)|
| 1:43:33| On page four, item number 23.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6213)|
| 1:43:37| This is a resolution releasing and reallocating to the State of Tennessee the county's qualified energy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6217)|
| 1:43:44| conservation bond formula allocated in the authority in the amount of $2,501,003 allocated to Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6224)|
| 1:43:53| pursuant to the provisions of the Energy Improvement and Extension Act of 2008,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6233)|
| 1:43:59| Division B of the Public Law, 110-343, as amended, Resolution 803.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6239)|
| 1:44:08| Do you have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6248)|
| 1:44:11| Can they tell us what this is, sort of, Chris or Hugh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6251)|
| 1:44:15| There probably needs to be a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6255)|
| 1:44:17| I'm so moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6257)|
| 1:44:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6258)|
| 1:44:19| In a second, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6259)|
| 1:44:21| Okay, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6261)|
| 1:44:22| Go ahead, Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6262)|
| 1:44:25| Basically, what this is, is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6265)|
| 1:44:26| Name and address, Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6266)|
| 1:44:28| 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6268)|
| 1:44:30| This is simply bonds that we could give from the state for an energy savings type of a program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6270)|
| 1:44:39| But we could not use the bonds in any way where we could save any money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6279)|
| 1:44:46| And we offered it to the schools, and they were the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6286)|
| 1:44:48| They could not they did not have any projects where we could save any money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6288)|
| 1:44:52| And the state requires us to do this resolution, giving the money back to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6292)|
| 1:44:57| So it's basically like a new process to give it back to the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6297)|
| 1:45:02| Bonds as in borrowing money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6302)|
| 1:45:05| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6305)|
| 1:45:06| So you don't need to borrow the money because there's no project you can effectively use it on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6306)|
| 1:45:10| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6310)|
| 1:45:11| Just going back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6311)|
| 1:45:12| Was it a great deal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6312)|
| 1:45:13| I mean, super cheap interest or about what you could borrow it anyway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6313)|
| 1:45:19| Yeah, it's close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6319)|
| 1:45:20| I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6320)|
| 1:45:21| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6321)|
| 1:45:24| Commissioner Shouse, when you accept those bonds, they come with certain reporting requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6324)|
| 1:45:30| Like this one comes with Davis-Bacon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6330)|
| 1:45:33| If you incorporate Davis-Bacon reporting into a contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6333)|

| 1:45:43| So with how cheap money is today, it really the numbers don't work out where we could save any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6343)|
| 1:45:51| Was the money borrowed by the state or by us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6351)|
| 1:45:53| I mean, as far as the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6353)|

| 1:46:04| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6364)|
| 1:46:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6365)|

| 1:47:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6442)|
| 1:47:23| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6443)|
| 1:47:24| Mr. Hammond, I saw your light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6444)|
| 1:47:27| Ms. Broyles, do you want to speak to it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6447)|
| 1:47:29| You're the maker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6449)|
| 1:47:32| Ms. Broyles, do you want to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6452)|
| 1:47:35| Mike, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6455)|
| 1:47:37| I was just going to say Mike Brown and I met on this last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6457)|
| 1:47:42| And a couple of reasons we wanted to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6462)|
| 1:47:46| When I started looking back at the report that we accepted two and a half years ago or a couple of years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6466)|
| 1:47:57| there were several recommendations that we adopted but that we didn't do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6477)|
| 1:48:04| One of them was that county vehicles would be parked over at the Coliseum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6484)|
| 1:48:10| That's apparently not being done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6490)|
| 1:48:13| That the parking spaces around the old courthouse would become handicapped spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6493)|
| 1:48:22| And that didn't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6502)|
| 1:48:23| And it turns out for a very good reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6503)|
| 1:48:25| It turns out when we started looking at those spaces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6505)|
| 1:48:28| it turned out that there could not be a more dangerous place for a person with a disability to park than in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6508)|
| 1:48:35| particular spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6515)|
| 1:48:36| So that's good that that didn't get followed through on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6516)|
| 1:48:38| And also this committee was supposed to be meeting on a yearly basis to keep itself updated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6518)|
| 1:48:43| and see how all this was being done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6523)|
| 1:48:45| And the committee has not done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6525)|
| 1:48:47| So the only thing that we did do that we did implement was increasing the parking rate for county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6527)|
| 1:48:54| and city employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6534)|
| 1:48:56| It's been, as we all know, quite a while since our employees have received a raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6536)|
| 1:49:03| They did get a three percent bump back in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6543)|
| 1:49:08| Which did actually very little for most of them at best for the ones who are the most in need of help right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6548)|
| 1:49:19| It provided maybe one more trip to the grocery store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6559)|
| 1:49:23| So I don't want anyone to be under the illusion that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6563)|
| 1:49:26| our employees are suddenly making a lot more money because of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6566)|
| 1:49:30| The ones who desperately need it the most are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6570)|
| 1:49:33| But we have raised their rates during this time that they've not received any raises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6573)|
| 1:49:37| We have increased the rates that they're paying on their health insurance premium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6577)|
| 1:49:43| And we have increased their parking already substantially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6583)|
| 1:49:48| I understand that the desire was that our employees pay no less than half of the market rate for downtown parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6588)|
| 1:49:58| And I would be a little more agreeable to that if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6598)|
| 1:50:01| and what I hear is that people who work downtown in these other buildings pay significantly more in parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6601)|
| 1:50:09| From the people I've talked to, and this is by no means a scientific study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6609)|
| 1:50:12| it's one of the things I'd like for this committee to look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6612)|
| 1:50:15| is to do a comparison of people who work in these other buildings and park downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6615)|
| 1:50:19| Because from the ones that I've talked to, they're either making considerably more per month than our county employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6619)|
| 1:50:26| or their organization or firm or bank or whatever they're working for pays their monthly parking for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6626)|
| 1:50:35| So it's not coming out of their pocket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6635)|
| 1:50:37| I think another thing we need to look at is the fact that if you work for the clerk's office at a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6637)|
| 1:50:42| or for any county department that has an off-site location, like one of the satellite centers, the convenience centers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6642)|
| 1:50:52| the health department, you don't pay parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6652)|
| 1:50:56| But if you work in the city county building, you're effectively making $1,000 less a month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6656)|
| 1:51:02| or close to $1,000 less a month than your counterpart who works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6662)|
| 1:51:07| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6667)|
| 1:51:09| You all know what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6669)|
| 1:51:10| I'm just going to be quiet now because you know what I'm going to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6670)|
| 1:51:12| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6672)|
| 1:51:13| So I think there's a lot of things that we need to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6673)|
| 1:51:17| But I think in light of the fact that we've not been able to give raises, not even cost of living raises to our employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6677)|
| 1:51:23| but we've been asking them to pay more and more, that this would be a welcome gesture that we postpone this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6683)|
| 1:51:30| until this committee is able to reconvene and look at these issues one more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6690)|
| 1:51:38| And that would be putting it off until probably budget, the next budget cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6698)|
| 1:51:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6704)|
| 1:51:45| Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6705)|
| 1:51:46| Yes, I think, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6706)|
| 1:51:47| Mr. Smith, if I might ask him a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6707)|
| 1:51:49| You were part of this committee, were you not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6709)|
| 1:51:51| Now, the structure was you had city representatives, county representatives, and PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6711)|
| 1:51:55| Was there anybody else with schools involved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6715)|
| 1:51:57| Sheriff's department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6717)|
| 1:51:58| And city police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6718)|
| 1:51:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6719)|
| 1:52:00| So everybody was at the table on this in terms of making these recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6720)|
| 1:52:04| I like the idea of revisiting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6724)|
| 1:52:06| I think it's a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6726)|
| 1:52:07| But I also want us to take another look at the people who pay for this building, and that's our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6727)|
| 1:52:13| Should they have more access to this building during the course of a day, but also when we have night meetings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6733)|
| 1:52:20| If there's a night city council meeting, that's why I was asking about the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6740)|
| 1:52:24| Is it possible to make this building accessible to people who come to a night city council meeting, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6744)|
| 1:52:29| or a night commission workshop as opposed to having them walk a couple of blocks at 10, 11 o'clock at night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6749)|
| 1:52:35| when we have plenty of spaces in this building available?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6755)|
| 1:52:38| I know that I've heard all the arguments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6758)|
| 1:52:41| I don't buy them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6761)|
| 1:52:43| I think that we need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6763)|
| 1:52:45| Now is the time for us to take another look at seeing if perhaps some spaces, at least during certain times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6765)|
| 1:52:51| could be made available to our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6771)|
| 1:52:53| So I would like to suggest that Mr. Smith be on that committee again as our vice chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6773)|
| 1:52:58| and perhaps you take the lead in getting this committee together and let's address some of these issues again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6778)|
| 1:53:02| I think it's healthy to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6782)|
| 1:53:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6786)|
| 1:53:07| Mr. Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6787)|
| 1:53:08| I don't care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6788)|
| 1:53:09| Amy, you need to go with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6789)|
| 1:53:10| I want you to hear what they said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6790)|
| 1:53:12| Because, Mike, I'm with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6792)|
| 1:53:14| I want to open it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6794)|
| 1:53:15| But when you hear from the sheriff's department and PBA about how compelling it is to still keep it under lock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6795)|
| 1:53:20| and key, I mean, let's look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6800)|
| 1:53:23| But I definitely want to look at it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6803)|
| 1:53:26| I would not care to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6806)|
| 1:53:29| Amy, you make some good points about you're talking about the people around that may not be making as much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6809)|
| 1:53:35| I thoroughly, 100 percent agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6815)|
| 1:53:37| But also, they're paying, the people are not paying near what we are paying for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6817)|
| 1:53:42| They're paying a lot more for health insurance than what our people are paying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6822)|
| 1:53:46| This comes out to $2.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6826)|
| 1:53:48| If you want the best, there's three places where you can park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6828)|
| 1:53:51| You can park here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6831)|
| 1:53:52| For so much, you can park cheaper at Dwight Castle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6832)|
| 1:53:55| And for $15, you can go to the Coliseum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6835)|
| 1:53:59| So if you get the best of the best, it's $2.37 a day or $47.50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6839)|
| 1:54:04| I think, Chris, that's what you said, $47.50 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6844)|
| 1:54:07| That is what they're paying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6847)|
| 1:54:08| Next door is $120.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6848)|
| 1:54:11| So our people are getting quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6851)|
| 1:54:13| They're getting a great bargain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6853)|
| 1:54:15| But going back to what Commissioner Hammond says, you know, the taxpayers paid for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6855)|
| 1:54:20| The taxpayers paid for this garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6860)|
| 1:54:22| And we're not getting to use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6862)|
| 1:54:23| You can use it after 6 o'clock at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6863)|
| 1:54:25| But during the day, they can't come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6865)|
| 1:54:28| It does cause them to want to go out to the satellite offices out there and be an easier parking form there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6868)|
| 1:54:35| But I still think $2.37 is a great bargain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6875)|
| 1:54:39| And the taxpayers are not showing any sympathy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6879)|
| 1:54:43| Mr. Caldwell, did you want to comment before we continue to beat you up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6883)|
| 1:54:48| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6888)|
| 1:54:50| One thing I would mention that after 5 o'clock, the parking deck is open to the public when you first come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6890)|
| 1:55:00| And how many spaces is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6900)|
| 1:55:01| That's about 100 or so?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6901)|
| 1:55:05| Fifty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6905)|
| 1:55:06| Fifty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6906)|
| 1:55:07| I would also say this, and Commissioner Smith may remember this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6907)|
| 1:55:12| During the whole process of when the committee was meeting, it was going to cost about $500,000 to open this garage to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6912)|
| 1:55:21| And so that was one argument of why not to open it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6921)|
| 1:55:27| I would also mention with this resolution that if you all do pass this, the city has to do the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6927)|
| 1:55:35| We want some to be equal on both sides of the ledger as far as that goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6935)|
| 1:55:42| And I got a call from Dale Smith today, as you all know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6942)|
| 1:55:45| Dale is head of PBAC, COO of PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6945)|
| 1:55:49| And I think he talked to Commissioner Brules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6949)|
| 1:55:54| And what he mentioned to me was to ask if you all would consider not reestablishing the parking committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6954)|
| 1:56:02| He said they did what they were supposed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6962)|
| 1:56:05| But now the city and the county can jointly decide what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6965)|
| 1:56:08| So if you want to, I mean, we can work with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6968)|
| 1:56:13| I'm actually in a once-a-month meeting with the city and PBA to go over things that relate to this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6973)|
| 1:56:20| That's why he asked me to relate to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6980)|
| 1:56:22| It's your all's decision, but I'm just doing my part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6982)|
| 1:56:28| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6988)|
| 1:56:30| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6990)|
| 1:56:32| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6992)|
| 1:56:33| I guess I'm going to argue the other side that Commissioner Hammond and Smith argued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6993)|
| 1:56:39| And that's, you know, we've been talking about letting the public park in a parking garage for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=6999)|
| 1:56:49| You know, Jack Sharp, you go way back when.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7009)|
| 1:56:52| This is an old conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7012)|
| 1:56:54| And, ladies and gentlemen, we built it wrong for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7014)|
| 1:56:58| We built it pre-9-11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7018)|
| 1:57:00| The facility can't take that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7020)|
| 1:57:05| I would hate to be sitting up here saying, darn, we should have, we could have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7025)|
| 1:57:13| There's a reason we can't open this garage up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7033)|
| 1:57:16| Really, if we do convene this committee, I say I would not advocate putting that in that committee's charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7036)|
| 1:57:23| We can look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7043)|
| 1:57:24| That's the reason the deck is open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7044)|
| 1:57:26| The deck isn't underneath the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7046)|
| 1:57:28| That's like letting somebody say, hey, we're commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7048)|
| 1:57:30| We're going to let our basements be open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7050)|
| 1:57:33| Okay, as long as you don't come upstairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7053)|
| 1:57:34| I mean, you know, the citizens own the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7054)|
| 1:57:38| Okay, they own the city mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7058)|
| 1:57:40| They don't have the right to go in there and have lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7060)|
| 1:57:42| Okay, we have business to do here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7062)|
| 1:57:46| This is a business building, and we do the business for the constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7066)|
| 1:57:50| But we can't control all of our constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7070)|
| 1:57:53| Somebody could do something extremely harmful if we don't take care of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7073)|
| 1:58:02| There's a lot of important stuff going on in this facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7082)|
| 1:58:06| And we happened to build a garage right underneath it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7086)|
| 1:58:10| We don't need to go back down that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7090)|
| 1:58:13| Again, we can talk about the money all day long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7093)|
| 1:58:15| We can talk about how we're going to do it, and I'm for all of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7095)|
| 1:58:19| But I am not for opening up that can of worms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7099)|
| 1:58:22| This isn't blowing smoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7102)|
| 1:58:25| This is real.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7105)|
| 1:58:26| I mean, you can take an average security outfit that does this for a living,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7106)|
| 1:58:30| and they're going to come back and say, there's no way we're going to let you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7110)|
| 1:58:34| We're going to tell you that you can open up that garage for any and everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7114)|
| 1:58:38| That's just not going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7118)|
| 1:58:41| It's not wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7121)|
| 1:58:44| We've asked the question, and we've asked the question, and we've asked the question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7124)|
| 1:58:48| and everyone has come back to us saying, don't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7128)|
| 1:58:54| We can't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7134)|
| 1:58:55| We can't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7135)|
| 1:58:56| Well, I mean, again, we can do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7136)|
| 1:58:59| but it will not be with any reputable law enforcement management agencies endorsement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7139)|
| 1:59:07| It just won't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7147)|
| 1:59:10| And so I would not be in favor of opening up this committee with a carte blanche charter to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7150)|
| 1:59:20| we're going to revisit this whole process again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7160)|
| 1:59:24| So, you know, I do think we can look at the rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7164)|
| 1:59:27| We can look at, you know, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7167)|
| 1:59:29| We should be parking our county vehicles over at the Coliseum and bringing them over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7169)|
| 1:59:34| That's going to open up a whole lot of spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7174)|
| 1:59:37| We're not doing a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7177)|
| 1:59:38| There's some things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7178)|
| 1:59:39| There's some follow-up items that that committee recommended I think we need to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7179)|
| 1:59:43| but that's not one I'm in favor of opening up that piece of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7183)|
| 1:59:47| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7187)|
| 1:59:48| Let me just give a little rebuttal to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7188)|
| 1:59:50| I'm glad you brought it up because that reminded me of what over in this grassy little area right here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7190)|
| 1:59:55| they were going to put a, I think, a three-level garage and then put a tunnel underneath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7195)|
| 2:00:00| And so the prisoners, they can drop those people in and out and not have to be exposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7200)|
| 2:00:04| I just, when you mentioned that, I just remembered that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7204)|
| 2:00:06| That's under the Ragsdale administration, and that got cut from the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7206)|
| 2:00:10| But that, and then when they do that, they're thinking that that was what the public would use that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7210)|
| 2:00:16| in a lot of handicapped spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7216)|
| 2:00:17| So that was the best plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7217)|
| 2:00:21| Ms. Burwells.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7221)|
| 2:00:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7222)|
| 2:00:25| I feel like and I agree that there needs to be a place for the public to park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7225)|
| 2:00:32| And I've discussed this with a couple of people, and, really, I think that's an issue that needs to be addressed separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7232)|
| 2:00:39| I would love to have a committee that spends their time strictly on should we open up the parking garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7239)|
| 2:00:45| And if we don't, instead of just saying, well, should we let the public park there or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7245)|
| 2:00:50| No, we shouldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7250)|
| 2:00:51| And then we just leave it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7251)|
| 2:00:53| And like I said, we've had groups look at it again and again and again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7253)|
| 2:00:56| But nobody takes the next step which is to say, well, where should the public park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7256)|
| 2:01:01| What can we do to make it easier for the public to be here for public meetings and to come and do their business downtown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7261)|
| 2:01:08| So I would like to see a group or a task force that that's their sole focus is should the public park in the parking garage or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7268)|
| 2:01:18| And if not, then what can we do to make it easier for them to come in here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7278)|
| 2:01:23| I would like to separate those two things, frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7283)|
| 2:01:26| and have one that their whole business is about what's the fairest parking policy for city and county employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7286)|
| 2:01:34| And then one that their focus is what's the fairest thing for the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7294)|
| 2:01:40| That's what I would prefer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7300)|
| 2:01:41| And two dollars and however many cents a day, it is a bargain unless you're making, you know, 20,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7301)|
| 2:01:49| And then it's no matter how good a bargain it is, it's still a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7309)|
| 2:01:55| And the fact is that if your counterpart is not being charged anything to park at the health department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7315)|
| 2:02:00| or at a satellite office, then it's even, you know, the bite is even greater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7320)|
| 2:02:06| It's just not fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7326)|
| 2:02:08| And I don't have all the answers to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7328)|
| 2:02:10| I'm just saying we need to look at this and come up with something better than what we're doing right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7330)|
| 2:02:17| I do know that I spoke with the city, and the city is willing to reconvene this committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7337)|
| 2:02:24| and see what they come up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7344)|
| 2:02:27| So that's not a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7347)|
| 2:02:30| I'm sorry that Dale doesn't want the whole committee to meet again if it's a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7350)|
| 2:02:36| I mean, I don't get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7356)|
| 2:02:37| It doesn't have to be Dale on the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7357)|
| 2:02:39| We could have somebody else from PBA or not even, you know, if PBA doesn't want to participate, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7359)|
| 2:02:45| that would be fine with me, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7365)|
| 2:02:48| I would leave that up to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7368)|
| 2:02:52| And so does anybody remember where the public parks before 9-11, before they shut the garage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7372)|
| 2:03:00| Oh, they had parking in here, but it was controlled access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7380)|
| 2:03:03| I mean, they had to pay to park, pay to get out, but White Castle was the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7383)|
| 2:03:06| But where did the employees park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7386)|
| 2:03:10| The same?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7390)|
| 2:03:11| Just intermingled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7391)|
| 2:03:12| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7392)|
| 2:03:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7393)|
| 2:03:15| So everybody parked here previous, and now it's only city county employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7395)|
| 2:03:20| Chris?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7400)|
| 2:03:21| I wouldn't say that everyone parked here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7401)|
| 2:03:24| There's 822 spots approximately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7404)|
| 2:03:27| When it was open to the public, there was, I think, 45 to 50 spots that was open to the public each day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7407)|
| 2:03:37| And the public can park at Castle or can park at Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7417)|
| 2:03:42| Main Street is often forgotten, but it's actually an easier walk if you park in Main to get to here than it is from Castle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7422)|
| 2:03:50| That's just my two cents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7430)|
| 2:03:52| So, basically, employees have parked here or at Castle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7432)|
| 2:03:57| And at Castle, employees can park in for $30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7437)|
| 2:04:00| It's half the rate, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7440)|
| 2:04:03| One other issue that has come up during this, and it's sensitive, it's a sensitive issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7443)|
| 2:04:08| So I certainly don't want to be misunderstood or misquoted on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7448)|
| 2:04:15| I think you all understand how passionate I am about equal access for people with disabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7455)|
| 2:04:22| But there is a law that says that if you have a handicap parking tag, you park for free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7462)|
| 2:04:30| We have had a huge jump in the number of handicap tags belonging to county employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7470)|
| 2:04:41| The city, I think, has seven handicap tags, and county has, like, over 100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7481)|
| 2:04:49| And so I think that that's an issue that this committee needs to look at as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7489)|
| 2:04:53| I know that our finance department has asked the AG's office to give an opinion on whether or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7493)|
| 2:05:01| since this is a closed parking garage, it's not open to the public, does that still apply?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7501)|
| 2:05:08| The free parking, does that still apply in this parking garage or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7508)|
| 2:05:12| So it will be really interesting to see what that opinion says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7512)|
| 2:05:16| But I feel like, you know, if we were doing a better job of compensating our employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7516)|
| 2:05:23| they wouldn't be looking around for ways to cut costs for themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7523)|
| 2:05:28| Because I feel like probably not all 128 of those permits are necessarily being used by people who are truly disabled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7528)|
| 2:05:39| So, and you don't see that problem with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7539)|
| 2:05:43| And I think the answer lies in the way that we treat our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7543)|
| 2:05:48| Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7548)|
| 2:05:50| Well, I'd like to see the parking committee go ahead and meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7550)|
| 2:05:53| I understand Mr. Smith's reservations about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7553)|
| 2:05:56| However, I think that if we're going to bring everybody to the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7556)|
| 2:05:59| we need to have everybody at the table to talk about the parking situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7559)|
| 2:06:03| I guess the question that I have is, is do we still open up this garage for football games?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7563)|
| 2:06:09| I think we do, don't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7569)|
| 2:06:10| Do we not open up the garage for Boomsday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7570)|
| 2:06:12| I know we do because I was here for Boomsday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7572)|
| 2:06:15| You see, we're sending mixed signals here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7575)|
| 2:06:16| We're saying, no, we can't open up this garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7576)|
| 2:06:19| However, for certain events, we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7579)|
| 2:06:22| I just feel like that we need to relook at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7582)|
| 2:06:25| And if they come back and say no, then let's don't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7585)|
| 2:06:28| But to open it up for certain days during the year that's convenient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7588)|
| 2:06:34| and to say to the public, well, no, we're not going to let you park here at all, I think that sends a mixed message.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7594)|
| 2:06:39| So I would like to have this revisited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7599)|
| 2:06:42| And, again, it may be that we don't open it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7602)|
| 2:06:45| but I think that it's time to at least ask the question again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7605)|
| 2:06:48| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7608)|
| 2:06:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7611)|
| 2:06:52| We've got a motion to delay this rate increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7612)|
| 2:06:56| Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Coll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7616)|
| 2:06:58| We'll go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7618)|
| 2:06:59| Fair point, but since I have all the answers, I'll go ahead and answer Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7619)|
| 2:07:03| When those are open, like the football game, it is open and Boomsday, they do scan cars as they come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7623)|
| 2:07:09| If you show your badge, they won't scan you nor charge you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7629)|
| 2:07:13| But they do scan vehicles and do like the look under the car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7633)|
| 2:07:17| I think what they would also say, and this is just what I think I heard from that committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7637)|
| 2:07:22| is it's more of a security thing when people is in the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7642)|
| 2:07:27| I know there's two sides to every story, but I just wanted to tell you what my thought process was on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7647)|
| 2:07:32| And I do believe the But also let me ask this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7652)|
| 2:07:35| If we're, let's say that it were open during the day, there would be people there to scan them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7655)|
| 2:07:39| and people would pay to park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7659)|
| 2:07:41| I mean, it's not like we're just, you know, opening it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7661)|
| 2:07:44| True.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7664)|
| 2:07:45| So, no, there would be security measures in place to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7665)|
| 2:07:48| I'm not advocating at all that we just allow anybody and everybody to come in with no security and no scanning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7668)|
| 2:07:53| But I'm just saying it works for football games.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7673)|
| 2:07:55| It works for Boomsday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7675)|
| 2:07:57| And we're able to get the cars in and out in an efficient manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7677)|
| 2:07:59| It just seems to me that if there were X number of spaces available, that there is a way to work this out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7679)|
| 2:08:04| to where there can be some access here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7684)|
| 2:08:06| There was, and that was at a cost of $500,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7686)|
| 2:08:10| I'm sorry, I don't buy it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7690)|
| 2:08:12| It's moving the scanners and employees to each end of the building as you come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7692)|
| 2:08:18| It costs $500,000 to scan cars for football games and Boomsday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7698)|
| 2:08:22| And the equipment on each end of the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7702)|
| 2:08:25| That's what it costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7705)|
| 2:08:26| I mean, that's what they said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7706)|
| 2:08:28| What he's saying is, Mike, is right now he would have to add at the elevator here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7708)|
| 2:08:32| and on both ends he'd have to add new scanners and new staff five days a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7712)|
| 2:08:36| Oh, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7716)|
| 2:08:37| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7717)|
| 2:08:38| I'm just saying that there is a way to work this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7718)|
| 2:08:40| So, anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7720)|
| 2:08:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7722)|
| 2:08:43| Thank you, Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7723)|
| 2:08:44| More lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7724)|
| 2:08:45| Mr. Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7725)|
| 2:08:46| Yeah, I just want to speak to kind of what Chris was talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7726)|
| 2:08:49| When you talk about Boomsday and football, you're opening up 600 spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7729)|
| 2:08:52| And it pays for itself whenever people pay to park in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7732)|
| 2:08:55| But when you do it every day, Monday through Friday, and open up 40 spaces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7735)|
| 2:08:58| and you add scanners at the entry, both entries, and then you add scanners at parking entries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7738)|
| 2:09:06| and then you'd have to have people scanners at both elevators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7746)|
| 2:09:10| There's where you get your $500,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7750)|
| 2:09:12| It's not me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7752)|
| 2:09:13| You say, well, you make plenty of money on football.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7753)|
| 2:09:15| Yeah, but you're opening up 600 spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7755)|
| 2:09:16| You're not opening up 40 Monday through Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7756)|
| 2:09:18| So it's a vast difference in opening it up for football or Boomsday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7758)|
| 2:09:23| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7763)|
| 2:09:24| Make a substitute recommendation or motion to recommendation without.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7764)|
| 2:09:30| To send on without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7770)|
| 2:09:32| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7772)|
| 2:09:33| And if we can, Amy, can Dale be here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7773)|
| 2:09:35| Can Dale be here Monday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7775)|
| 2:09:36| I'll certainly invite him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7776)|
| 2:09:37| Yeah, because he's got some of those answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7777)|
| 2:09:39| I'll call him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7779)|
| 2:09:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7781)|
| 2:09:42| And Mr. Caldwell, see if you could do that, too, have him come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7782)|
| 2:09:46| Mr. Brown, do you have something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7786)|
| 2:09:48| Yes, just two comments along that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7788)|
| 2:09:53| I'd like to know where you're going to find space to put 40 more spaces, number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7793)|
| 2:09:59| And the second thing is the folks that are in here on Boomsday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7799)|
| 2:10:03| and football days are in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7803)|
| 2:10:06| And there are spaces because we're not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7806)|
| 2:10:09| And all of our hundreds of employees are not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7809)|
| 2:10:12| So there are spaces available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7812)|
| 2:10:14| All of you, since you've been on this commission, have had to go to Dwight Castle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7814)|
| 2:10:20| at least once or twice in your tenure here because this place was full on commission day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7820)|
| 2:10:28| So you've got to keep all that stuff in mind, folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7828)|
| 2:10:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7834)|
| 2:10:35| No more lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7835)|
| 2:10:36| We're going to send it on without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7836)|
| 2:10:39| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7839)|
| 2:10:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7840)|
| 2:10:41| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7841)|
| 2:10:42| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7842)|
| 2:10:52| You all want to take a break?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7852)|
| 2:10:53| Okay, let's take ten minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7853)|
| 2:10:58| So that we can make sure that these vendors are using the property legally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7858)|
| 2:11:03| having permission and a release from the property owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7863)|
| 2:11:06| and then also be able to make sure there's proper parking for these vendors so that they're not setting up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7866)|
| 2:11:12| on the side of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7872)|
| 2:11:15| Okay, thank you, Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7875)|
| 2:11:16| Mr. McKenzie, or did you have something else, Mr. Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7876)|
| 2:11:19| I just thought, Roy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7879)|
| 2:11:20| I thought that was really good that you had the written permission from the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7880)|
| 2:11:23| I thought that was good to have that in there and make sure that there was adequate parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7883)|
| 2:11:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7889)|
| 2:11:30| Ms. Brawls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7890)|
| 2:11:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7892)|
| 2:11:33| I don't know, Larry, if this has happened to you since the story came out in the paper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7893)|
| 2:11:37| but I've been inundated with angry phone calls from people who are licensed to have real businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7897)|
| 2:11:47| And I just want to reassure them that if you follow all the rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7907)|
| 2:11:51| and you're doing what you're supposed to be doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7911)|
| 2:11:53| it doesn't apply to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7913)|
| 2:11:54| So I think that, Roy, y'all have done a great job putting this together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7914)|
| 2:11:59| I think it's going to make our community safer and certainly more attractive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7919)|
| 2:12:03| So thank you so much for doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7923)|
| 2:12:06| And I want to make sure everybody understands that if you're already doing what the law says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7926)|
| 2:12:12| this is not going to hurt you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7932)|
| 2:12:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7934)|
| 2:12:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7935)|
| 2:12:16| Other things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7936)|
| 2:12:17| Roy, I had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7937)|
| 2:12:19| Does this --" there was a --" I had a call about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7939)|
| 2:12:21| does this affect vendors who would sell firewood or produce?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7941)|
| 2:12:28| This would not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7948)|
| 2:12:29| There is an exemption in this ordinance that allows for sale of agricultural products.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7949)|
| 2:12:36| But I would like to say that the zoning ordinance only allows legal sale of agricultural products in an ag zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7956)|
| 2:12:44| if it's grown and produced on that property and or a CA zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7964)|
| 2:12:49| because CA allows for farming of all types.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7969)|
| 2:12:52| So, basically, if you have a roadside stand and you're on somebody else's property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7972)|
| 2:12:57| then you probably are not legal anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7977)|
| 2:12:59| unless you have a lease and you have obtained a permit through Knox County Code Administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7979)|
| 2:13:05| Or they can go to the farmer's market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7985)|
| 2:13:07| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7987)|
| 2:13:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7988)|
| 2:13:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7989)|
| 2:13:10| Mr. Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7990)|
| 2:13:11| That was my question because they're, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7991)|
| 2:13:13| not everybody from deep south Knoxville wants to go all the way out to farmer's market out on Washington Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=7993)|
| 2:13:20| to buy fresh produce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8000)|
| 2:13:22| So there needs to be some type of place, way, whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8002)|
| 2:13:29| that these temporary once-a-week type produce places, you know, farmer's type markets can set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8009)|
| 2:13:38| Some of the churches do them on their private property, which I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8018)|
| 2:13:41| Does that affect something like that, Roy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8021)|
| 2:13:44| I don't think so, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8024)|
| 2:13:47| But one of the things that I think that if a church decided to have a rummage sale six times a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8027)|
| 2:13:54| or sell off of their property, I think that there would not be anybody complaining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8034)|
| 2:13:59| Our office generally works off of complaint driven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8039)|
| 2:14:02| And so we would only be out probably for complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8042)|
| 2:14:07| I don't think anybody would be complaining about those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8047)|
| 2:14:13| Mr. Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8053)|
| 2:14:14| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8054)|
| 2:14:15| I'm reminded of the article today, today's paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8055)|
| 2:14:19| Toward the end of it was a person selling produce somewhere on Clinton Highway near the Anderson County line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8059)|
| 2:14:27| Would that person be able to continue to do what they're doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8067)|
| 2:14:33| Probably not unless it's their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8073)|
| 2:14:37| And then, well, the second, it's a compound question then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8077)|
| 2:14:41| Do they have to grow the produce on that property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8081)|
| 2:14:45| The zoning ordinance requires that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8085)|
| 2:14:52| I didn't, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8092)|
| 2:14:53| It already requires that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8093)|
| 2:14:54| I mean, doesn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8094)|
| 2:14:55| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8095)|
| 2:14:56| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8096)|
| 2:14:57| The one on Clinton Highway operates out of that farm that backs up to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8097)|
| 2:15:00| But, I mean, none of that's grown there that I'm aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8100)|
| 2:15:03| Are we talking about near Emery Road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8103)|
| 2:15:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8105)|
| 2:15:06| That property is C.A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8106)|
| 2:15:08| And if the people are legally there, then they could, and produce that on site, then they are legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8108)|
| 2:15:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8115)|
| 2:15:16| So, Roy, if a fellow has some firewood and he fills his pickup truck with firewood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8116)|
| 2:15:22| and he takes it to a location, an intersection, some place that's, you know, heavily traveled, what would his,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8122)|
| 2:15:30| what would he be required or could he legally be permitted to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8130)|
| 2:15:35| By the ordinance, this ordinance, it would not regulate agricultural products, but the zoning ordinance does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8135)|
| 2:15:43| So, technically, he would need to sell that somewhere that he's allowed to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8143)|
| 2:15:50| which would be someone else's property that has a legal business and be able to sell through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8150)|
| 2:15:58| I think the clerk's office also has a different law that they may sell licenses or permits for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8158)|
| 2:16:08| And those are for a 14-day permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8168)|
| 2:16:11| And people that are trying to follow the law and they sell goods in our county, they get these permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8171)|
| 2:16:20| But they're selling them on someone else's property where they're being given legal right to sell there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8180)|
| 2:16:27| which may be a hotel, motel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8187)|
| 2:16:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8189)|
| 2:16:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8190)|
| 2:16:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8191)|
| 2:16:32| Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8192)|
| 2:16:33| Just a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8193)|
| 2:16:35| If I own a piece of property and someone comes and says, hey, can I sell sunglasses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8195)|
| 2:16:39| And I say, okay, you can do it for one day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8199)|
| 2:16:41| Do they have to get a permit for that if they've gotten approval from the property owner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8201)|
| 2:16:45| The clerk's office has, and it's a similar law that they're selling under that requires a permit for 14 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8205)|
| 2:16:54| They have to tell in their application specific times and places that they sell during those 14 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8214)|
| 2:17:02| And the clerk sells a permit or license for that today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8222)|
| 2:17:07| How much is that, by the way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8227)|
| 2:17:09| Fifty dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8229)|
| 2:17:10| And that's for all good for all 14 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8230)|
| 2:17:12| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8232)|
| 2:17:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8235)|
| 2:17:16| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8236)|
| 2:17:18| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8238)|
| 2:17:20| We have a convenience store in our community that has a huge parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8240)|
| 2:17:26| And one day he's selling apples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8246)|
| 2:17:30| The next day he's got honey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8250)|
| 2:17:32| He's set up now selling mums and pumpkins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8252)|
| 2:17:37| Sometimes they pull in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8257)|
| 2:17:39| You know, last week a guy pulled in there, and he had three sets of scaffolding that he sold while I was sitting there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8259)|
| 2:17:45| having lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8265)|
| 2:17:46| But anyway, what about these type of guys that come in on a commercial parking lot like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8266)|
| 2:17:54| Is this the actual business that's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8274)|
| 2:17:57| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8277)|
| 2:17:58| Those would be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8278)|
| 2:17:59| I own the store, and you come to me and say, I'm going to sell some honey out here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8279)|
| 2:18:04| So I set up my table out there on your parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8284)|
| 2:18:07| I think that that would be the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8287)|
| 2:18:10| The clerk would need to sell the 14-day license, and it would give specific times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8290)|
| 2:18:16| and places where people sell these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8296)|
| 2:18:19| They would have legal right to do it on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8299)|
| 2:18:22| The only thing from a zoning standpoint that I would question is using up required parking spaces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8302)|
| 2:18:30| or creating some kind of a zoning issue of that effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8310)|
| 2:18:35| If you have to have 50 parking places and you use 25 of them to set up the goods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8315)|
| 2:18:39| then you would be in violation of not having enough parking to operate your business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8319)|
| 2:18:45| Well, this is a convenience store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8325)|
| 2:18:46| I mean, there's some days there might be six different vendors set up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8326)|
| 2:18:51| So, I mean, it in itself is a farmer's market, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8331)|
| 2:18:58| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8338)|
| 2:18:59| I think that we could, under this ordinance, and maybe the clerk could enforce the regulations of this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8339)|
| 2:19:08| and the other ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8348)|
| 2:19:09| And I'm not sure if these are one and the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8349)|
| 2:19:12| And maybe the law director could answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8352)|
| 2:19:16| They may have some input on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8356)|
| 2:19:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8360)|
| 2:19:21| Mr. McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8361)|
| 2:19:23| Hey, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8363)|
| 2:19:24| You know, I guess I'm going at this a different way, which is why I'm in favor of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8364)|
| 2:19:30| And it's more so, you know, we have law-abiding, because all of these scenarios are illegal today, from what I heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8370)|
| 2:19:41| So we have law-abiding taxpaying, property taxpaying, business taxpaying folk out there trying to sell their own mums| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8381)|
| 2:19:51| and their own firewood and their own cornhole, you know, toss and their own scaffolding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8391)|
| 2:19:56| So, you know, for a guy or girl just to kind of get a nice space with a good amount of traffic coming by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8396)|
| 2:20:03| and a nice pull-off to be able to sell that routinely, you know, I have issues with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8403)|
| 2:20:11| And I think the ones these Tuesdays, like Roy said, they're never going to get that call on those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8411)|
| 2:20:19| And so if that's they show up and got something they need to get rid of, I don't think we'll ever get called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8419)|
| 2:20:26| But these folks off of Ann Marie and these other places, or Karnes, or Powell, I see them on my way to places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8426)|
| 2:20:35| I see the place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8435)|
| 2:20:36| The place in South Knoxville, you know, I said, I'm going to buy a cornhole set there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8436)|
| 2:20:40| That's not a bad place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8440)|
| 2:20:41| So he probably doesn't get a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8441)|
| 2:20:44| He's the cheapest around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8444)|
| 2:20:45| And they're good, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8445)|
| 2:20:47| So, you know, he probably doesn't get a lot of complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8447)|
| 2:20:51| But I guess I just look at it that, you know, we have, you know, a guy or girl wants to go into business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8451)|
| 2:20:57| There's some, you know, some avenues to get them into business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8457)|
| 2:21:01| And that's why I like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8461)|
| 2:21:04| It kind of cleans things up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8464)|
| 2:21:06| There's people making a lot of money out there, and they're making it without, you know, paying the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8466)|
| 2:21:12| Fair share like other business owners are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8472)|
| 2:21:18| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8478)|
| 2:21:19| One last comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8479)|
| 2:21:20| Royce, you said they were complaint driven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8480)|
| 2:21:23| As long as we're in the community, and I shop there a lot, as long as we keep buying goods there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8483)|
| 2:21:27| and are happy with them, I guess we're not going to complain and we're not going to worry, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8487)|
| 2:21:33| I don't know if I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8493)|
| 2:21:37| Okay, we have a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8497)|
| 2:21:38| This is on the first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8498)|
| 2:21:40| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8500)|
| 2:21:41| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8501)|
| 2:21:42| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8502)|
| 2:21:43| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8503)|
| 2:21:44| Roy, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8504)|

| 2:22:05| She may need oxygen to finish up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8525)|
| 2:22:06| I don't know whether we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8526)|
| 2:22:08| Mr. Law Director, can we waive the reading of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8528)|
| 2:22:11| I don't think you need it on the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8531)|
| 2:22:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8533)|

| 2:28:14| That's been discussed enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8894)|
| 2:28:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8896)|
| 2:28:17| Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8897)|

| 2:28:19| With regards to the article in the newspaper yesterday, and I believe there was a series.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8899)|

| 2:28:29| or something to that effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8909)|
| 2:28:30| Mr. Ballard said that he was looking at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8910)|
| 2:28:33| I'm wondering if we could ask him to join us as part of this revenue picture to get his thoughts on what he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8913)|

| 2:28:46| Could we contact him, Madam Clerk, get a hold of the assessor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8926)|
| 2:28:51| That would be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8931)|
| 2:28:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8933)|
| 2:28:54| Do we have any other business before commission today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8934)|
| 2:28:57| I'm seeing none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8937)|
| 2:28:58| We're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8938)|
| 2:28:59| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8939)|
| 2:29:00| We're adjourned and then we've got to do committee on committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8940)|
| 2:29:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8945)|
| 2:29:06| So we're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8946)|
| 2:29:07| And now we're into our session committee on committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8947)|
| 2:29:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8978)|
| 2:29:54| Are you sure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8994)|
| 2:29:56| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8996)|
| 2:29:57| You're not on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8997)|
| 2:29:59| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=8999)|
| 2:30:00| It's committee on committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9000)|
| 2:30:02| Committee on committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9002)|
| 2:30:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9033)|
| 2:30:40| Committee appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9040)|
| 2:30:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9041)|
| 2:30:42| So we're coming back into session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9042)|
| 2:30:43| We're calling this committee on committees to order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9043)|
| 2:30:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9047)|
| 2:30:48| And the first item is for the committee on committees, which is McKenzie, Briggs, Brown, Brolls, and Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9048)|
| 2:30:55| I'll convene this committee to select the chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9055)|
| 2:31:01| And then after the chair is selected, the chair can conduct the vice chair and the selection of secretary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9061)|
| 2:31:09| Now, one of the things that's come up in discussion with the law department has been we have not had a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9069)|
| 2:31:15| secretary to log minutes or take minutes in our committee meetings assigned as an officer to committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9075)|
| 2:31:23| So we need to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9083)|
| 2:31:24| And Ms. Rossberg has assured me that she's going to make this an easy task before we have a fight over who's going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9084)|
| 2:31:31| to be secretary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9091)|
| 2:31:33| And so she's going to make this easier by way of some form type thing that the secretary could actually use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9093)|
| 2:31:44| and still be aware of, which presents a little bit of a problem whenever you're a secretary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9104)|
| 2:31:50| and you've got to take notes and you've got to vote on the issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9110)|
| 2:31:53| And sometimes that could be a bit of a conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9113)|
| 2:31:56| But she's going to make that easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9116)|
| 2:31:58| So, first of all, let's take nominees for chairman of our committee on committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9118)|
| 2:32:07| I nominate Sam McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9127)|
| 2:32:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9130)|
| 2:32:11| And we have to keep in mind also that only one, you can only be a chair of one of our committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9131)|
| 2:32:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9138)|
| 2:32:19| So that may jeopardize or cause some changes in some other committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9139)|
| 2:32:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9144)|
| 2:32:25| Any other nominees for chair of the committee on committees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9145)|
| 2:32:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9150)|
| 2:32:31| Seeing none, by acclamation, we will make Mr. McKenzie chair of committee on committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9151)|
| 2:32:37| Thank you, Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9157)|
| 2:32:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9159)|
| 2:32:40| Mr. McKenzie, you can go ahead and conduct vice chair and secretary if you'd like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9160)|
| 2:32:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9165)|
| 2:32:46| I'm doing it from this seat here, if you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9166)|
| 2:32:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9168)|
| 2:32:49| So the floor is now open for nominees for vice chair, committee on committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9169)|
| 2:32:56| I'd like to nominate Dave Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9176)|
| 2:32:59| Dave Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9179)|
| 2:33:00| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9180)|
| 2:33:02| Any other nominees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9182)|
| 2:33:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9184)|
| 2:33:05| By acclamation, we're going to appoint, make Dave Wright our vice chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9185)|
| 2:33:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9191)|
| 2:33:12| We'll move on to Ag Extension Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9192)|
| 2:33:15| You guys have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9195)|
| 2:33:16| We've got to have a secretary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9196)|
| 2:33:17| Secretary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9197)|
| 2:33:18| Oh, darn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9198)|
| 2:33:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9199)|
| 2:33:20| The floor is now open for secretary for the committee on committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9200)|
| 2:33:27| Don't everyone jump up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9207)|
| 2:33:28| Mike Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9208)|
| 2:33:32| Mike Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9212)|
| 2:33:36| Any other nominees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9216)|
| 2:33:38| Hearing none, Mike Brown will be our secretary by acclamation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9218)|
| 2:33:47| And now we'll move on to Ag Extension Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9227)|
| 2:33:52| Currently, that committee consists of Amy Bross, Richard Briggs, and Dave Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9232)|
| 2:34:01| So, Mr. Law Director, can only the committee on committee people nominate and vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9241)|
| 2:34:09| That's correct, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9249)|
| 2:34:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9250)|
| 2:34:11| That's what I thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9251)|
| 2:34:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9252)|
| 2:34:13| Amy is nominating herself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9253)|
| 2:34:14| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9254)|
| 2:34:15| Oh, she needs the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9255)|
| 2:34:16| Well, actually, I have two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9256)|
| 2:34:18| You know, I've been on several of these committees for the last several years, and we have never met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9258)|
| 2:34:24| So, do we really need to have all these committees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9264)|
| 2:34:27| Are these committees actually performing any function?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9267)|
| 2:34:31| Or can we go through and eliminate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9271)|
| 2:34:33| I mean, why are we having these committees if they never meet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9273)|
| 2:34:39| A lot of these are in your charter to be appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9279)|
| 2:34:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9282)|
| 2:34:43| So, whether you meet or not, you have them if they need to be called upon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9283)|
| 2:34:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9288)|
| 2:34:49| And my other question would be, and I think I asked this last time, I would like to ask for volunteers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9289)|
| 2:34:56| for anyone who wants to serve on a particular committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9296)|
| 2:35:00| I want to make sure that they are plugged into the committee that they want to serve on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9300)|
| 2:35:05| And then after that, I would recommend that we just reappoint everybody as they are already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9305)|
| 2:35:12| I'd like to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9312)|
| 2:35:14| And you're on there, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9314)|
| 2:35:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9318)|
| 2:35:19| I've got a question for Ms. Rosberger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9319)|
| 2:35:20| I've got a list of all the committees with the standing committees filled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9320)|
| 2:35:27| What you just passed out were empty slots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9327)|
| 2:35:31| You passed out both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9331)|
| 2:35:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9332)|
| 2:35:33| You got both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9333)|
| 2:35:34| Would the chair suggest all of these to just be filled as before at one time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9334)|
| 2:35:42| and then we could accept that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9342)|
| 2:35:44| Is that permissible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9344)|
| 2:35:46| Yeah, that's what I was wondering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9346)|
| 2:35:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9347)|
| 2:35:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9348)|
| 2:35:49| I guess my question is, we must have done something wrong the last time that we did it right after we elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9349)|
| 2:35:57| I think what it was, is that everybody was throwing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9357)|
| 2:36:00| The whole committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9360)|
| 2:36:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9361)|
| 2:36:02| And it needs to be a committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9362)|
| 2:36:02| It needs to come from a committee member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9362)|
| 2:36:03| It needs to come from a committee member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9363)|
| 2:36:04| I will make the motion that we just reappoint everyone the way it's listed right here on this piece of paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9364)|
| 2:36:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9369)|
| 2:36:10| And that's been properly moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9370)|
| 2:36:14| So if I could have a vote of all the committee members by raising their right hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9374)|
| 2:36:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9379)|
| 2:36:20| The motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9380)|
| 2:36:22| So I know at least one conflict at this point, and that is the cable TV committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9382)|
| 2:36:28| I'm the chair of that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9388)|
| 2:36:29| It sounds like I can only be chair of one committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9389)|
| 2:36:32| So I will open the floor at this point for nominees for the cable TV committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9392)|
| 2:36:42| I nominate Ed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9402)|
| 2:36:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9404)|
| 2:36:45| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9405)|
| 2:36:46| We had, I think they started speaking first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9406)|
| 2:36:49| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9409)|
| 2:36:50| I was going to elevate the vice chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9410)|
| 2:36:52| I'm chair of the insolvency board, so I can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9412)|
| 2:36:55| Thank you, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9415)|
| 2:36:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9416)|
| 2:36:57| So Ed Schaus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9417)|
| 2:36:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9418)|
| 2:37:01| Any other nominees for that committee, for chair of that committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9421)|
| 2:37:07| Hearing none, Ed Schaus will be the chair of that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9427)|
| 2:37:13| Welcome, Ed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9433)|
| 2:37:14| And, Ed, with that, you know, and I spent a good month as the chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9434)|
| 2:37:20| and Jeff had, I think he served for the most part the whole time as the CTV board member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9440)|
| 2:37:29| That's an additional duty for the chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9449)|
| 2:37:32| I'm sure you will be hearing from the folks at CTV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9452)|
| 2:37:37| Now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9457)|
| 2:37:38| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9458)|
| 2:37:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9459)|
| 2:37:40| I was looking at, were we talking about the community television board or the cable TV committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9460)|
| 2:37:45| The cable TV committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9465)|
| 2:37:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9467)|
| 2:37:48| That chair serves on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9468)|
| 2:37:51| But all of these committees, you've appointed the people to the committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9471)|
| 2:37:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9475)|
| 2:37:56| I would vote on it like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9476)|
| 2:37:57| And then I would give them an order to meet and elect their respective officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9477)|
| 2:38:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9481)|
| 2:38:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9482)|
| 2:38:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9483)|
| 2:38:04| And I could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9484)|
| 2:38:05| I could, in the next month, I will notice the committees, the standing committees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9485)|
| 2:38:09| and we'll do maybe ten-minute intervals adjacent to the work session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9489)|
| 2:38:15| and we can notice them to meet and elect their officers then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9495)|
| 2:38:19| How would that be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9499)|
| 2:38:20| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9500)|
| 2:38:21| That makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9501)|
| 2:38:22| So, at this point, we've already voted to move these over, so I think my business is done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9502)|
| 2:38:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9508)|
| 2:38:29| And then the only other issue there with the committee, the standing committees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9509)|
| 2:38:34| would be the rules committee, which is already on our agenda, to meet on Monday at 1230.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9514)|
| 2:38:42| So the rules committee will meet then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9522)|
| 2:38:44| but the rest of the standing committees will be noticed to meet during the work session the following month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9524)|
| 2:38:52| Is that okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9532)|
| 2:38:53| It makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9533)|
| 2:38:54| And remember, we have a condensed schedule because of November and holidays also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9534)|
| 2:39:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9543)|
| 2:39:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9544)|
| 2:39:06| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9546)|
| 2:39:07| Do we have anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9547)|
| 2:39:09| We have another committee meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9549)|
| 2:39:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9551)|
| 2:39:12| The insolvency committee is going to meet right after this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9552)|
| 2:39:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9555)|
| 2:39:16| Any other items for committee on committees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9556)|
| 2:39:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9560)|
| 2:39:39| So let's do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9579)|
| 2:39:45| Let's vote on the approval of item 103.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9585)|
| 2:39:51| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9591)|
| 2:39:52| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9592)|
| 2:39:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9593)|
| 2:39:54| So we've got a motion to approve item 103.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9594)|
| 2:39:57| I'm sorry, 110.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9597)|
| 2:39:59| Item 110, it's number four on our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9599)|
| 2:40:02| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9602)|
| 2:40:03| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9603)|
| 2:40:05| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9605)|
| 2:40:06| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9606)|
| 2:40:07| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9607)|
| 2:40:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9608)|
| 2:40:09| Wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9609)|
| 2:40:10| Who's voting on that item right there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9610)|
| 2:40:12| Was that the commission or was that the insolvency board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9612)|
| 2:40:14| That's the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9614)|
| 2:40:16| That's the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9616)|
| 2:40:17| You adjourned the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9617)|
| 2:40:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9619)|
| 2:40:20| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9620)|
| 2:40:22| And then, yeah, we needed to go back and approve that before we went off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9622)|
| 2:40:26| So we probably need to call the meeting back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9626)|
| 2:40:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9628)|
