| 0:08:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=491)|
| 0:08:12| Congratulations, gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=492)|
| 0:08:13| We have a big audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=493)|
| 0:08:14| Do you wish to say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=494)|
| 0:08:25| The next item I think that we should take up is the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=505)|
| 0:08:28| The agenda, the full agenda, is before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=508)|
| 0:08:37| Are there any additions or deletions or anything to be done to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=517)|
| 0:08:48| If not, if there is no objection, the agenda is set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=528)|
| 0:08:58| The agenda is set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=538)|
| 0:09:01| We will now look at standing committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=541)|
| 0:09:32| Are we going to elect officers in the cable TV committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=572)|
| 0:09:37| What you'll do is you will ask for volunteers first for the cable TV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=577)|
| 0:09:45| I think cable TV is the entire committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=585)|
| 0:09:48| Everybody is on cable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=588)|
| 0:09:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=589)|
| 0:09:50| Then you will elect, you will state that to be true, get a vote on that to form the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=590)|
| 0:09:58| Go to the next committee, form the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=598)|
| 0:10:01| When we're through forming the committees, then you will recess this and call the chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=601)|
| 0:10:06| Then we'll call the cable committee into order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=606)|
| 0:10:09| The cable committee then will vote for a chairman and vice chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=609)|
| 0:10:13| and you will succeed through each committee at a time after that adjourns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=613)|
| 0:10:18| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=618)|
| 0:10:21| Last year we didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=621)|
| 0:10:22| It makes more sense to fill this sheet out first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=622)|
| 0:10:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=626)|
| 0:10:27| And then go committee by committee and then recess the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=627)|
| 0:10:31| And go by those committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=631)|
| 0:10:33| You've got to fill these out because you're going to recess four times if you don't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=633)|
| 0:10:36| So go ahead and fill out this form here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=636)|
| 0:10:38| We didn't recess last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=638)|
| 0:10:41| We just went from one committee to the other and elected them with our whole bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=641)|
| 0:10:45| But only the committee members can elect their officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=645)|
| 0:10:49| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=649)|
| 0:10:50| That's why you've got to be careful with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=650)|
| 0:10:51| So you have to make sure that each committee is called| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=651)|
| 0:10:54| and each person, you assign these committees first, and then you call off for each committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=654)|
| 0:11:00| That committee, the five on the court subcommittee, if you elect to have a subcommittee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=660)|
| 0:11:07| will elect their chairman and vice chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=667)|
| 0:11:10| The four on the insolvency board will elect their chairman and vice chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=670)|
| 0:11:13| and the five on the rules committee will elect their chairman and vice chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=673)|
| 0:11:17| The finance committee and the cable committee, the entire body, will elect their chairman and vice chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=677)|
| 0:11:22| So you start off by proclaiming the commission and read the names as the TV committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=682)|
| 0:11:31| and you get a vote approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=691)|
| 0:11:33| Question before we start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=693)|
| 0:11:35| You just brought up a good point there a minute ago, if we decide to have one, the court subcommittee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=695)|
| 0:11:41| Is that a requirement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=701)|
| 0:11:45| Not that I know of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=705)|
| 0:11:47| In the past, it was used to do the judicial commissioners or magistrates now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=707)|
| 0:11:54| It could still be used as a communication piece between the county courts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=714)|
| 0:11:59| which are your sessions court and your juvenile courts, for the judges to have somewhere to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=719)|
| 0:12:06| For example, if a court needed a service that is not in their budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=726)|
| 0:12:13| they then, instead of having to come to the whole commission, they could come to a committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=733)|
| 0:12:17| The committee could bring that forth to the commission or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=737)|
| 0:12:21| Say you needed a mental health service for drug court that they didn't have budgeted for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=741)|
| 0:12:29| then they could come to the court committee to address this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=749)|
| 0:12:34| and then have that chairman to bring it before the entire body and maybe do an appropriation or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=754)|
| 0:12:39| Well, to my knowledge, at least the last four years, we've not met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=759)|
| 0:12:44| There's been nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=764)|
| 0:12:45| Is that not a committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=765)|
| 0:12:47| If they have a problem, they could come to the chairman and he said, okay, next meeting I'll appoint a committee to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=767)|
| 0:12:53| He could do that and it would be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=773)|
| 0:12:55| But if you do that once, you can only do that once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=775)|
| 0:12:57| After then, it has to be a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=777)|
| 0:13:00| You see what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=780)|
| 0:13:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=781)|
| 0:13:04| Go ahead now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=784)|
| 0:13:06| It's the pleasure of this body, but it gets complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=786)|
| 0:13:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=792)|
| 0:13:13| For this resolution, we need to fill the spots designated for five committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=793)|
| 0:13:22| The cable TV committee is full commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=802)|
| 0:13:25| The finance committee is full commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=805)|
| 0:13:28| The court subcommittee is composed of five commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=808)|
| 0:13:36| I need volunteers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=816)|
| 0:13:39| I was on it last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=819)|
| 0:13:40| I'll be on it this year since we didn't meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=820)|
| 0:13:42| We did a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=822)|
| 0:13:45| You want last year's people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=825)|
| 0:13:48| The court subcommittee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=828)|
| 0:13:49| The last one was Broyles, Anders, Busler, Wright, and Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=829)|
| 0:14:02| I would like to have my name removed from that list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=842)|
| 0:14:06| Is there another volunteer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=846)|
| 0:14:09| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=849)|
| 0:14:10| I've got my light on, Dave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=850)|
| 0:14:13| I've got my light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=853)|
| 0:14:16| Commissioner Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=856)|
| 0:14:18| Thank you, Dave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=858)|
| 0:14:21| For the sake of diversity, I'm going to volunteer to serve on all the standing committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=861)|
| 0:14:33| Busler, Oynbee, and Broyles are the three volunteers so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=873)|
| 0:15:00| Two more names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=900)|
| 0:15:06| Brown and Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=906)|
| 0:15:18| Insolvency board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=918)|
| 0:15:21| I have Commissioner Broyles' name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=921)|
| 0:15:26| Commissioner Smith and Commissioner McKenzie were on that, along with Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=926)|
| 0:15:35| Two more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=935)|
| 0:15:37| Who do you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=937)|
| 0:15:39| Broyles and Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=939)|
| 0:15:41| Broyles and Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=941)|
| 0:15:51| We can re-nominate Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=951)|
| 0:15:56| If he's not here, put him on all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=956)|
| 0:15:59| One more volunteer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=959)|
| 0:16:01| That's the way it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=961)|
| 0:16:04| Snooze, you lose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=964)|

| 0:16:31| We're going to have to have a selection process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=991)|
| 0:16:41| Madam Clerk, read the names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=1001)|

| 0:17:13| and Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150901?start=1033)|
