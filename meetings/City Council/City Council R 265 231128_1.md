| 2:36:46| My name is Tanner Jessel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9406)|
| 2:36:47| I live at 1026 Olive Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9407)|
| 2:36:50| I'm here to oppose Ordinance 12A, to amend the code to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9410)|
| 2:36:56| transfer functions of animal control to Young-Williams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9416)|

| 2:37:17| That's true to an extent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9437)|
| 2:37:19| The Tennessee anti-rabies law contradicts this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9439)|
| 2:37:23| It specifically states a peace officer must| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9443)|

| 2:37:39| Emotions can run high, as we've seen tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9459)|
| 2:37:41| When we're talking about members of our families, pets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9461)|
| 2:37:43| often are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9463)|
| 2:37:44| In East Knoxville, we've had incidents of dogs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9464)|
| 2:37:49| attacking other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9469)|
| 2:37:50| In South Knoxville, Tommy, we had a recent incident of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9470)|
| 2:37:54| woman was mauled to death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9474)|
| 2:37:56| These are serious incidences where privatizing our animal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9476)|
| 2:38:00| control is not the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9480)|
| 2:38:03| These require the intervention and involvement of our police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9483)|
| 2:38:06| officers, and it sounds like we're losing eight sworn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9486)|
| 2:38:10| police officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9490)|

| 2:38:17| It sounds like maybe we're gaining some, but I want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9497)|

| 2:38:19| This is a big county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9499)|
| 2:38:20| We're going to be sharing these officers, these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9500)|
| 2:38:22| privatized for hire officers, with Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9502)|
| 2:38:26| Gwen, I want to remind you, in East Knoxville, we recently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9506)|
| 2:38:28| had a bear in Park Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9508)|
| 2:38:32| We need law enforcement to be involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9512)|
| 2:38:34| I think Chief Noel can comment on this, but I believe his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9514)|
| 2:38:37| officers are authorized to carry tranquilizers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9517)|

| 2:38:55| animal control officers with young Williams are going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9535)|
| 2:38:59| able to handle a bear, and certainly not if there are 11| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9539)|

| 2:39:08| My concern is not so much the loss of the officers, but the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9548)|
| 2:39:11| changing of the language within Chapter 5 that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9551)|

| 2:40:29| to ask Chief Noel about this, if this ordinance will take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9629)|
| 2:40:33| effect 17 days after passage, so sometime in January,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9633)|
| 2:40:36| assuming this passes tonight and goes on to a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9636)|
| 2:40:38| reading in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9638)|

| 2:40:45| uniform or a badge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9645)|
| 2:40:46| So I'm wondering, if this goes forward tonight, if this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9646)|
| 2:40:48| passes tonight and there's a second reading in January, are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9648)|
| 2:40:57| officers not going to be uniformed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9657)|
| 2:40:58| They're not going to have a badge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9658)|
| 2:41:00| This contract with Young-Williams does not take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9660)|
| 2:41:01| effect until April 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9661)|
| 2:41:03| So we're going to have four months where our officers are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9663)|
| 2:41:06| not authorized to display a badge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9666)|
| 2:41:09| So Lauren made a motion tonight to postpone this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9669)|
| 2:41:13| Let's postpone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9673)|
| 2:41:15| What's the rush?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9675)|
| 2:41:15| Why does this have to be done in December 2023?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9675)|
| 2:41:19| Charlie made a great comment that maybe we should study the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9679)|
| 2:41:22| item on the agenda earlier for a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9682)|
| 2:41:24| Let's do a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9684)|
| 2:41:26| There's no need to have this done tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9686)|
| 2:41:27| I think, Janet, based on your vote earlier, you did not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9687)|
| 2:41:30| participate in the earlier vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9690)|
| 2:41:34| Let's let the next council person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9694)|
| 2:41:36| participate in that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9696)|
| 2:41:37| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9697)|
| 2:41:38| And I want to comment that my comments, I discussed this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9698)|
| 2:41:41| with the Knoxville Animal Welfare Alliance, and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9701)|
| 2:41:42| share my concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9702)|

| 2:41:59| agreement with the county, passed unanimously on county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9719)|

| 2:42:04| It's supported by me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9724)|
| 2:42:05| It's supported by the police chief, the sheriff, the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9725)|
| 2:42:09| mayor, and the board of Young-Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9729)|
| 2:42:12| And my staff is here to answer any questions you might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9732)|
| 2:42:15| have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9735)|
| 2:42:18| I'm not sure whose light was on first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9738)|
| 2:42:19| Council member Smith, how about you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9739)|
| 2:42:22| I just wanted to ask a question about one of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9742)|
| 2:42:24| speaker's comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9744)|
| 2:42:27| What does happen, Chief Noel, if you're prepared to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9747)|
| 2:42:31| what does happen between when this goes into effect by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9751)|
| 2:42:38| ordinance and when Young-Williams takes over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9758)|
| 2:42:41| management of the services?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9761)|
| 2:42:43| The question was, what happens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9763)|
| 2:42:46| Assuming this passes, and in two more weeks it passes on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9766)|
| 2:42:49| second reading, it will be in effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9769)|
| 2:42:51| I believe it goes into actual effect in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9771)|
| 2:42:55| But I believe the contract doesn't start until April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9775)|
| 2:42:57| So what happens in between that window?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9777)|
| 2:42:58| The Knoxville Police Department will continue to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9778)|
| 2:43:01| provide these services, I believe, until April 1st, when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9781)|
| 2:43:04| Young-Williams will be stood up to be able to cover it from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9784)|
| 2:43:06| that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9786)|
| 2:43:06| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9786)|
| 2:43:08| And I just want to add, I'm not opposed to the fact that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9788)|
| 2:43:11| I'm not opposed to postponement for two weeks if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9791)|
| 2:43:14| Councilman Ryder wants to bring that back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9794)|
| 2:43:16| I'm open to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9796)|
| 2:43:17| And wants to study it more, I'm open to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9797)|
| 2:43:22| Council member Ryder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9802)|
| 2:43:25| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9805)|
| 2:43:26| So I was able this afternoon to speak with Doug Gordon and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9806)|
| 2:43:30| ask a couple of questions about some of the changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9810)|
| 2:43:32| specific to this agenda item, and got some answers that were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9812)|
| 2:43:38| satisfactory, but did not have time to go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9818)|
| 2:43:42| everything in light of many of the other things that were on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9822)|
| 2:43:45| the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9825)|
| 2:43:46| My apologies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9826)|
| 2:43:49| I'm not opposed to animal control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9829)|
| 2:43:51| moving to Young-Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9831)|
| 2:43:53| We voted on several items related to that earlier, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9833)|
| 2:43:56| voted in favor of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9836)|
| 2:43:58| If you turn to page, let's start with page 771 in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9838)|
| 2:44:03| packet, which is the section 5-3B2 part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9843)|
| 2:44:06| One of the questions I had to Doug Gordon was about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9846)|
| 2:44:10| section that talks about having the comptroller or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9850)|
| 2:44:12| representative investigate the records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9852)|
| 2:44:14| I asked him why that changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9854)|
| 2:44:18| Some of that language seems specific to maybe our old| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9858)|
| 2:44:20| structure, but the contract says anybody affiliated with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9860)|
| 2:44:25| the city or county can investigate the records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9865)|
| 2:44:27| So there were some specific reasons why this got changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9867)|
| 2:44:32| It doesn't necessarily mesh with the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9872)|
| 2:44:35| I just want to point that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9875)|
| 2:44:37| And I had some comments back to Doug, and he said, yeah, it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9877)|
| 2:44:39| could say that too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9879)|
| 2:44:40| So it just was a matter of having comments on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9880)|
| 2:44:44| The other comment that I have is, sorry, I'm trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9884)|
| 2:44:49| collect my thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9889)|
| 2:44:51| The contract goes into effect April 1st, 2024,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9891)|
| 2:44:57| something of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9897)|
| 2:44:59| This goes into effect 17 days after we pass it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9899)|
| 2:45:02| So if we pass it in December, this goes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9902)|
| 2:45:04| into effect in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9904)|
| 2:45:06| It changes all the language and the duties to the shelter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9906)|
| 2:45:08| but the shelter doesn't have the contract until April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9908)|
| 2:45:11| So there's a time discrepancy in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9911)|
| 2:45:14| And then on page 787 of our packet, the organization and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9914)|
| 2:45:18| duties of the Animal Control Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9918)|
| 2:45:20| So there's some changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9920)|
| 2:45:22| The police department doesn't have a representative on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9922)|
| 2:45:26| Animal Control Board anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9926)|
| 2:45:29| I'm not sure I wholeheartedly endorse that or agree with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9929)|
| 2:45:32| that, but that's the choice that was made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9932)|
| 2:45:34| in one to two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9934)|
| 2:45:35| I believe Deputy Chief Powell said he'd been working on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9935)|
| 2:45:38| for two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9938)|
| 2:45:41| So that changes it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9941)|
| 2:45:42| When you remove the city police department from it, you end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9942)|
| 2:45:45| up with two members of the public at large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9945)|
| 2:45:49| And you can see who the representatives are is listed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9949)|
| 2:45:54| in the paragraph, and then down below when they were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9954)|
| 2:45:56| originally initiated, which is apparently 1981-ish or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9956)|
| 2:46:00| somewhere thereabouts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9960)|
| 2:46:02| Anyway, I want to point out that the Animal Control Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9962)|
| 2:46:06| has been described in previous agenda items as an advisory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9966)|
| 2:46:09| board now, or an appeal board rather than an advisory board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9969)|
| 2:46:15| And Knox County Humane Society and Animal Shelter is Young| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9975)|
| 2:46:20| Williams, and that's defined on page 789.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9980)|
| 2:46:24| So the Animal Shelter, based on the stuff that we've passed in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9984)|
| 2:46:29| this agenda, is the deciding authority, not the Animal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9989)|
| 2:46:32| Control Unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9992)|
| 2:46:34| But to appeal your decisions of anything done by that, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9994)|
| 2:46:38| this is not personal about the current leadership or Young| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=9998)|
| 2:46:41| Williams, I'm just talking about, let's talk about how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10001)|
| 2:46:43| this is structured and how decisions are made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10003)|
| 2:46:45| So I want to be very, very clear, this is not personal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10005)|
| 2:46:51| If the shelter or shelter employee makes a decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10011)|
| 2:46:55| it's appealed to the Animal Control Board, and the Animal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10015)|
| 2:46:58| Control Board is made up of representatives from these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10018)|
| 2:47:01| entities, in addition to one of those representatives is from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10021)|
| 2:47:06| Young Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10026)|
| 2:47:07| So I just have to say, should we question and wonder why they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10027)|
| 2:47:13| would also be able to be part of that board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10033)|
| 2:47:15| And again, nothing personal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10035)|
| 2:47:17| Janet, you're the director, Councilwoman Tesserman, you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10037)|
| 2:47:21| the director of the shelter right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10041)|
| 2:47:23| You're also an at-large member of the Animal Control Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10043)|
| 2:47:26| and you're also the chair of the Animal Control Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10046)|
| 2:47:29| So there's a lot of, you have a voice in the appeal process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10049)|
| 2:47:34| going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10054)|
| 2:47:36| There's nothing that says how the chair is, it says how the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10056)|
| 2:47:40| board picks out its chair, but it doesn't declare that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10060)|
| 2:47:44| chair shouldn't be somebody who's the staff of the shelter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10064)|
| 2:47:47| that might be appealed, your decisions might be appealed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10067)|
| 2:47:50| So I think there's some conflicts there in how it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10070)|
| 2:47:52| organized, and those are where my questions lie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10072)|
| 2:47:55| And I did not get to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10075)|
| 2:47:57| And I'm going to run out of time, so I want to get all my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10077)|
| 2:48:00| questions out into the air, if I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10080)|
| 2:48:04| So it's kind of about the makeup of the board that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10084)|
| 2:48:07| going to get the appeals of any of the decisions of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10087)|
| 2:48:09| staff of the shelter, the director of the shelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10089)|
| 2:48:15| And the other thing, I've brought this up multiple times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10095)|
| 2:48:19| with other issues that we've had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10099)|
| 2:48:21| The minutes are not public, and the meetings, if you go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10101)|
| 2:48:29| Animal Control Board on the city website, it says when the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10109)|
| 2:48:31| meetings occur, but the minutes are not publicly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10111)|
| 2:48:34| noticed, the minutes are not open to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10114)|
| 2:48:36| It's not an open public process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10116)|
| 2:48:39| And I've asked before for the minutes of the meeting, as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10119)|
| 2:48:43| well as the agendas of the meeting to be publicly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10123)|
| 2:48:45| noticed, and that is also not constituted in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10125)|
| 2:48:47| So I'm just asking for some balance and some oversight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10127)|
| 2:48:52| because what we're saying is, here's the contract, here's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10132)|
| 2:48:55| the money, you run the board now, you staff the board, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10135)|
| 2:48:58| chair the board, or one does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10138)|
| 2:49:01| Council Member Ryder, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10141)|
| 2:49:03| I'm sure if you have more questions, we can come back to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10143)|
| 2:49:05| you later in the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10145)|
| 2:49:07| Council Member Testerman, would you respond to those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10147)|
| 2:49:10| please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10150)|
| 2:49:11| Yeah, just to clarify, again, back to the board, I am the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10151)|
| 2:49:17| representative for Young-Williams, opposed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10157)|
| 2:49:19| being a large member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10159)|
| 2:49:22| I'm not opposed to the police department still having a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10162)|
| 2:49:25| representative, but does it make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10165)|
| 2:49:29| I mean, you've got different disciplines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10169)|
| 2:49:32| And Young-Williams is the animal welfare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10172)|
| 2:49:39| expert in that space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10179)|
| 2:49:42| But you also have a member from the zoo, the health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10182)|
| 2:49:45| department, all of those coming together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10185)|
| 2:49:47| I guess I go back to the appeal process in that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10187)|
| 2:49:52| haven't experienced in seven years of the board an appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10192)|
| 2:49:55| It's really been a permit approval process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10195)|
| 2:50:01| And as far as any animal welfare violations, those are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10201)|
| 2:50:06| appealed in city court when it comes to any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10206)|
| 2:50:08| citations that are issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10208)|
| 2:50:10| So for instance, if you look at the permits, it's just a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10210)|
| 2:50:19| matter of those individuals coming into compliance if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10219)|
| 2:50:23| they have too many hens for their space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10223)|
| 2:50:25| So I mean, that's where animal control duties currently are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10225)|
| 2:50:29| is doing those site inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10229)|
| 2:50:31| So it's just in the same form as any other coming into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10231)|
| 2:50:37| compliance with a local ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10237)|
| 2:50:40| Per the minutes, et cetera, we do have the minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10240)|
| 2:50:47| Being staffed and not really, I mean, some of them need to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10247)|
| 2:50:51| scribed, but we do have minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10251)|
| 2:50:54| And they are documented, so there is that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10254)|
| 2:50:59| So I don't know that having a representative from Young-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10259)|
| 2:51:03| Williams, whether it's me or a member of our team, I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10263)|
| 2:51:09| feel like there's a conflict, because there's six other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10269)|
| 2:51:11| members on there who make up that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10271)|
| 2:51:15| So because we do bring that expertise in the space, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10275)|
| 2:51:20| mean, from an animal standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10280)|
| 2:51:22| So I don't know if I've clarified your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10282)|
| 2:51:27| questions on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10287)|
| 2:51:29| We can go to the next person with their light on and come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10289)|
| 2:51:31| back as needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10291)|
| 2:51:32| Council Member McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10292)|
| 2:51:37| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10297)|
| 2:51:38| Councilwoman Ryder actually expressed some of the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10298)|
| 2:51:40| that I had that I wanted to speak to, but then I also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10300)|
| 2:51:44| wanted to, for Mr. Jessel, let him know that I absolutely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10304)|
| 2:51:48| understand about the bear, because there was one in my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10308)|
| 2:51:50| yard and in my trash can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10310)|
| 2:51:52| So I think I was referred to TWRA on that call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10312)|
| 2:51:56| But I'd like to give my time back to Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10316)|
| 2:52:00| Are you good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10320)|
| 2:52:00| You got yours back on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10320)|
| 2:52:02| But again, I do share some of those concerns, especially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10322)|
| 2:52:04| with the oversight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10324)|
| 2:52:07| Having one person in so many positions of power on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10327)|
| 2:52:11| board, even though there are six additional members, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10331)|
| 2:52:14| think we may want to just kind of look at that a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10334)|
| 2:52:16| more closely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10336)|
| 2:52:17| And there was one item in here, and I've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10337)|
| 2:52:20| to find it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10340)|
| 2:52:21| But it was related to vicious dogs, and that there could be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10341)|
| 2:52:27| a license given to someone, a certain level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10347)|
| 2:52:32| OK, here it is, on page 773, section 5-11, it shall be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10352)|
| 2:52:40| unlawful for any person to own, keep, have charge of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10360)|
| 2:52:43| shelter, feed, harbor, or take care of any vicious animal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10363)|
| 2:52:46| within the city limits unless a special permit is issued by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10366)|
| 2:52:50| the animal shelter wherein the owner assumes full| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10370)|
| 2:52:52| responsibility and liabilities of the ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10372)|
| 2:52:54| Could you expound on that a little bit, as to what would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10374)|
| 2:52:57| be the circumstances the dog has been designated as vicious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10377)|
| 2:53:01| that a permit would be issued, a special| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10381)|
| 2:53:04| permit would be issued?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10384)|
| 2:53:06| From that verbiage, I would say there are levels of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10386)|
| 2:53:10| dangerous dog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10390)|
| 2:53:11| Dangerous dog level one, dangerous dog level two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10391)|
| 2:53:15| We have never adopted out a dangerous dog level two dog| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10395)|
| 2:53:21| that's come in at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10401)|
| 2:53:23| Dangerous dog level one, if it comes out, and if it's given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10403)|
| 2:53:29| back to the owner, or generally that's the case, if a dog is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10409)|
| 2:53:34| not surrendered to the shelter, they go to the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10414)|
| 2:53:37| The court allows them to take back a dog that's been deemed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10417)|
| 2:53:41| dangerous dog level one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10421)|

| 2:53:51| keeping of that animal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10431)|
| 2:53:54| Would vicious be determined by the number of bites or attacks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10434)|
| 2:53:57| or something that that animal has had?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10437)|
| 2:54:00| Not necessarily on the number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10440)|
| 2:54:02| It would be if it has a bite on its record, or if it's a repeat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10442)|
| 2:54:09| escape artist, and might not bite, but terrorize neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10449)|
| 2:54:14| and that type of thing, then there are provisions that that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10454)|
| 2:54:17| dog cannot be outside a fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10457)|
| 2:54:21| There's a lot of security measures that come into play,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10461)|
| 2:54:26| which is very rare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10466)|
| 2:54:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10467)|
| 2:54:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10470)|
| 2:54:31| Council Member Ryder, just as a point of information, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10471)|
| 2:54:34| didn't know that the minutes of the Animal Control Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10474)|
| 2:54:38| weren't available online, but I will try to remedy that as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10478)|
| 2:54:42| soon as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10482)|
| 2:54:46| The agendas and the minutes, there's no reason why we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10486)|
| 2:54:49| shouldn't be posting those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10489)|
| 2:54:50| I just wasn't aware of that, so we'll fix that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10490)|
| 2:54:55| Council Member Parker, and then we can go back to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10495)|
| 2:54:57| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10497)|
| 2:55:01| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10501)|
| 2:55:04| When it was proposed to postpone this item at the top| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10504)|
| 2:55:08| of our agenda, I missed that motion, or I would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10508)|
| 2:55:13| supported it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10513)|
| 2:55:15| And I support postponement now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10515)|
| 2:55:17| The issues that are being raised, I think, are valid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10517)|
| 2:55:21| concerns, and they're not necessarily being raised as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10521)|
| 2:55:24| amendments to this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10524)|
| 2:55:26| I think there's more discussion and clarification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10526)|
| 2:55:29| that is needed, so I would support a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10529)|
| 2:55:33| I'll allow someone else to make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10533)|
| 2:55:38| OK, Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10538)|
| 2:55:42| So my comment is, I don't want to vote against this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10542)|
| 2:55:45| because this is necessary to go with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10545)|
| 2:55:48| contract to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10548)|
| 2:55:50| But I'm also not prepared to say, unless you guys want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10550)|
| 2:55:53| sit here and debate it and ask staff all kinds of which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10553)|
| 2:55:57| ways of Sunday, how to sit here and edit the board part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10557)|
| 2:56:04| I would rather talk with staff in the next two weeks and see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10564)|
| 2:56:09| what changes would be recommended for the makeup of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10569)|
| 2:56:12| the board, or changes to it, or why KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10572)|
| 2:56:17| I understand why KPD might be removing themselves from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10577)|
| 2:56:20| the Animal Control Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10580)|
| 2:56:22| But also, when we were talking about the earlier agenda items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10582)|
| 2:56:25| Chief Noel was talking about the various reasons that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10585)|
| 2:56:28| would go out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10588)|
| 2:56:29| And so I realize a lot of what you're doing on the Animal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10589)|
| 2:56:33| Control Board in the future is permitting, but there's also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10593)|
| 2:56:36| stuff, I guess some of the things that the board used to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10596)|
| 2:56:41| do with Dangerous Dog, or not Dangerous Dog, there's some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10601)|
| 2:56:44| things that used to be done with the board that's now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10604)|
| 2:56:46| moving to the staff of Young-Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10606)|
| 2:56:51| That would only be the oversight of permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10611)|
| 2:56:54| The oversight of permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10614)|
| 2:56:55| So the Animal Control Board, describe to us what Animal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10615)|
| 2:57:01| Control Board's going to be doing in the future, in your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10621)|
| 2:57:05| understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10625)|
| 2:57:06| Well, I mean, I think, and I would like to bring Mr. Gordon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10626)|
| 2:57:11| up to help with this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10631)|
| 2:57:14| But with that, I think any, for instance, like I said, we, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10634)|
| 2:57:22| board itself has been working over the last couple of years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10642)|
| 2:57:25| to establish standards and guidelines, much like the health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10645)|
| 2:57:28| department does with restaurants for local pet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10648)|
| 2:57:31| retailers, because currently there have never been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10651)|
| 2:57:36| So we've, this group has worked with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10656)|
| 2:57:38| It would be something ultimately that would come to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10658)|
| 2:57:40| council to establish those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10660)|
| 2:57:45| Although I think some of that is under the purview of what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10665)|
| 2:57:49| Animal Control Board can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10669)|
| 2:57:52| Other than that, one thing that came up recently, which needs to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10672)|
| 2:57:58| be consulted with legal about, is that there was an individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10678)|
| 2:58:01| that came to the board, and it is noticed, and people do show| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10681)|
| 2:58:05| up from time to time to talk about different issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10685)|
| 2:58:10| For instance, in the city, you can only have a goat for 90 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10690)|
| 2:58:13| to graze, but somebody came to us who has a goat or wants a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10693)|
| 2:58:17| goat as a comfort animal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10697)|
| 2:58:20| So we have to go through a process of, you know, getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10700)|
| 2:58:23| clinical recommendations and those types of things to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10703)|
| 2:58:26| approve from a legality standpoint, to determine if the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10706)|
| 2:58:31| board approves such things, but 95% plus of what we do is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10711)|
| 2:58:38| approve permits on a regular basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10718)|
| 2:58:41| Four times a year we're mandated to meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10721)|
| 2:58:43| Occasionally we'll call a meeting if there are a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10723)|
| 2:58:45| permits or exhibitions that have come up, like Mardi Gras, for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10725)|
| 2:58:49| instance, or Bark in the Park, that we have to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10729)|
| 2:58:52| But Mr. Goren, would you like to weigh in on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10732)|
| 2:58:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10735)|
| 2:58:57| So the board is only supposed to meet four times a year per the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10737)|
| 2:59:01| ordinance, but in reality it has to meet many, many times of year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10741)|
| 2:59:05| on an emergency basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10745)|
| 2:59:08| Anybody who wants to come to the city of Knoxville and get a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10748)|
| 2:59:11| permit for this or that typically goes to a counter and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10751)|
| 2:59:16| they fill out a form, they pay a permit application, and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10756)|
| 2:59:19| get their permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10759)|
| 2:59:20| That's not true with any of these animal control permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10760)|
| 2:59:24| We have a Byzantine system where you have to contact the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10764)|
| 2:59:28| animal control unit, you should have downloaded your form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10768)|
| 2:59:32| online, printed it out, filled it out yourself, make an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10772)|
| 2:59:36| appointment to see an animal control unit member, pay that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10776)|
| 2:59:41| fee and deliver the permit application to the unit member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10781)|
| 2:59:43| The unit's head then takes these to the animal control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10783)|
| 2:59:48| board, the permit applications are passed around, each one is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10788)|
| 2:59:51| read, the permits are discussed, and I would say 99| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10791)|
| 3:00:01| out of 100 times all of these permits are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10801)|
| 3:00:04| non-discretionary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10804)|
| 3:00:06| It's just a matter of did they fill out the form correctly and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10806)|
| 3:00:09| did they pay the fee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10809)|
| 3:00:10| So now this Byzantine system results in a lot of problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10810)|
| 3:00:17| for the citizens of Knoxville who need these animal permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10817)|
| 3:00:20| Let's say there's a church out there and they want to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10820)|
| 3:00:25| their Christmas pageant and they've rented out some goats| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10825)|
| 3:00:29| and some sheep and some camels, they may not realize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10829)|
| 3:00:34| that they're going to have to put in that application for an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10834)|
| 3:00:39| animal exhibition well in advance of that show in order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10839)|
| 3:00:45| to have everything collected and taken to the animal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10845)|
| 3:00:49| control board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10849)|
| 3:00:51| It's just a bad system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10851)|
| 3:00:56| And since we're switching the animal control unit to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10856)|
| 3:01:03| something that Young-Williams does, the animal control unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10863)|
| 3:01:07| and the animal control board are mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10867)|
| 3:01:11| throughout Chapter 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10871)|
| 3:01:13| And to make all of this work, it seemed like let's just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10873)|
| 3:01:18| bring the animal control board and this process up to date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10878)|
| 3:01:24| and make it something efficient for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10884)|
| 3:01:26| citizens of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10886)|
| 3:01:28| I just want to mention real quick, when it comes to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10888)|
| 3:01:31| bear issue, animal control unit officers currently do not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10891)|
| 3:01:37| have weapons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10897)|
| 3:01:38| They couldn't shoot a bear if they wanted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10898)|
| 3:01:41| That was a KPD function, if it ever would come up, and it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10901)|
| 3:01:46| will remain so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10906)|
| 3:01:47| So no, Young-Williams animal welfare officers will not be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10907)|
| 3:01:53| issued weapons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10913)|
| 3:01:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10917)|
| 3:01:57| Council Member Fugitt, and we can come back to you, Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10917)|
| 3:02:00| Member Ryder, if you have more questions after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10920)|
| 3:02:03| Council Member Fugitt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10923)|
| 3:02:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10924)|
| 3:02:04| I think you just answered my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10924)|
| 3:02:06| I'm just trying to get the sense that basically what I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10926)|
| 3:02:09| heard is KPD civilian were animal welfare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10929)|
| 3:02:16| officers, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10936)|
| 3:02:19| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10939)|
| 3:02:21| These are going to be civilian animal control officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10941)|
| 3:02:26| working for Young-Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10946)|
| 3:02:28| If either one of those people, whether they work for KPD or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10948)|
| 3:02:32| work for Young-Williams, thought they needed police for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10952)|
| 3:02:37| a dangerous situation, they would call, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10957)|
| 3:02:40| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10960)|
| 3:02:41| And KPD would show up in its law enforcement capacity to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10961)|
| 3:02:45| deal with upset owners, bears, bad things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10965)|
| 3:02:52| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10972)|
| 3:02:53| And so that would not change the current practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10973)|
| 3:02:57| I don't know what the words are, but the practice will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10977)|
| 3:03:00| remain the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10980)|
| 3:03:01| Am I understanding that correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10981)|
| 3:03:03| Because that's what I thought I understood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10983)|
| 3:03:05| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10985)|
| 3:03:06| OK, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10986)|
| 3:03:09| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10989)|
| 3:03:10| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10990)|
| 3:03:12| So I'm going to go back to my point, which is, so in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10992)|
| 3:03:18| ordinance that we're voting on with some changes, the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=10998)|
| 3:03:23| shall be charged with the responsibility to recommend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11003)|
| 3:03:26| goals and objections for the animal shelter, which is now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11006)|
| 3:03:30| providing control as well as intake of animals and care of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11010)|
| 3:03:35| them, among many other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11015)|
| 3:03:37| Recommend qualification requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11017)|
| 3:03:39| Recommend specialized training courses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11019)|
| 3:03:42| Review annual continuing education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11022)|
| 3:03:44| Review appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11024)|
| 3:03:46| Establish minimum standards for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11026)|
| 3:03:49| operation of the kennel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11029)|
| 3:03:52| I won't go through all of it, because what I'm going to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11032)|
| 3:03:55| is I'm going to make a motion to postpone for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11035)|
| 3:03:57| I don't think we need to postpone longer than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11037)|
| 3:04:00| If it's ironed out and it gets passed on emergency the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11040)|
| 3:04:03| time, fine by me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11043)|
| 3:04:05| I just don't want to sit here on the fly and say, let's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11045)|
| 3:04:08| edit it this way or let's edit it that way, because that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11048)|
| 3:04:11| not what I think needs to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11051)|
| 3:04:15| I think that the body that's hearing appeals, we have Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11055)|
| 3:04:19| of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11059)|
| 3:04:21| We have five people who are board members of Board of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11061)|
| 3:04:25| Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11065)|
| 3:04:27| And you have staff that are experts in their area, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11067)|
| 3:04:31| don't deny that you know a lot about animal care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11071)|
| 3:04:33| I do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11073)|
| 3:04:34| You can talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11074)|
| 3:04:35| I cannot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11075)|
| 3:04:37| I don't deny that at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11077)|
| 3:04:38| I don't deny your experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11078)|
| 3:04:40| What I'm saying is you can't be in multiple roles, or one who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11080)|
| 3:04:45| runs the animal shelter and the services and the staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11085)|
| 3:04:47| shouldn't be in multiple roles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11087)|
| 3:04:49| So I just want to make sure that our animal control board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11089)|
| 3:04:53| is lined up as it should be and in the best order that it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11093)|
| 3:04:56| should be while we're changing this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11096)|
| 3:04:59| So I'm not going to take up the full three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11099)|
| 3:05:02| I will go meet with Mr. Gordon or with Deputy Chief Powell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11102)|
| 3:05:07| who offered to assist me with this, and be like, hey, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11107)|
| 3:05:10| tell me why you don't think you should have somebody as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11110)|
| 3:05:12| one of the representatives, and we should make it an at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11112)|
| 3:05:14| large member of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11114)|
| 3:05:17| I think the role should be the animal shelter as the experts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11117)|
| 3:05:22| gives their opinions, recommendations, statements on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11122)|
| 3:05:26| the appeals, and policies, and qualification, and training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11126)|
| 3:05:29| materials to the animal control board members, just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11129)|
| 3:05:32| like BZA, and then the board members vote on it, just like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11132)|
| 3:05:37| BZA is structured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11137)|
| 3:05:39| So without any further deliberation on that tonight, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11139)|
| 3:05:43| will make a motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11143)|
| 3:05:46| A motion to postpone for two weeks has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11146)|
| 3:05:49| been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11149)|
| 3:05:53| Just a question, a point of information, Mr. Gordon, can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11153)|
| 3:05:58| you just help council members understand if there's a change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11158)|
| 3:06:03| to item 12A, either tonight or in a future meeting, would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11163)|
| 3:06:09| that affect the agreements that have been already adopted by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11169)|
| 3:06:12| county commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11172)|
| 3:06:13| Would that have to go back to them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11173)|
| 3:06:15| Or can you just explain that to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11175)|
| 3:06:20| No, I don't think it would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11180)|
| 3:06:25| The county commission, the agreement we have from county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11185)|
| 3:06:28| commission does not go into effect until April 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11188)|
| 3:06:31| And I think what we're talking about is what does the animal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11191)|
| 3:06:37| control board do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11197)|
| 3:06:38| How do they function?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11198)|
| 3:06:40| How do permits get applied?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11200)|
| 3:06:44| None of that is of concern to the county because the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11204)|
| 3:06:47| does not have an animal control board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11207)|
| 3:06:49| And I discussed it with several of their folks, and they were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11209)|
| 3:06:54| not interested in establishing one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11214)|
| 3:06:56| OK, good to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11216)|
| 3:06:57| I'm sorry to interrupt the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11217)|
| 3:07:00| I just wanted to make sure I understood that and hopefully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11220)|
| 3:07:03| clarify this for you all too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11223)|
| 3:07:04| Council Member Thomas, the motion on the floor is to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11224)|
| 3:07:06| postpone for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11226)|
| 3:07:08| Questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11228)|
| 3:07:09| Yes, that was good information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11229)|
| 3:07:11| You need to put your microphone on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11231)|
| 3:07:14| I'm trainable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11234)|
| 3:07:17| Council Member Ryder has done a lot of work on this, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11237)|
| 3:07:22| think it's all very sincere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11242)|
| 3:07:23| And I don't take her comments at all as being critical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11243)|
| 3:07:27| I think it's really well-founded in some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11247)|
| 3:07:32| questions she's got and also trying to make some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11252)|
| 3:07:37| adjustments and make it better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11257)|
| 3:07:39| I can't imagine that I'm going to oppose this at any time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11259)|
| 3:07:43| but I would be agreeable to a two-week postponement to try| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11263)|
| 3:07:49| to answer questions and possibly make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11269)|
| 3:07:54| this ordinance better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11274)|
| 3:07:55| And unless someone can show me some irreparable harm in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11275)|
| 3:07:59| doing so, I would be in favor of a two-week postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11279)|
| 3:08:05| Council Member Fugitt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11285)|
| 3:08:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11287)|
| 3:08:08| My question was, if this is not passed in December and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11288)|
| 3:08:13| agreement goes, we could approve it on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11293)|
| 3:08:17| emergency ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11297)|
| 3:08:18| I heard Council Member Ryder saying that that's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11298)|
| 3:08:20| possibility and get this done in December before the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11300)|
| 3:08:24| agreement takes place in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11304)|
| 3:08:26| My question is, if the agreement takes place, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11306)|
| 3:08:30| ordinance doesn't have any impact on the agreement that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11310)|
| 3:08:35| we've made with the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11315)|
| 3:08:37| Mr. Gordon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11317)|
| 3:08:40| I mean, if we're transferring everything, the contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11320)|
| 3:08:43| starts January and the stuff gets activated in April, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11323)|

| 3:09:58| Yes, just for context, quite often| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11398)|
| 3:10:00| we object to these rezonings that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11400)|
| 3:10:05| are kind of extreme on paper, like RN1 to RN5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11405)|
| 3:10:10| like here, as we should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11410)|
| 3:10:12| This one, I've scrutinized it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11412)|
| 3:10:14| The planning staff has scrutinized it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11414)|
| 3:10:17| We agree that on this particular parcel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11417)|
| 3:10:21| that rezoning is appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11421)|
| 3:10:23| And I can go into other reasons, but it basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11423)|
| 3:10:26| has to do with the location, the access to some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11426)|
| 3:10:29| of the infrastructure there, some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11429)|
| 3:10:30| of their surrounding zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11430)|
| 3:10:32| This is not a huge parcel, and I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11432)|
| 3:10:34| it would be one of the better places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11434)|
| 3:10:36| to add density relatively inside of a neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11436)|
| 3:10:40| So I do agree with this rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11440)|

| 3:14:29| I don't have that much time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11669)|
| 3:14:35| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11675)|
| 3:14:36| My name's Alexis Gibson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11676)|
| 3:14:37| I live at 37909.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11677)|
| 3:14:40| Y'all saw me here last time because I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11680)|
| 3:14:43| was the one who reprised Horton Hears a Who.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11683)|
| 3:14:46| The reason I did that is because I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11686)|
| 3:14:48| am a graduate of the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11688)|
| 3:14:50| I graduated from the Chancellor's Honors Program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11690)|
| 3:14:53| in the theater department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11693)|
| 3:14:55| I have a continuing education certification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11695)|
| 3:14:58| and user experience and user interface design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11698)|
| 3:15:02| One of the things that it teaches us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11702)|
| 3:15:04| is that the average American has an education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11704)|
| 3:15:08| level of sixth to eighth grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11708)|
| 3:15:11| I also know that we are a city of music, a city of rhythm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11711)|
| 3:15:15| So I thought I could possibly move your hearts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11715)|
| 3:15:18| with the thoughts of, these are people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11718)|
| 3:15:22| I come to you today because, as you can see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11722)|
| 3:15:26| I am wearing a watermelon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11726)|
| 3:15:28| It says in French, this is not a watermelon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11728)|
| 3:15:32| I'm here to let you all know that if you are not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11732)|
| 3:15:35| looking at social media, I mean, X, Twitter, TikTok, Snapchat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11735)|
| 3:15:41| WhatsApp, Facebook, what's another one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11741)|
| 3:15:44| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11744)|
| 3:15:45| If you do not know how to use these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11745)|
| 3:15:50| if you mock them saying, oh, it's Chinese media,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11750)|
| 3:15:54| it is influencing people, you are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11754)|
| 3:15:57| discriminating against your constituents in a crazy way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11757)|
| 3:16:02| because what the media is doing is skewing a narrative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11762)|
| 3:16:07| I don't think you all are bad people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11767)|
| 3:16:10| I don't think the people on either side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11770)|
| 3:16:11| are bad people because, in the end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11771)|
| 3:16:14| everybody is trying to do what's in their hearts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11774)|
| 3:16:18| I truly don't think there really are that many people who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11778)|
| 3:16:21| are evil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11781)|
| 3:16:22| And if they are, usually you can find out why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11782)|
| 3:16:26| I'm speaking to you today because, one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11786)|
| 3:16:29| I don't know if you all know what white phosphorus does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11789)|
| 3:16:33| It was originally introduced in the military| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11793)|
| 3:16:36| so that you could use it as a gas to melt down weapons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11796)|
| 3:16:39| so that they would be no longer usable for any military| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11799)|
| 3:16:42| to use after you if you could not transport them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11802)|
| 3:16:46| I repeat, they were made to melt weapons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11806)|
| 3:16:51| If you want to see a pretty accurate example of what it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11811)|
| 3:16:54| does, but you don't have the courage to actually look up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11814)|
| 3:16:58| what it does, the mask of the Red Death episode| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11818)|
| 3:17:03| from Fall of the House of Usher is on Netflix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11823)|
| 3:17:06| It's like the first episode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11826)|
| 3:17:08| It's a great example for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11828)|
| 3:17:11| I am not here to condemn Hamas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11831)|
| 3:17:15| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11835)|
| 3:17:16| I am not here to condemn Palestine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11836)|
| 3:17:20| which is conflated with Hamas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11840)|
| 3:17:22| But I am here because I want to remind everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11842)|
| 3:17:25| of some things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11845)|

| 3:17:36| be kept high and impregnable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11856)|
| 3:17:40| We discussed some human resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11860)|
| 3:17:43| I work in technology for HRIS systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11863)|
| 3:17:47| I work in operations now for employee benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11867)|
| 3:17:51| So I've been doing that for about four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11871)|
| 3:17:54| Something that's bothered me is that according| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11874)|
| 3:17:59| to the Office of Special Counsel and the Merit Systems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11879)|

| 3:18:33| There's also a concept called implicit and anchor bias.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11913)|
| 3:18:37| Implicit bias is where you do not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11917)|
| 3:18:39| realize that you have a skewed opinion of another person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11919)|

| 3:18:47| that you are ever presented with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11927)|
| 3:18:48| is the view you are firmly held.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11928)|
| 3:18:52| In my last few seconds, I want to let people know that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11932)|
| 3:18:54| am from Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11934)|

| 3:19:03| but I'm not name dropping because I believe in ethics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11943)|
| 3:19:07| I am concerned because one, when I looked up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11947)|
| 3:19:11| what other religious communities you visited,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=11951)|

| 3:20:47| I love Knoxville, and I've always called it home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=12047)|
| 3:20:51| But Knoxville doesn't seem to care about me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=12051)|

| 3:22:07| beings with dreams and goals and who have families that love and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=12127)|

| 3:22:24| And I would talk to my cousins,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=12144)|
| 3:22:26| and they would tell me how they would love to come to the lands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=12146)|
| 3:22:28| of opportunity and pursue their dreams here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=12148)|

| 3:23:01| For Israel to kill over 20,000 people is not an act of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=12181)|
| 3:23:03| warfare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=12183)|
| 3:23:05| It is an act of genocide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=12185)|

| 3:25:43| civilians when you bombed Dresden and other cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=12343)|
| 3:25:47| That notion was wholly rejected by the Nuremberg court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=12347)|
| 3:25:50| The notion that the deliberate and purposeful killings of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=12350)|
| 3:25:53| civilians was equal to the undesired, unintended, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=12353)|

| 3:26:15| completely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=12375)|
| 3:26:17| And why call for a ceasefire instead of Hamas to surrender?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231128?start=12377)|
