| 0:04:16| developing it into any type of multiple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=256)|
| 0:04:20| lot situation. It's our intent to build a single| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=260)|

| 0:04:48| that we can also do some things on the property, such as having beehives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=288)|

| 0:09:08| I have a motion by Commissioner Hill and a second by Commissioner Busler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=548)|
| 0:09:12| to approve the Sector Plan amendment. Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=552)|

| 0:09:20| Sir, if you'll hang right there, we've got one more. Madam Clerk, please| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=560)|

| 0:09:28| item as well, if you'll stay close to the podium there. This is item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=568)|
| 0:09:32| 11-H-21-RZ. It's also a request of Steve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=572)|

| 0:09:48| Thank you, Madam Clerk. We just approved the Sector Plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=588)|

| 0:10:28| Ms. Brooks, because it was a split vote, basically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=628)|
| 0:10:32| the staff had recommended two units per acre, and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=632)|
| 0:10:36| Commissioner Smith made a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=636)|
| 0:10:40| for three. What was some of the discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=640)|
| 0:10:44| of why, you know, to support the staff recommendation of two dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=644)|
| 0:10:48| per acre? That's a good question, Commissioner. I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=648)|
| 0:10:52| that it was Commissioner Roth who made the motion, and I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=652)|
| 0:10:56| Commissioner Smith made a comment as well in support, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=656)|
| 0:11:00| when the vote was taken, and then a planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=660)|
| 0:11:04| commissioner, another planning commissioner, Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=664)|
| 0:11:08| you know, said he wanted to hear the discussion, but when they did the vote, there was no discussion on the other side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=668)|
| 0:11:12| of those voting against it. So I don't really have much to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=672)|
| 0:11:16| offer. I apologize, but I did go back and look at it again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=676)|
| 0:11:20| watch it again. There was no real discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=680)|
| 0:11:24| And what was the main reason the staff wanted two? Because it's consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=684)|
| 0:11:28| with the surrounding density, and it's consistent with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=688)|
| 0:11:32| recommendation that staff had put forth when the request came| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=692)|
| 0:11:36| before you, I believe in the summer. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=696)|
| 0:11:40| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=700)|
| 0:11:44| Are there any other comments or questions from the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=704)|
| 0:11:48| Chair will look to District 6. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=708)|
| 0:11:52| I do have, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=712)|
| 0:11:56| watched this also, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=716)|
| 0:12:00| I noticed in the initial recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=720)|
| 0:12:04| of two per acre, one of the reasons it did that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=724)|
| 0:12:08| because everything around it is still agriculture, or to one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=728)|
| 0:12:12| side is also a two per acre. And then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=732)|
| 0:12:16| I did watch, what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=736)|
| 0:12:20| concerns me about this is it says it allows the builder to increase amenities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=740)|
| 0:12:24| but there's nothing in there that makes you do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=744)|
| 0:12:28| you know. Could you talk to me a little bit about what your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=748)|
| 0:12:32| plan might be on that property? I can. It's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=752)|
| 0:12:36| small track. It's 10.66 acres. At| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=756)|
| 0:12:40| two units per acre, it's not a viable project. You would actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=760)|
| 0:12:44| lose money on it. At three units per acre, you can make this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=764)|
| 0:12:48| pencil. And again, the need is high in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=768)|
| 0:12:52| area for additional housing. Well, I understand the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=772)|
| 0:12:56| need being high. Believe me, I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=776)|
| 0:13:00| But my concern is that, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=780)|
| 0:13:04| and it actually lays pretty good, doesn't it? It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=784)|
| 0:13:08| There's a hilly area in the back. Yeah. Is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=788)|
| 0:13:12| you're saying you're going to put more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=792)|
| 0:13:16| units on it, and then if you do that, you will include amenities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=796)|
| 0:13:20| like what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=800)|
| 0:13:24| Well, whatever's required. Nothing's required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=804)|
| 0:13:28| Probably the most that we can get in this subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=808)|
| 0:13:32| is 24 to 25 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=812)|
| 0:13:36| And so it'll be a long cul-de-sac.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=816)|
| 0:13:40| So there's not a lot of room for amenities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=820)|
| 0:13:48| So the idea that you could build amenities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=828)|
| 0:13:52| was actually something that the planning commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=832)|
| 0:13:56| spoke to, Ms. Brooks? Yes, that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=836)|
| 0:14:00| correct. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=840)|
| 0:14:04| And you said you could only do probably 24| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=844)|
| 0:14:08| or 25? Mm-hmm. Okay. I'd like to make a recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=848)|
| 0:14:12| then that we approve this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=852)|
| 0:14:16| density at 2.5 per acre. That would give you your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=856)|
| 0:14:20| 25. Okay. So that is my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=860)|
| 0:14:24| I have a motion by Commissioner Hill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=864)|
| 0:14:28| to approve at a density of 2.5 units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=868)|
| 0:14:32| second by Commissioner Schoonmaker. I see lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=872)|
| 0:14:36| I'm not sure of the order, Commissioner Jay, and then Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=876)|
| 0:14:40| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=880)|
| 0:14:44| I guess I'm just curious. The planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=884)|
| 0:14:48| approved three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=888)|
| 0:14:52| Just to clarify, your motion is to downgrade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=892)|
| 0:14:56| that to 2.5?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=896)|
| 0:15:00| Certainly. The reason they stated the approval is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=900)|
| 0:15:04| what really concerns me is because it would allow for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=904)|
| 0:15:08| amenities, but then the builder is saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=908)|
| 0:15:12| there's not going to be any place to put them anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=912)|
| 0:15:16| Thank you for the clarification. Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=916)|
| 0:15:20| Daly. Thank you, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=920)|
| 0:15:24| Chairman. I was trying to find this. Maybe is this in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=924)|
| 0:15:28| rural area? Rural growth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=928)|
| 0:15:32| Yes, it is. And rural growth allows up to three anyway, does it not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=932)|
| 0:15:36| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=936)|
| 0:15:40| Do you really need the sector plan change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=940)|
| 0:15:44| It's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=944)|
| 0:15:48| rural growth plan says for three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=948)|
| 0:15:52| The present plan designation is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=952)|
| 0:15:56| agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=956)|
| 0:16:00| That's the reason for the plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=960)|
| 0:16:04| Sir, are you comfortable with the 2.5?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=964)|
| 0:16:08| Well, I'd certainly rather have the three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=968)|
| 0:16:12| You know, we always| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=972)|
| 0:16:16| approve three. The odds are you're going to get 24.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=976)|
| 0:16:20| And we don't know for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=980)|
| 0:16:24| You don't know for sure until you come back with use-owned-reviewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=984)|
| 0:16:28| Correct. If you come back with use-owned-reviewed, you could have had one more home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=988)|
| 0:16:32| because we dropped it from three to 2.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=992)|
| 0:16:36| It would be a much better project at three per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=996)|
| 0:16:40| We know we can't get 30 units in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=1000)|
| 0:16:48| I'm kind of uncomfortable with Commissioner Hill right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=1008)|
| 0:16:52| He's got to come back for use-owned-reviewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=1012)|
| 0:17:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=1020)|
| 0:17:04| Thank you, Commissioner Daly. Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=1024)|
| 0:17:08| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=1028)|
| 0:17:12| Director Brooks, the property that is to, I assume, the west, that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=1032)|
| 0:17:16| zoned two units per acre, it looks like a cluster development where there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=1036)|
| 0:17:20| were quite a bit of slope on the back of that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=1040)|
| 0:17:24| they left untouched. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=1044)|
| 0:17:28| It appears that way from just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=1048)|
| 0:17:32| glancing at the map. I could pull up the concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=1052)|
| 0:17:36| Looking at this development site, there is a fair amount of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=1056)|
| 0:17:40| slope area on the back of it that might be undeveloped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=1060)|

| 0:19:04| for 2.5 units per acre. That motion was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=1144)|

| 0:19:52| the difference in two or three homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=1192)|
| 0:19:56| It certainly would be huge for a builder and probably in the big scheme of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=1196)|

| 0:20:08| about justifying passing it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=1208)|
| 0:20:12| because they're going to put amenities in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=1212)|
| 0:20:16| when even the builder was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=1216)|
| 0:20:20| honest enough to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=1220)|

| 0:21:04| 30 and 40 more homes, so I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=1264)|
| 0:21:08| am making a statement at this point that I hope we will all remember that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=1268)|
| 0:21:12| when some of the others come down the pipe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=1272)|
| 0:21:16| That said, can I withdraw my original motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=1276)|
| 0:21:20| We have to vote on the substitute motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=1280)|
| 0:21:24| first anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=1284)|

| 0:24:08| So the concept plan lapsed after a year or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=1448)|
| 0:24:12| The property was sold. During that time, the 2020-2012| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=1452)|
| 0:24:16| sector plan update wasn't updated to reflect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=1456)|

| 0:24:32| So it's nothing new. It's not new. It's a new development, but it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=1472)|
| 0:24:36| an old development in the early 2000s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=1476)|
| 0:24:40| Thank you, Commissioner. Commissioner Jay, your light was on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=1480)|
| 0:24:44| before Commissioner Smith turned his on, so I'm going to call on you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=1484)|

| 0:24:56| touching on a point that obviously we talked a long time ago when we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=1496)|
| 0:25:00| I think this was the Bex Hill property when we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=1500)|
| 0:25:04| sort of had a bigger discussion about how many things are out of line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=1504)|
| 0:25:08| I know Director Brooks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=1508)|
| 0:25:12| and I have talked about that, and there's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=1512)|
| 0:25:16| a few. There's hundreds, maybe thousands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=1516)|
| 0:25:20| And their staff, and if you want to elaborate on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=1520)|
| 0:25:24| this, please do, but I know that their staff is trying to go through and better understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=1524)|
| 0:25:28| that before coming back to Commission, but we're at the tip of the iceberg| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=1528)|
| 0:25:32| of a much bigger discussion. I think it's a good one to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=1532)|
| 0:25:36| have because I think we want to make sure that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=1536)|
| 0:25:40| go about this thoughtfully with the team in a proactive way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=1540)|
| 0:25:44| and we don't get surprised again and again and again and again and create unnecessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=1544)|
| 0:25:48| tension, but I wanted to just sort of point out that you guys are already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=1548)|
| 0:25:52| sort of digging into this and maybe, I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=1552)|
| 0:25:56| if now is the right time to give an update or if you want to come back to us in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=1556)|
| 0:26:00| new year, but I think it's a good thing we're discovering it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=1560)|
| 0:26:04| but it's a big project. Correct. And this is, thank you Commissioner for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=1564)|
| 0:26:08| this particular item is outside of that other effort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=1568)|
| 0:26:12| after Bex Hill, staff started to map out where all those errors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211220-zoning?start=1572)|
