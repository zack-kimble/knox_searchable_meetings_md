| 0:01:44| 2535 Willow Point Way on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=104)|
| 0:01:47| premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=107)|
| 0:01:52| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=112)|
| 0:01:54| Yes, my name is Chris Sykes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=114)|
| 0:01:55| I'm with Doodles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=115)|
| 0:01:56| And we're actually trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=116)|
| 0:01:57| get approval on our beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=117)|
| 0:01:59| And I actually took a plot map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=119)|
| 0:02:01| and showed it to her up there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=121)|
| 0:02:03| where our restaurant actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=123)|
| 0:02:04| falls within 500 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=124)|
| 0:02:07| But it's all commercial except| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=127)|
| 0:02:09| for the driveway easement that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=129)|
| 0:02:11| goes between two commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=131)|
| 0:02:13| properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=133)|
| 0:02:14| That's what falls there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=134)|
| 0:02:15| That actually can't even be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=135)|
| 0:02:17| built on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=137)|
| 0:02:18| So that's kind of where we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=138)|
| 0:02:20| trying to see if we can work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=140)|
| 0:02:22| around that somehow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=142)|
| 0:02:23| And we actually, I've actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=143)|
| 0:02:25| even got a document from the one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=145)|
| 0:02:27| homeowner where he signed off on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=147)|
| 0:02:29| it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=149)|
| 0:02:30| He was looking forward to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=150)|
| 0:02:32| opening actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=152)|
| 0:02:33| But like I said, it's a driveway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=153)|
| 0:02:35| easement, I mean, within two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=155)|
| 0:02:37| commercial properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=157)|
| 0:02:38| Even the codes office, whenever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=158)|
| 0:02:40| I questioned it, he called me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=160)|
| 0:02:42| and said we couldn't get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=162)|
| 0:02:44| He had to go back and look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=164)|
| 0:02:45| it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=165)|
| 0:02:46| He said he didn't think that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=166)|
| 0:02:48| right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=168)|
| 0:02:49| There's not a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=169)|
| 0:02:51| There's not a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=171)|

| 0:04:33| the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=273)|
| 0:04:34| In the business in which it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=274)|
| 0:04:36| going to be licensed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=276)|
| 0:04:37| No, well, it's just me and my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=277)|
| 0:04:39| partner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=279)|
| 0:04:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=280)|
| 0:04:41| And your partner, the answer to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=281)|
| 0:04:43| the question that I asked you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=283)|
| 0:04:45| about, your employee or owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=285)|
| 0:04:47| is still true with a partner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=287)|
| 0:04:49| Who's going to actually operate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=289)|
| 0:04:51| this business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=291)|
| 0:04:52| Myself and my partner, Lisa| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=292)|
| 0:04:54| Hanna.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=294)|
| 0:04:55| Are you familiar with the Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=295)|
| 0:04:57| County and Tennessee beer laws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=297)|
| 0:04:59| and regulations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=299)|
| 0:05:00| And do you agree to conduct the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=300)|
| 0:05:02| business in conformity with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=302)|
| 0:05:04| them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=304)|
| 0:05:05| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=305)|
| 0:05:06| Before I ask our staff over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=306)|
| 0:05:08| here, we've reviewed your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=308)|
| 0:05:11| distance issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=311)|
| 0:05:12| And according to the state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=312)|
| 0:05:14| it's a direct line method from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=314)|
| 0:05:16| building to building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=316)|
| 0:05:18| And from the residence in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=318)|
| 0:05:19| question to the location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=319)|
| 0:05:21| physical location of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=321)|
| 0:05:23| building, you are over 500 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=323)|
| 0:05:25| away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=325)|
| 0:05:26| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=326)|
| 0:05:27| So from the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=327)|
| 0:05:28| standpoint, we don't see any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=328)|
| 0:05:30| conflict with the statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=330)|
| 0:05:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=333)|
| 0:05:35| When did that change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=335)|
| 0:05:37| It's always been in statute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=337)|
| 0:05:39| today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=339)|
| 0:05:40| Property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=340)|
| 0:05:41| It is Tennessee statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=341)|
| 0:05:45| Wasn't it, Roy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=345)|
| 0:05:46| Wasn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=346)|
| 0:05:47| Property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=347)|
| 0:05:50| The zoning ordinance reads just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=350)|
| 0:05:52| to the zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=352)|
| 0:05:53| It doesn't talk about buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=353)|
| 0:05:54| at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=354)|
| 0:05:55| So all I have to go by is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=355)|
| 0:05:57| Knox County zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=357)|
| 0:05:59| It says from zone, building to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=359)|
| 0:06:01| zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=361)|
| 0:06:03| The interpretation we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=363)|
| 0:06:04| before was just to the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=364)|
| 0:06:06| line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=366)|
| 0:06:07| That's why this is a variance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=367)|
| 0:06:08| from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=368)|
| 0:06:09| I want to be sure we're all on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=369)|
| 0:06:10| the same page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=370)|
| 0:06:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=371)|
| 0:06:12| On the measurement to enforce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=372)|
| 0:06:13| distance rules by the Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=373)|
| 0:06:14| Supreme Court in Jones versus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=374)|
| 0:06:15| Sullivan and the statute 575105B1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=375)|
| 0:06:21| requires that it be building to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=381)|
| 0:06:23| building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=383)|
| 0:06:25| And that's where I'm coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=385)|
| 0:06:26| from on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=386)|
| 0:06:30| You're in a disagreement with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=390)|
| 0:06:32| that, staff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=392)|
| 0:06:33| Sir, I'm just saying that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=393)|
| 0:06:35| zoning ordinance says to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=395)|
| 0:06:36| zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=396)|
| 0:06:37| And this particular business is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=397)|
| 0:06:39| from the building to the zone is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=399)|
| 0:06:41| 420 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=401)|
| 0:06:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=403)|
| 0:06:45| I'm not disagreeing with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=405)|
| 0:06:46| I'm just saying we need to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=406)|
| 0:06:49| everybody needs a clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=409)|
| 0:06:50| understanding of what we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=410)|
| 0:06:51| measuring here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=411)|
| 0:06:54| I'm just giving you the legal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=414)|
| 0:06:55| opinion of what the Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=415)|
| 0:06:57| Supreme Court says on how we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=417)|
| 0:06:58| should measure these zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=418)|
| 0:07:02| And it's talking building to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=422)|
| 0:07:03| building, even though we'll have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=423)|
| 0:07:05| to look and see what our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=425)|
| 0:07:06| ordinances are in compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=426)|
| 0:07:08| with state law or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=428)|
| 0:07:16| You don't agree with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=436)|
| 0:07:19| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=439)|
| 0:07:20| There's no question that that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=440)|
| 0:07:21| what state law provides, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=441)|
| 0:07:23| 300-feet residence to residence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=443)|
| 0:07:25| 500 feet or 1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=445)|
| 0:07:26| I can't remember which for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=446)|
| 0:07:28| schools, churches and public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=448)|
| 0:07:29| gathering places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=449)|
| 0:07:31| Our ordinance can be more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=451)|
| 0:07:32| strict, however, than state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=452)|
| 0:07:35| But the measurement of state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=455)|
| 0:07:36| law, what has been contested in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=456)|
| 0:07:40| court, has been building to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=460)|
| 0:07:42| building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=462)|
| 0:07:43| So we may need to look at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=463)|
| 0:07:44| ordinance and have Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=464)|
| 0:07:46| revisit that ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=466)|
| 0:07:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=467)|
| 0:07:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=471)|
| 0:07:52| I'll turn it over now to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=472)|
| 0:07:53| staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=473)|
| 0:07:56| Health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=476)|
| 0:08:02| Sheriff's department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=482)|
| 0:08:06| Got a new beer inspector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=486)|
| 0:08:08| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=488)|
| 0:08:12| Fire marshal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=492)|
| 0:08:14| Pending a certificate of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=494)|
| 0:08:15| occupancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=495)|
| 0:08:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=496)|
| 0:08:17| Coach, we had an issue based on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=497)|
| 0:08:18| the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=498)|
| 0:08:19| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=499)|
| 0:08:20| This is the 420 feet to the zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=500)|
| 0:08:23| Instead of another building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=503)|
| 0:08:24| it's 420 to the actual zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=504)|
| 0:08:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=509)|
| 0:08:30| We have a conflict, but at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=510)|
| 0:08:34| point in time, the only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=514)|
| 0:08:35| recommendation I can tell you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=515)|
| 0:08:36| is that state law allows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=516)|
| 0:08:38| building to building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=518)|
| 0:08:39| We probably need to look at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=519)|
| 0:08:40| ordinance to see to get it in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=520)|
| 0:08:41| compliance with the Supreme| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=521)|
| 0:08:42| Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=522)|

| 0:09:01| pending the health and fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=541)|

| 0:22:06| I want to thank the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1326)|
| 0:22:07| for giving me this opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1327)|
| 0:22:08| to speak before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1328)|
| 0:22:09| My husband and I own a small| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1329)|
| 0:22:10| business here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1330)|
| 0:22:11| It's been here since 1978.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1331)|
| 0:22:12| Our son, Steve Newberry II, is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1332)|
| 0:22:13| going to be handing out some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1333)|
| 0:22:14| packages of information that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1334)|
| 0:22:15| has a lot of the detailed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1335)|
| 0:22:16| background as to what I'm going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1336)|
| 0:22:17| to be addressing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1337)|
| 0:22:18| So I'm going to start with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1338)|
| 0:22:19| introducing myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1339)|
| 0:22:20| I'm Pat Beasley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1340)|
| 0:22:21| I'm the principal of the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1341)|
| 0:22:22| I'm the principal of the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1342)|
| 0:22:23| I'm the principal of the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1343)|
| 0:22:24| I'm the principal of the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1344)|
| 0:22:25| I'm the principal of the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1345)|
| 0:22:26| I'm the principal of the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1346)|
| 0:22:28| My name is Pat Beasley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1348)|
| 0:22:29| I'm the principal of the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1349)|
| 0:22:30| I'm a jury of anyone that has a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1350)|
| 0:22:31| lot of the detailed information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1351)|
| 0:22:32| background as to what I'm going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1352)|
| 0:22:33| to be addressing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1353)|
| 0:22:34| Our discussion is centered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1354)|
| 0:22:38| around our protest of an award| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1358)|
| 0:22:42| that was recently given by Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1362)|
| 0:22:45| County regarding the information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1365)|
| 0:22:48| technology equipment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1368)|
| 0:22:50| specifically the Dell equipment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1370)|
| 0:22:53| that it's been awarded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1373)|
| 0:22:56| We have appealed this through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1376)|
| 0:22:57| through purchasing, then to the finance director, and then to the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1377)|
| 0:23:03| There was additional information that has been found since those appeals were presented and decisions rendered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1383)|
| 0:23:14| The information that we were made aware of was on the company that has been doing business with Knox County for several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1394)|
| 0:23:23| It is a company that was awarded the Dell desktop and laptop contract for the next five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1403)|
| 0:23:34| We found that that company is not authorized to do business in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1414)|
| 0:23:40| Now I want you to understand, I've known Hugh Holt for many, many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1420)|
| 0:23:47| Hugh Holt would never, ever knowingly do business with a company that is not authorized to do business in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1427)|
| 0:23:54| This is information that has come up since our appeals were submitted and denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1434)|
| 0:24:01| The reason they are not compliant is because they have never submitted a filing with the Secretary of State of Tennessee to do business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1441)|
| 0:24:13| nor have they ever filed an annual report with the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1453)|
| 0:24:19| We know that they are aware of that requirement because when they were started in Texas, they were filed with the Texas Secretary of State.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1459)|
| 0:24:26| But the state of Tennessee requires that any LLC coming from another state must submit, request a certificate of authority from the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1466)|
| 0:24:35| and that has never been done for all the years that that company has been doing business in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1475)|
| 0:24:40| So that's one of the items that we feel is that we would like to question on this bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1480)|
| 0:24:49| We also believe that there was incorrect product bid that was based on cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1489)|
| 0:24:53| It was required by Dell to submit the exact same pricing to all interested bidders on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1493)|
| 0:25:03| Obviously, looking at the bids that were turned in, the cost information was not what Dell had given all the vendors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1503)|
| 0:25:12| We also believe that the IFB, invitation for bid, was not followed because specifications were not submitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1512)|
| 0:25:20| which was a requirement of the IFB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1520)|
| 0:25:24| There are five different places within the IFB where it specifically mentions specifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1524)|
| 0:25:32| That's critical when you're dealing with IT equipment to know that what is being bid is exactly what Knox County is asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1532)|
| 0:25:40| We also have submitted in your packet, there's information, there was a presentation that was put together three years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1540)|
| 0:25:48| where we contested some pricing that was done by two of the other vendors where they changed their pricing two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1548)|
| 0:25:57| at least two years, into the original contract that was made five years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1557)|
| 0:26:02| The information on that, that full presentation that was given to purchasing and the mayor then is in the packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1562)|
| 0:26:12| Last, we would like for County Commission to also consider the fact that we're a local company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1572)|
| 0:26:18| All the other bidders that were awarded were not local companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1578)|
| 0:26:23| We do business in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1583)|
| 0:26:25| We submit business revenue taxes to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1585)|
| 0:26:28| We would simply like to be given a small amount of consideration for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1588)|
| 0:26:34| So, in this packet, I have given a lot of information, a lot of background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1594)|
| 0:26:39| What we're asking is that the Commission consider, our requests are that the Commission submit this to the Audit Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1599)|
| 0:26:47| and possibly to the County Independent Auditor to review this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1607)|
| 0:26:51| and that until a new contract is awarded for the company that received it that is not authorized to do business in the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1611)|
| 0:27:00| that you extend the past contract until that item is resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1620)|
| 0:27:08| Does anyone have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1628)|
| 0:27:14| Any questions, Commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1634)|
| 0:27:16| Mr. Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1636)|
| 0:27:17| I'd like to hear from our Law Director on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1637)|
| 0:27:21| Thank you, Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1641)|
| 0:27:23| We've done our evaluation of the current bid system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1643)|
| 0:27:29| It was a pure price bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1649)|
| 0:27:31| The bid was submitted to the purchasing department to make it very plain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1651)|
| 0:27:40| They dotted their I's, crossed their T's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1660)|
| 0:27:42| It seemed to be in process and above board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1662)|
| 0:27:47| The question here before you is it was a pure price award bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1667)|
| 0:27:53| The company is a Texas company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1673)|
| 0:27:55| They've registered to pay franchise taxes and do business in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1675)|
| 0:28:00| They have won the bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1680)|
| 0:28:04| We have an appeal process, which we have followed the appeal process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1684)|
| 0:28:08| The next appeal in order of appeal and the one that was referred to before, I think, was overturned at the mayor appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1688)|
| 0:28:17| if I'm not mistaken, in the history of prior events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1697)|
| 0:28:23| Currently, right now, the next appeal would be to Chantry or Circuit Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1703)|
| 0:28:29| This debate, in my opinion, is at the wrong forum, but it's entirely up to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1709)|
| 0:28:36| But the next legal appeal concerning this issue is that they would file a complaint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1716)|
| 0:28:41| and we would proceed and represent Knox County and let Trier FAC review what's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1721)|
| 0:28:48| Do we know about whether they are authorized to do business in the state with the annual report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1728)|
| 0:28:54| and filing with the Secretary of State?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1734)|
| 0:28:57| We haven't found a filing with the Secretary of State in terms of their as a corporation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1737)|
| 0:29:04| but they have filed and currently pay their franchise taxes in the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1744)|
| 0:29:09| and they do business in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1749)|
| 0:29:12| So they're registered with the state of Tennessee, whether it's through the normal Secretary of State or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1752)|
| 0:29:16| and they do pay taxes to do business in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1756)|
| 0:29:21| You know, whether that would be sufficient would be up to a court to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1761)|
| 0:29:24| May I respond to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1764)|
| 0:29:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1766)|
| 0:29:28| Our records show that this company is not registered with the Secretary of State in the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1768)|
| 0:29:33| nor have they filed any annual reports as required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1773)|
| 0:29:37| Again, when they were in Texas, they did file their annual reports, and they were registered in Texas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1777)|
| 0:29:45| One of the things that when you file with the Secretary of State is it assures you that you can use that name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1785)|
| 0:29:53| that legal name, and your DBAs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1793)|
| 0:29:56| When we were made aware that this company was not listed with the Secretary of State,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1796)|
| 0:30:02| nor had they reserved their name, we have temporarily reserved their name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1802)|
| 0:30:07| They do not have access to using their legal name nor their DBAs right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1807)|
| 0:30:13| I promise you, I don't want to keep her name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1813)|
| 0:30:15| I don't want to keep her from doing business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1815)|
| 0:30:17| I'm simply holding this because I want this to be resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1817)|
| 0:30:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1825)|
| 0:30:26| Thank you, Ms. Beasley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1826)|
| 0:30:29| We'll note we do have the Vice Chair of the Audit Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1829)|
| 0:30:32| and two members of the Audit Committee here in attendance with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1832)|
| 0:30:36| We'll note this and at least forward this on as an item to be considered by them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1836)|
| 0:30:43| That's up to them, what they want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1843)|
| 0:30:45| And also to Mr. Walls, that's up for their consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1845)|
| 0:30:50| But we appreciate you coming and sharing this information with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1850)|
| 0:30:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1853)|
| 0:30:54| And the reason I did come before this group is because it was suggested by Commissioner Briggs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1854)|
| 0:31:01| that I bring this before the group because he felt that it should go before the Audit Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1861)|
| 0:31:06| That is why we brought it to this organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1866)|
| 0:31:10| If the only other option that we have is to go before Chancery Court, we'll address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1870)|
| 0:31:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1876)|
| 0:31:17| Thank you, Ms. Beasley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1877)|
| 0:31:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1878)|
| 0:31:19| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1879)|
| 0:31:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1880)|
| 0:31:21| Oh, I'm sorry, Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1881)|
| 0:31:22| Do you need Ms. Beasley back at the microphone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1882)|
| 0:31:25| No, I was just going to say I want this added to next month's agenda as a discussion item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1885)|
| 0:31:29| and I will be taking it to Audit Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1889)|
| 0:31:31| I'm not satisfied with the answer that they've done part of what they're supposed to do to do business in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1891)|
| 0:31:39| I don't think that it's fair to give business to a company that's not doing everything that they're supposed to be doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1899)|
| 0:31:44| I've looked through this whole packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1904)|
| 0:31:45| I've talked to a professional who is retired from the Electric Power Board in Chattanooga as their purchasing manager| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1905)|
| 0:31:53| who thinks that this is a big mess that Knox County has, and there's a lot of things that need to be answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1913)|
| 0:32:00| I'll be meeting, hopefully, with Mike and with Hugh over the next month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1920)|
| 0:32:04| but I want this added to next month's agenda as a discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1924)|
| 0:32:07| I don't think it's something that we need to just kind of pass on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1927)|
| 0:32:11| We need to be looking at this more closely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1931)|
| 0:32:13| That it will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1933)|
| 0:32:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1934)|
| 0:32:15| And Mr. Shouse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1935)|
| 0:32:17| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1937)|
| 0:32:19| I certainly concur with Commissioner Broll's suggestion that we put it on the Audit Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1939)|
| 0:32:25| That will be, however, seven weeks from tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1945)|
| 0:32:27| I just looked at my calendar, so it's not happening real, real soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1947)|
| 0:32:32| It's not extremely far away, but we meet in seven weeks, so we can certainly have it on our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1952)|
| 0:32:36| And move forward with the three of us and the two outside professional people to, hopefully,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1956)|
| 0:32:43| a resolution of whatever is found out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1963)|
| 0:32:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1966)|
| 0:32:47| It's covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1967)|
| 0:32:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1968)|
| 0:32:49| Thank you, Mr. Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1969)|
| 0:32:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1970)|
| 0:32:51| Now we're.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1971)|
| 0:32:52| Commissioner Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1972)|
| 0:32:53| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1973)|
| 0:32:54| May I interrupt and ask for two minutes, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1974)|
| 0:32:56| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1976)|
| 0:32:57| My name is Esther Bell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1977)|
| 0:32:58| I am the attorney of record for the awardee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1978)|
| 0:33:01| And your address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1981)|
| 0:33:02| I beg your pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1982)|
| 0:33:03| And your address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1983)|
| 0:33:04| 507 South Gay Street, Suite 910, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1984)|
| 0:33:09| My law firm is Global Intellectual Property Asset Management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1989)|
| 0:33:13| And I was retained at 10 this morning in anticipation of today's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1993)|
| 0:33:17| So based on that, I certainly very respectfully appreciate what Commissioner Broll's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=1997)|
| 0:33:23| and Commissioner Shouse have requested as far as next month's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2003)|
| 0:33:27| I also would like to concur with what Attorney Armstrong has said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2007)|
| 0:33:31| And in addition, upon review of the contract as it was awarded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2011)|
| 0:33:36| there is no requisition in that contract language that any successful bidder be registered with the State of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2016)|
| 0:33:43| Further, as Attorney Armstrong has noted, this company, SOS Computers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2023)|
| 0:33:50| has performed faithfully for 16 years to serve Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2030)|
| 0:33:54| And they have paid their state income tax on a regular basis and never complained about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2034)|
| 0:34:00| Finally, in the contract itself as awarded, Clause 1.33 notes a waiving of informalities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2040)|
| 0:34:06| I quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2046)|
| 0:34:07| Knox County reserves the right to waive minor informalities or technicalities when it is in the best interest of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2047)|
| 0:34:14| So we would respectfully argue that my client, SOS Computing, has done everything required,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2054)|
| 0:34:22| has served Knox County faithfully,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2062)|
| 0:34:24| and requests this Commission's approval and affirmation of what your internal processes up through the County Mayor's Office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2064)|
| 0:34:32| have already determined that this was a lawfully awarded contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2072)|
| 0:34:35| And we would like to move forward so that the equipment can be placed timely in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2075)|
| 0:34:40| and service can go on without interruption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2080)|
| 0:34:43| Other legal recourses that my client may have as against the Computer for tortious interference of business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2083)|
| 0:34:49| or trying to take their lawful names are certainly outside the scope of this Commissioner's meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2089)|
| 0:34:55| and we will not address those at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2095)|
| 0:34:57| But I appreciate your time, and I'll be happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2097)|
| 0:35:00| Otherwise, I will retire with your grace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2100)|
| 0:35:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2102)|
| 0:35:03| Thank you, Ms. Freud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2103)|
| 0:35:05| I don't know if I can follow that or not, retire with grace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2105)|
| 0:35:10| Who's she?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2110)|
| 0:35:13| Oh, it's even better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2113)|
| 0:35:15| I say this for the benefit of the superintendent of schools from this good old country boy here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2115)|
| 0:35:21| I'm on my fourth law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2121)|
| 0:35:24| and I believe I just heard the words of the law director saying that this may not be the appropriate venue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2124)|
| 0:35:30| I'm not saying that's the way for this to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2130)|
| 0:35:33| but what I am saying is that I will support the law director's opinion of the direction that Knox County may be headed in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2133)|
| 0:35:44| but I believe it best that the parties involved here understand that it may not be a decision made here that will affect these contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2144)|
| 0:35:54| That's my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2154)|
| 0:35:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2156)|
| 0:35:57| Thank you, Mr. Freud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2157)|
| 0:35:58| Ms. Boyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2158)|
| 0:35:59| This contract has to come before the commission to be approved, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2159)|
| 0:36:03| Not on this particular contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2163)|
| 0:36:05| It's through the purchase order procedure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2165)|
| 0:36:07| and this is not normally a contract that comes before the county commission, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2167)|
| 0:36:12| So in the process of which it was designed to do, it operated and functioned correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2172)|
| 0:36:19| That's why the appeals were the way they were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2179)|
| 0:36:22| Really, this body is kind of a ----| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2182)|
| 0:36:23| I'm not willing or ready to let this go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2183)|
| 0:36:26| There are too many unanswered questions, and I understand you were just retained this morning at 10,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2186)|
| 0:36:31| and I appreciate you being here, but I'm still not satisfied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2191)|
| 0:36:36| I think that I'll need to do a little deeper digging into this, so I look forward to talking to you as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2196)|
| 0:36:41| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2201)|
| 0:36:42| I'm at your disposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2202)|
| 0:36:43| And I will say as well that the awardee is also a small business and a minority-owned business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2203)|
| 0:36:48| So we appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2208)|
| 0:36:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2210)|
| 0:36:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2211)|
| 0:36:52| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2212)|
| 0:36:53| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2213)|
| 0:36:55| Commissioner Boyles, did we need to change that from October then to November| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2215)|
| 0:36:59| if the audit committee is not going to have a chance to look at it for seven weeks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2219)|
| 0:37:02| I'm just trying to look at logistics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2222)|
| 0:37:04| No, I would like for us to look at it as a discussion item next month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2224)|
| 0:37:08| because it may be that we don't need to do anything further with the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2228)|
| 0:37:12| So it may end up saving us some time on down the road, just depending on how it turns out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2232)|
| 0:37:18| But I want a month to look into this a little more in depth and discuss it as a group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2238)|
| 0:37:23| And then if we need to, we can move forward with the audit committee at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2243)|
| 0:37:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2247)|
| 0:37:28| And, Mr. Chairman, I think Ms. Beasley had a rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2248)|
| 0:37:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2249)|
| 0:37:30| Just real briefly, Ms. Beasley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2250)|
| 0:37:32| Very briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2252)|
| 0:37:33| I just want to mention the attorney that's been retained mentioned that there's nothing in the IFB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2253)|
| 0:37:39| that requires that the company be registered with the Secretary of State.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2259)|
| 0:37:43| There are two places in the IFB where it states that all bidders must be compliant with all state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2263)|
| 0:37:50| and federal and local laws, regulations, statutes, and ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2270)|
| 0:37:55| And that is what we were basing our belief that they are not in compliance with all state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2275)|
| 0:38:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2282)|
| 0:38:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2283)|
| 0:38:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2284)|
| 0:38:05| And certainly we'll be deferring to the law director and his guidance in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2285)|
| 0:38:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2290)|
| 0:38:11| Any other things related to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2291)|
| 0:38:13| We're going to move on in the agenda to our honorary resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2293)|
| 0:38:18| Madam Clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2298)|
| 0:38:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2303)|
| 0:38:24| And could we hear a motion to add these to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2304)|
| 0:38:30| In a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2310)|
| 0:38:31| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2311)|
| 0:38:32| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2312)|
| 0:38:33| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2313)|
| 0:38:34| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2314)|
| 0:38:35| Madam Clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2315)|
| 0:38:38| Resolution 101 is consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2318)|
| 0:38:42| supporting Thank a Teacher Week in Knox County September 24th through the 30th, 2012| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2322)|
| 0:38:49| and encouraging all Knox County citizens to participate in Thank a Teacher Week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2329)|
| 0:38:54| by thanking teachers for a job well done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2334)|
| 0:38:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2338)|
| 0:38:59| Any comments from the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2339)|
| 0:39:01| Mr. Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2341)|
| 0:39:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2342)|
| 0:39:03| I understand that it started this morning with breakfast being served by our superintendent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2343)|
| 0:39:07| mayor, and others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2347)|
| 0:39:08| And that was a very great gesture on their part to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2348)|
| 0:39:11| I'm not sure what the food tasted like, but I'm sure it was very tasty and that they enjoyed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2351)|
| 0:39:16| I'm going to be taking lunch over to the elementary school teachers at Gap Creek on Thursday at 1030.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2356)|
| 0:39:23| Any commissioner that would like to join me, feel free to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2363)|
| 0:39:26| And also Friday morning I'll be taking some breakfast bagels over to teachers at Carnes Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2366)|
| 0:39:32| And, again, the invitation is there to any commissioner that would like to join in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2372)|
| 0:39:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2376)|
| 0:39:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2377)|
| 0:39:38| And the applause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2378)|
| 0:39:39| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2379)|
| 0:39:41| Mr. Owenby?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2381)|
| 0:39:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2383)|
| 0:39:44| In anticipation of this, I got the email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2384)|
| 0:39:47| I started it this weekend thanking teachers and my past ones on Facebook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2387)|
| 0:39:52| And the overwhelming support out there from the public to thank a lot of past teachers as well as present ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2392)|
| 0:39:58| And a lot of the past ones kind of found out or taught my son, which doesn't say much for me or, I guess, my age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2398)|
| 0:40:12| So they were young when I went there, so I guess that's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2412)|
| 0:40:17| But I would encourage everybody to please get out there and get into your schools as a parent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2417)|
| 0:40:24| and thank these teachers because they are developing and molding our children for the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2424)|
| 0:40:31| And I appreciate everything they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2431)|
| 0:40:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2435)|
| 0:40:36| And thank you for all who are involved in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2436)|
| 0:40:39| I know the superintendent is and the staff is involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2439)|
| 0:40:42| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2442)|
| 0:40:44| And I'll assure you there's no small thing that's done for teachers that is not appreciated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2444)|
| 0:40:49| They're a vastly underappreciated lot, I think, from my experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2449)|
| 0:40:54| So whatever you do to thank a teacher, they'll greatly appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2454)|
| 0:41:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2462)|
| 0:41:03| We need a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2463)|
| 0:41:05| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2465)|
| 0:41:06| Second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2466)|
| 0:41:07| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2467)|
| 0:41:08| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2468)|
| 0:41:09| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2469)|
| 0:41:10| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2470)|
| 0:41:11| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2471)|
| 0:41:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2472)|
| 0:41:14| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2474)|
| 0:41:15| Resolution 102 is consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2475)|
| 0:41:20| thanking the Charter Review Committee for a job well done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2480)|
| 0:41:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2485)|
| 0:41:26| Is Craig Luthold here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2486)|
| 0:41:28| Craig, come on down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2488)|
| 0:41:30| And, of course, Craig was the chair of the Charter Review Committee, and that's a lot of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2490)|
| 0:41:35| And it was some really convoluted processing that he did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2495)|
| 0:41:42| And so, personally, I'd like to express appreciation to you, Craig, from us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2502)|
| 0:41:47| and from the county for what you did and all the time that you put into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2507)|
| 0:41:52| Go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2512)|
| 0:41:53| Would you like to say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2513)|
| 0:41:54| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2514)|
| 0:41:55| Craig Luthold, 1320 Zachary Taylor Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2515)|
| 0:41:57| I know where you're sitting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2517)|
| 0:42:00| I want to thank the commission for taking a look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2520)|
| 0:42:04| and recognizing the work that the review committee did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2524)|
| 0:42:09| Not all of you served on it except for Ed and Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2529)|
| 0:42:14| But the committee put in a lot of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2534)|
| 0:42:15| It started in February, wrapped up at the end of August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2535)|
| 0:42:20| We looked at a lot of issues pertaining to the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2540)|
| 0:42:26| As you alluded to, it was tough work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2546)|
| 0:42:30| It took a lot of digging into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2550)|
| 0:42:33| And not everybody got what they wanted on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2553)|
| 0:42:37| There are things that are on the ballot that people didn't want on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2557)|
| 0:42:40| So I think that sort of serves as a – that we did go through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2560)|
| 0:42:45| We vetted every issue that I think came before us very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2565)|
| 0:42:50| And I do appreciate my fellow members electing me as chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2570)|
| 0:42:57| It was an honor to serve for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2577)|
| 0:42:58| And, again, if there's any questions, I'll be free to answer them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2578)|
| 0:43:06| Just to let you know, there are seven ballot questions that will appear on the November ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2586)|
| 0:43:13| And hopefully the voters will take a look at it and study it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2593)|
| 0:43:18| Would you mind summarizing all seven of those for us right now, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2598)|
| 0:43:22| No, I'm just kidding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2602)|
| 0:43:25| We don't have time to go through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2605)|
| 0:43:27| But since you have brought that up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2607)|
| 0:43:29| I did receive a call from a representative of the League of Women Voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2609)|
| 0:43:34| And we're going to be working with them to try to set up a forum so that we can have a public hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2614)|
| 0:43:43| to allow the public to understand these very important issues before they go into that voting booth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2623)|
| 0:43:51| so they'll know what they're voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2631)|
| 0:43:53| And I think it's very important that the public has a good understanding of what a yes vote means| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2633)|
| 0:43:59| and what a no vote means so that Knox County can go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2639)|
| 0:44:04| Thank you, Craig.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2644)|
| 0:44:05| And, indeed, we had quite a bit of controversy over some wording and votes and what they meant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2645)|
| 0:44:12| And it is very critical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2652)|
| 0:44:13| In the past, there have been some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2653)|
| 0:44:15| And hopefully we can get the word out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2655)|
| 0:44:19| Unfortunately, this body, the charter review body, doesn't have a budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2659)|
| 0:44:24| So it has no way of trying to get the word out other than the help of, I know, the Sentinel was there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2664)|
| 0:44:33| and covered it quite extensively and did a good job doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2673)|
| 0:44:37| And I appreciate the way they reported it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2677)|
| 0:44:40| But we still need to get the word out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2680)|
| 0:44:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2682)|
| 0:44:43| You have a couple of people that have got lights on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2683)|
| 0:44:45| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2685)|
| 0:44:46| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2686)|
| 0:44:48| Craig, you did a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2688)|
| 0:44:50| I really appreciate what you did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2690)|
| 0:44:51| Moving forward, if you will, if you'll work hand-in-hand with the Sentinel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2691)|
| 0:44:54| because I know you have volunteered to go around and give speeches and stuff to these different groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2694)|
| 0:44:59| if we can publicize this in the paper, because that's the most important part as we move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2699)|
| 0:45:04| So, you know, my phone number is in the phone book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2704)|
| 0:45:07| If there's any groups out there that would like for me to come out and speak, as long as I'm available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2707)|
| 0:45:12| I'll be happy to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2712)|
| 0:45:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2713)|
| 0:45:14| And I want to just make one real quick mention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2714)|
| 0:45:16| I see Nick McBride is sitting out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2716)|
| 0:45:18| Nick is from the employee standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2718)|
| 0:45:20| I thought you had valuable input to the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2720)|
| 0:45:22| I really appreciate your thoughtfulness and input that you put in the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2722)|
| 0:45:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2727)|
| 0:45:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2728)|
| 0:45:29| Mr. Orenby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2729)|
| 0:45:30| Yeah, Chairman, I just want to thank you for your leadership during that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2730)|
| 0:45:34| And I've already had one public one, and I'm planning on having another one October 4th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2734)|
| 0:45:39| If you can attend, it would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2739)|
| 0:45:42| I plan on trying to be there, Commissioner, and that is at the Cedar Bluff Library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2742)|
| 0:45:48| Yes, it's from 6 to 7 on October 4th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2748)|
| 0:45:50| Everyone is welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2750)|
| 0:45:52| And it's just information so that people can be aware of what these amendments are before they go in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2752)|
| 0:45:57| because they can be overwhelming, especially when you have seven or eight of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2757)|
| 0:46:01| Well, we do have something else going on in November that we might be voting on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2761)|
| 0:46:05| and it might be a few people show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2765)|
| 0:46:09| But if people know how they're going to vote before they walk into the booth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2769)|
| 0:46:13| I think that will help the process going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2773)|
| 0:46:16| I remember one time it was my wife when she was pregnant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2776)|
| 0:46:21| Now, that's going back a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2781)|
| 0:46:24| We voted at Bluegrass School, and at that time the line wrapped all the way around the school and then some,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2784)|
| 0:46:31| and she had to wait for about two or three hours to get in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2791)|
| 0:46:35| So if people understand how they're going to vote prior to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2795)|
| 0:46:39| and if they can get through those questions quicker, that will help everybody else out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2799)|
| 0:46:44| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2804)|
| 0:46:45| But I plan on having handouts, so anybody that wants one, they can take them home and study them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2805)|
| 0:46:49| But at least we'll have a couple of members there that were on the Charter Review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2809)|
| 0:46:53| and be able to answer some of the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2813)|
| 0:46:55| But please, public, come out, get informed, and I'm sure we'll have more between now and November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2815)|
| 0:47:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2821)|
| 0:47:02| I appreciate you doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2822)|
| 0:47:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2823)|
| 0:47:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2824)|
| 0:47:05| Thank you, Mr. Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2825)|
| 0:47:06| Thank you to the members of the Charter Review Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2826)|
| 0:47:08| and to the commissioners that participated in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2828)|
| 0:47:11| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2831)|
| 0:47:12| I appreciate your recognition, and I'm sure everybody else on the committee does as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2832)|
| 0:47:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2835)|
| 0:47:16| We need a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2836)|
| 0:47:19| I'll move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2839)|
| 0:47:20| Second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2840)|
| 0:47:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2841)|
| 0:47:22| Here's a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2842)|
| 0:47:23| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2843)|
| 0:47:24| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2844)|
| 0:47:25| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2845)|
| 0:47:26| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2846)|

| 0:48:03| We have nine members present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2883)|
| 0:48:07| On short notice, Commissioner Hammond has offered to sub in for Commissioner Briggs for our devotional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2887)|
| 0:48:15| So thank you, Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2895)|
| 0:48:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2897)|
| 0:48:18| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2898)|
| 0:48:19| Ladies and gentlemen, if we could bow our heads in prayer, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2899)|
| 0:48:21| Heavenly Fathers, we gather here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2901)|
| 0:48:23| It is with a grateful and a humble heart that we have an opportunity to serve the people of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2903)|
| 0:48:29| As we go forward in our meeting, I pray for wisdom, for guidance, for civility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2909)|
| 0:48:33| and for discernment as we discuss and deliberate our decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2913)|
| 0:48:37| I pray today for our military overseas and for their families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2917)|
| 0:48:40| I pray for our police and our fire departments and our EMTs and those who serve us 24 hours, seven days a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2920)|
| 0:48:46| We're just thankful for them and the sacrifice that they make for us on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2926)|
| 0:48:50| For this we ask in Jesus' name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2930)|
| 0:48:52| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2932)|
| 0:48:53| Ms. Boyles, will you lead us in the pledge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2933)|
| 0:48:57| We stand as one flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2937)|
| 0:49:01| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2941)|
| 0:49:06| and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2946)|
| 0:49:23| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2963)|
| 0:49:24| I'd like to hear a motion to approve the minutes of the previous meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2964)|
| 0:49:28| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2968)|
| 0:49:29| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2969)|
| 0:49:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2970)|
| 0:49:31| With regards to the minutes, there is something that needed to be clarified, according to Ms. Angie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2971)|
| 0:49:36| and that is on the resolution with regards to the CTAS money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2976)|
| 0:49:41| The resolution had stated that we would go ahead and pay those who were already underway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2981)|
| 0:49:49| And the discrepancy is we had talked about the employees, 15, and there were three office holders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2989)|
| 0:49:56| And so were the office holders involved in that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=2996)|
| 0:50:01| As it stands now, I believe, and correct me if I'm wrong, Angie, that it's the 15 employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=3001)|
| 0:50:06| Is that what the minutes are reflecting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=3006)|
| 0:50:09| Or is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=3009)|
| 0:50:10| The substitute motion just stated 15 employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=3010)|
| 0:50:13| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=3013)|
| 0:50:14| And so there were also three elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=3014)|
| 0:50:16| And so we need the clarification of that to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=3016)|
| 0:50:19| Right now it's the 15 employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=3019)|
| 0:50:21| And I could not remember the discussion as to whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=3021)|
| 0:50:24| or not we had intended to include the three elected office holders or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=3024)|
| 0:50:29| So that's why I'm asking for clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=3029)|
| 0:50:31| If anyone remembers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=3031)|
| 0:50:34| I remember distinctly the 15 employees, but I don't remember the three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=3034)|
| 0:50:37| Go ahead, Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=3037)|
| 0:50:38| Is Sherry here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=3038)|
| 0:50:43| She told me at one time that the elected office holders get their $1,500 regardless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=3043)|
| 0:50:51| It was from the state, as I recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=3051)|
| 0:50:53| Yes, from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=3053)|
| 0:50:55| So, I mean, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=3055)|
| 0:50:57| Well, that's why I'm asking for clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=3057)|
| 0:50:58| They had asked me, and I could not remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=3058)|
| 0:51:00| I just know that the 15 employees, but I don't remember what the discussion was with regards to the three office holders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=3060)|
| 0:51:06| Chris would know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=3066)|
| 0:51:09| Chris Caldwell, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=3069)|
| 0:51:11| The elected officials get an amount from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=3071)|
| 0:51:14| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=3074)|
| 0:51:15| But it differs every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=3075)|
| 0:51:17| It depends on the number of elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=3077)|
| 0:51:20| And that's divided by a total number set by the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=3080)|
| 0:51:23| I think last year they got like $1,366.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=3083)|
| 0:51:26| So it's going to vary from year to year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=3086)|
| 0:51:29| And so you probably do want to try to clarify, you know, what you mean by elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=3089)|
| 0:51:35| Because it is going to fluctuate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=3095)|
| 0:51:39| I think ours was just for the 15 employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=3099)|
| 0:51:41| That's the way it's written now, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=3101)|
| 0:51:43| And they'll be getting money from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=3103)|
| 0:51:45| So I'm guessing we leave it as is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=3105)|
| 0:51:51| Any other comments to that process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=3111)|
| 0:51:54| I think leave as is until the 15 employees and no officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=3114)|
| 0:52:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=3122)|
| 0:52:03| In the minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=3123)|
| 0:52:05| Any other discussion to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=3125)|
| 0:52:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=3127)|
| 0:52:09| Do I hear a motion then to approve the minutes as we've discussed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=3129)|
| 0:52:13| Ann?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=3133)|
| 0:52:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=3134)|
| 0:52:17| Properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=3137)|
| 0:52:18| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=3138)|
| 0:52:19| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=3139)|
| 0:52:20| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=3140)|
| 0:52:21| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=3141)|
| 0:52:22| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=3142)|
| 0:52:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=3143)|
| 0:52:24| Amendments to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=3144)|
| 0:52:25| A couple items that I've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=3145)|
| 0:52:27| First, I'd like to add a discussion item on committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=3147)|
| 0:52:32| I probably erred or misstepped a bit in the formation of one of the committees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=3152)|
| 0:52:37| or a couple of the committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=3157)|
| 0:52:39| So we'll take that up in a discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=3159)|
| 0:52:42| I would also like, and this is from discussions with finance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=3162)|
| 0:52:48| all of these items regarding appropriations, designations from our surplus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=3168)|
| 0:52:55| they really need to be taken up today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=3175)|
| 0:52:57| And so I had deferred or offered to defer the one on MPC, which is 903, item 903.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=3177)|
| 0:53:05| So I'd like to add that back in if that's not objectionable to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=3185)|
| 0:53:12| And then also all of those items are lumped together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=3192)|
| 0:53:18| and Chris might want to, Mr. Caldwell might want to speak again as he addressed us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=3198)|
| 0:53:26| because some of us weren't there at the chairman's luncheon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=3206)|
| 0:53:29| So we might have Chris do a bit of a summary again in terms of our finances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=3209)|
| 0:53:35| and how it's affected by these appropriations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=3215)|
| 0:53:40| So anyway, so we'll try to get 903, 907, 908, 909 together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=3220)|
| 0:53:45| I mean, they're together anyway in terms of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=3225)|
| 0:53:48| And then Mr. Anders, we're going to hold off on Mr. Anders' CARNS item until he's back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=3228)|
| 0:53:55| and he will be back, I think, shortly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=3235)|
| 0:53:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=3239)|
| 0:54:00| Other amendments to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=3240)|
| 0:54:03| What about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=3243)|
| 0:54:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=3244)|
| 0:54:05| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=3245)|
| 0:54:06| Lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=3246)|
| 0:54:07| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=3247)|
| 0:54:08| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=3248)|
| 0:54:10| And we probably need to hear these together, but I'd like to add 911, and it deals with 909.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=3250)|
| 0:54:19| It deals with the funding policy of what I asked the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=3259)|
| 0:54:24| So if we could kind of lump those two together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=3264)|
| 0:54:27| So I'd like to add 911.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=3267)|
| 0:54:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=3269)|
| 0:54:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=3270)|
| 0:54:31| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=3271)|
| 0:54:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=3273)|
| 0:54:34| I would put it on our discussion about the RFP for audit services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=3274)|
| 0:54:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=3283)|
| 0:54:44| We've got an item to add the discussion of the RFP for our internal auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=3284)|
| 0:54:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=3291)|
| 0:54:52| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=3292)|

| 1:08:28| On the first slot, I was going to fill in Mary Kaiser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4108)|
| 1:08:32| She's been with us for four years, and another lady got very high marks, I think roughly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4112)|
| 1:08:40| equal to Mary's, but for the sake of continuity, I would nominate Mary Kaiser to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4120)|
| 1:08:46| And I do not have any personal knowledge about Dr. Casella, if he's going to stay or go or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4126)|

| 1:09:08| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4148)|
| 1:09:09| Do we hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4149)|
| 1:09:10| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4150)|

| 1:09:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4183)|
| 1:09:44| Go back to page 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4184)|
| 1:09:50| This is Resolution 802.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4190)|
| 1:09:55| A resolution determining the method of disposal of four, well, it will be three properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4195)|

| 1:10:17| and rezoned according to its highest and best use prior to its sale by public auction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4217)|
| 1:10:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4224)|
| 1:10:25| Mr. Brown made the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4225)|
| 1:10:26| Mr. Hammond seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4226)|
| 1:10:28| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4228)|
| 1:10:29| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4229)|
| 1:10:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4230)|
| 1:10:31| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4231)|
| 1:10:32| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4232)|
| 1:10:35| On page 11, Resolution 901 withholding disbursements to Knox County Area Chamber Partnership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4235)|
| 1:10:45| Inc., until requested financial disclosures are provided to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4245)|
| 1:10:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4249)|
| 1:10:50| This is mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4250)|
| 1:10:51| And I'm going to, hopefully, this will be appealing to the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4251)|
| 1:10:58| At every point in this process where we've been in discussion about what the Chamber's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4258)|
| 1:11:05| obligation is in terms of the public's right to know and disclosure of financial information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4265)|
| 1:11:11| I've been in conference, consultation with the law director and the deputy law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4271)|
| 1:11:17| And so there was never a step where I didn't review that thoroughly with them and seek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4277)|
| 1:11:23| their approval and consult with them in every part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4283)|
| 1:11:28| I think, without a doubt, there has been from records, their 990s, from all types of records that they have submitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4288)|
| 1:11:41| that there has been a mixture of the funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4301)|
| 1:11:45| And if we really, if we look back at the contract language, what we're really justified in doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4305)|
| 1:11:52| or were justified in doing in the previous year and the previous contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4312)|
| 1:11:57| we were justified in terminating the contract, not just withholding funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4317)|
| 1:12:03| I greatly appreciate the work of Mr. Lay and Chris Caldwell and last week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4323)|
| 1:12:13| and what they did when they went over to the Chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4333)|
| 1:12:15| The Chamber was very forthcoming in providing the information that they needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4335)|
| 1:12:22| And I also appreciate the law director and deputy law director's work as to addressing the legal issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4342)|
| 1:12:31| that Mr. McAdams presented us with at the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4351)|
| 1:12:37| And, by the way, you received from the law director responses to each one of the contentions that Mr. McAdams made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4357)|
| 1:12:48| And if you've had time to review those, what you'll note is that basically all of them were rebutted by the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4368)|
| 1:12:56| And so, but irregardless, I think that it is, we've got an opportunity here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4376)|
| 1:13:06| and certainly I have an opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4386)|
| 1:13:08| You know, this history of three years of squabbling over issues that started with the Ridgetop Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4388)|
| 1:13:14| and now has branched over into the school budget and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4394)|
| 1:13:20| I think there's some, you know, for me to hang on to this is a bit of, I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4400)|
| 1:13:28| it's a continuation of something that I think we need to put behind us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4408)|
| 1:13:32| And so because of the willingness of the chamber to respond to some of the requests that we made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4412)|
| 1:13:43| not completely in exactly the categories that I asked for, but they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4423)|
| 1:13:49| And, obviously, they've set up another bank account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4429)|
| 1:13:52| They're willing to do business in a different way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4432)|
| 1:13:55| So they're changing how they're going to go forward in terms of whatever it is that they, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4435)|
| 1:14:02| these items that they call issues advocacy or we would, I think most all of us would call it a political effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4442)|
| 1:14:12| But they are changing the way they want to do things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4452)|
| 1:14:16| And so because of that, I feel like it might be in the best interest of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4456)|
| 1:14:24| Certainly in the best interest of the chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4464)|
| 1:14:27| And my own personal wish to avoid more confrontation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4467)|
| 1:14:34| Sometimes I feel like George McFly, back to the future part one, great philosopher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4474)|
| 1:14:41| Anyway, he said, I'm just not good at confrontation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4481)|
| 1:14:48| But given those things and the hope that we've got some really important and large issues in terms of the chamber| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4488)|
| 1:14:59| being involved in entrepreneurial activities and education, just in a spirit of hopefulness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4499)|
| 1:15:07| I'd like to offer somewhat of the olive branch and withdraw this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4507)|
| 1:15:17| So if that is pleasing to the body, I would entertain a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4517)|
| 1:15:23| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4523)|
| 1:15:24| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4524)|
| 1:15:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4525)|
| 1:15:26| And Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4526)|
| 1:15:27| Well, I have my light on to make the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4527)|
| 1:15:29| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4529)|
| 1:15:30| But I didn't flash my button.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4530)|
| 1:15:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4532)|
| 1:15:35| We've got to keep you to that, Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4535)|
| 1:15:37| Would you like to say anything, Mr. Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4537)|
| 1:15:39| Yes, I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4539)|
| 1:15:40| Go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4540)|
| 1:15:41| Since I've got the light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4541)|
| 1:15:46| Last Monday we charged our finance department to go and take a look,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4546)|
| 1:15:50| and the chamber graciously agreed to let them do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4550)|
| 1:15:55| We have a letter from the finance department that everything they saw was in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4555)|
| 1:16:01| So I would concur with the motion, and I'll third it if it needs a third, to go ahead and pay this money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4561)|
| 1:16:10| As I said last week, the ones we're hurting in this are the business community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4570)|
| 1:16:17| the guys out here that we're expecting to bring business to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4577)|
| 1:16:20| It's saying we don't trust you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4580)|
| 1:16:21| Folks, we need them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4581)|
| 1:16:23| So let's put, as Tony says, let's put this behind us and go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4583)|
| 1:16:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4588)|
| 1:16:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4589)|
| 1:16:30| We've got the motion in second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4590)|
| 1:16:31| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4591)|
| 1:16:32| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4592)|
| 1:16:33| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4593)|
| 1:16:34| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4594)|
| 1:16:37| Good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4597)|
| 1:16:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4600)|
| 1:16:41| On page 11, resolution 903, designating, committing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4601)|
| 1:16:46| and procuring funds in the amount of $100,000 from fiscal year 2012 to fiscal year 2013| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4606)|
| 1:16:52| for the purpose of restoring that portion of the FY13 operation budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4612)|
| 1:16:57| for the Metropolitan Planning Commission provided by Knox County to the level of funding provided in FY12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4617)|
| 1:17:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4624)|
| 1:17:05| And thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4625)|
| 1:17:06| I would also like to add that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4626)|
| 1:17:08| just based on this is the first item of all the items that we're going to discuss about appropriations from our surplus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4628)|
| 1:17:16| And as was discussed by Mr. Donaldson a few weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4636)|
| 1:17:25| this affects his budget in terms of personnel and employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4645)|
| 1:17:30| So there are people that are losing their jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4650)|
| 1:17:33| and the kinds of cuts that they have to make in terms of his department really hurts the development community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4653)|
| 1:17:43| because of delays and understaffing and so on and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4663)|
| 1:17:48| I appreciated the new Sentinels editorial yesterday in support of the restoration of this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4668)|
| 1:17:57| So, anyway, that's the reason why I'm bringing it forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4677)|
| 1:18:03| Could we hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4683)|
| 1:18:07| I'll second the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4687)|
| 1:18:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4688)|
| 1:18:09| I have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4689)|
| 1:18:10| Discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4690)|
| 1:18:11| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4691)|
| 1:18:12| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4692)|
| 1:18:13| Chris, can you come down real quick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4693)|
| 1:18:14| A question about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4694)|
| 1:18:22| This $100,000, was that from funding for the hillside?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4702)|
| 1:18:25| What is this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4705)|
| 1:18:26| What did they use that money for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4706)|
| 1:18:29| Or is it just general money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4709)|
| 1:18:31| Or Mr. Donaldson just?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4711)|
| 1:18:33| Operating funds is what they would use it for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4713)|
| 1:18:36| Basically, city and county both give them a lump sum of money each fiscal year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4716)|
| 1:18:42| and then they incorporate that in their budget and spend it as they so choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4722)|
| 1:18:49| And so, during our budget process, we did, in fact, I think reduced MPC's budget by $100,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4729)|
| 1:18:59| But we gave them money for the hillside slope protection, did we not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4739)|
| 1:19:03| Did we not give them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4743)|
| 1:19:04| I know they had some extra employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4744)|
| 1:19:06| Mark's sitting there shaking his head, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4746)|
| 1:19:09| I thought we funded a couple of staff positions to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4749)|
| 1:19:13| Mark Donaldson, Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4753)|
| 1:19:16| We received no incremental funds from either the county or the city with regard to our work supporting the task force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4756)|
| 1:19:24| on the hillside and ridgetop protection plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4764)|
| 1:19:29| The $100,000 represents two unfilled positions, one in our addressing department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4769)|
| 1:19:37| and the other in our GIS department, where we had retirements towards the end of last fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4777)|
| 1:19:44| Our request, initial request for $656,000 for this fiscal year reflected hiring people to fill those two positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4784)|
| 1:19:54| As a result of the decrease, we have not been able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4794)|
| 1:19:58| So those two positions remain empty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4798)|
| 1:20:03| But you didn't have that in your budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4803)|
| 1:20:06| You know that you had it in our request for $656,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4806)|
| 1:20:12| The budget you passed was for $556,000, a $100,000 decrease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4812)|
| 1:20:19| When that was approved, we were unable to have the funds to fill those two positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4819)|
| 1:20:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4829)|
| 1:20:30| Mr. Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4830)|
| 1:20:31| Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4831)|
| 1:20:32| Why is it necessary to fill these positions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4832)|
| 1:20:34| You said one is addressing and one is GIS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4834)|
| 1:20:38| Our addressing department, which three years ago included three people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4838)|
| 1:20:46| and today has only one person in it full time, certifies and assigns 20,000 to 30,000 addresses each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4846)|
| 1:20:57| A lot of the certifications revolve around building permits and financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4857)|
| 1:21:06| And a very small increment of that lately has been with new addresses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4866)|
| 1:21:10| But the certifications remain very strong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4870)|
| 1:21:14| As a result of not being able to fill one of those positions, we've had to take people from other jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4874)|
| 1:21:21| Their work piles up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4881)|
| 1:21:22| The time delay with regard to certifying and assigning new addresses increases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4882)|
| 1:21:30| People get caught in that time warp between getting a permit and getting an address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4890)|
| 1:21:35| and getting their letters of certification and getting a new loan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4895)|
| 1:21:42| or any other legal document that requires a legal address certification that creates a delay for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4902)|
| 1:21:52| On the GIS position, it has created a delay in an increased time in updating the various layers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4912)|
| 1:22:05| within the GIS system that we were responsible for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4925)|
| 1:22:09| The zoning, the planning, the parcel and lot data and right-of-way data we maintain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4929)|
| 1:22:18| and it just creates a backlog of work there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4938)|
| 1:22:22| So these will be recurring funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4942)|
| 1:22:24| If you hire individuals, then next year's budget will reflect the fact that you've hired two additional people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4944)|
| 1:22:29| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4949)|
| 1:22:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4951)|
| 1:22:34| Mr. Burwells.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4954)|
| 1:22:37| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4957)|
| 1:22:39| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4959)|
| 1:22:41| But I guess similar to that, you had these two positions in this year's budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4961)|
| 1:22:46| and it wasn't funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4966)|
| 1:22:48| So that's always an option for next year as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4968)|
| 1:22:51| If those positions, the mayor sends us a budget minus those two positions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4971)|
| 1:22:58| we can vote that up or down as well, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4978)|
| 1:23:01| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4981)|
| 1:23:02| Our request would always be to continue to have those if the work is warranted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4982)|
| 1:23:08| We feel it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4988)|
| 1:23:10| In terms of the two-year cycle, how much has your budget been decreased?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4990)|
| 1:23:17| Over the last two years, the amount of revenue has been decreased by $200,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=4997)|
| 1:23:26| and in turn the county is charging us nearly $200,000 for space costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5006)|
| 1:23:33| and central services that we did not incur before that two years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5013)|
| 1:23:38| So the net bottom line is almost $400,000 down from two years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5018)|
| 1:23:44| I just think that's key.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5024)|
| 1:23:47| I have one other thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5027)|
| 1:23:50| Maybe look to the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5030)|
| 1:23:53| And Mr. Donaldson made me brought to my thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5033)|
| 1:23:58| I have a question about salaries and freezes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5038)|
| 1:24:02| Is it better to but it's not really related to this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5042)|
| 1:24:06| Should I ask to have some added as a discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5046)|
| 1:24:10| It shouldn't take a long time, but you never know with these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5050)|
| 1:24:13| So I don't know how I should handle it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5053)|
| 1:24:15| Should I ask now or I'm looking, I guess, to both the chair and the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5055)|
| 1:24:19| But, again, it's more countywide for how we deal with a hiring freeze is my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5059)|
| 1:24:27| So it may be better to bring that up as for a discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5067)|
| 1:24:31| We'll add that as a discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5071)|
| 1:24:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5073)|
| 1:24:36| Ms. Brules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5076)|
| 1:24:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5077)|
| 1:24:38| So, Mark, the bottom line, I think, in this is that as you were talking about what these two positions do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5078)|
| 1:24:47| anyone who goes on to GIS, and that's any of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5087)|
| 1:24:51| I know I go on KGIS a lot, and so do other people in my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5091)|
| 1:24:56| to look at current information on variances, zonings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5096)|
| 1:25:01| or anything that's happening in our neighborhood or close to our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5101)|
| 1:25:05| So that's not going to be updated in a timely manner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5105)|
| 1:25:07| which means that constituents could get the wrong information or incorrect information, not updated information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5107)|
| 1:25:14| And if there's a delay in verifying addresses, then they could have their possibly loans delayed, other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5114)|
| 1:25:21| So, really, this could lead to a delay in constituent services, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5121)|
| 1:25:29| That's correct for both positions, the addressing and the GIS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5129)|
| 1:25:34| And with regards to the GIS position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5134)|
| 1:25:37| it has hampered our ability to do something that over the last four or five years we've been very successful at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5137)|
| 1:25:45| is to go out and get additional work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5145)|
| 1:25:48| We've contracted with organizations like CAT, the Development Corporation, and places like that, to do mapping for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5148)|
| 1:25:56| and we just don't have the capacity to do that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5156)|
| 1:25:59| So that's yet another constituent service that's not being met as a result of this open position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5159)|
| 1:26:06| I think a lot of people don't really understand what MPC is responsible for and what they do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5166)|
| 1:26:13| but I think that we're supposed to be in the business of constituent services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5173)|
| 1:26:19| I know that's important to all of us that are sitting up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5179)|
| 1:26:22| And I think we've had so many cuts that we're hitting the point of where we've cut so much that it's going to start,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5182)|
| 1:26:33| we're going to start getting more and more phone calls from constituents saying it's taking too long to get this done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5193)|
| 1:26:38| it's taking too long to get that done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5198)|
| 1:26:41| And that's what I see going on with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5201)|
| 1:26:43| So I'm very much in support of reinstating this $100,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5203)|
| 1:26:50| Again, they're still going to be down $400,000 or, I'm sorry, $300,000 from two years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5210)|
| 1:26:58| So I think that this is one of those points where we've cut so far that we're starting to hit bone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5218)|
| 1:27:03| and it's not in anyone's best interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5223)|
| 1:27:06| Thank you, Ms. Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5226)|
| 1:27:08| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5228)|
| 1:27:09| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5229)|
| 1:27:10| I just want to just address, I guess, the other commissioners on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5230)|
| 1:27:13| This is just another item that we're doing, and it's not during budget time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5233)|
| 1:27:17| We've got budget cycle that we can look at this because this is ongoing expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5237)|
| 1:27:23| And two things, in Mark's department, you know, we all know construction is really, really low right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5243)|
| 1:27:28| So I don't know just how busy staff is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5248)|
| 1:27:31| We've only got like five or six items on the agenda for zonings tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5251)|
| 1:27:35| And the second thing is they're a fee-based office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5255)|
| 1:27:38| They can also increase fees if they need to, if they felt that a position needed to be filled really bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5258)|
| 1:27:45| I'm for the positions, Mark, what you're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5265)|
| 1:27:48| but I just think that we need to do it during budget time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5268)|
| 1:27:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5273)|
| 1:27:54| Other Ms. Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5274)|
| 1:27:57| I just wanted to refresh everyone's memory that during budget time we tried to do a lot of these things at that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5277)|
| 1:28:05| and we as a group decided to put it off because we weren't sure exactly what the bottom line was going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5285)|
| 1:28:12| And finance encouraged us to wait, and we agreed as a body that we would wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5292)|
| 1:28:16| Otherwise, these things would have been brought at that time, and we would have done them then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5296)|
| 1:28:20| But that's been a couple of months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5300)|
| 1:28:22| So I think everybody would prefer for these to be done during budget time, but there was a reason why it wasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5302)|
| 1:28:29| Any other things you'd like to say, Mr. Donaldson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5309)|
| 1:28:33| No, I think you've got a flavor for where we're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5313)|
| 1:28:38| Just to remind you that five years ago at the beginning of the recession we had 44 people on staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5318)|
| 1:28:45| Today we have 36.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5325)|
| 1:28:47| So we've shouldered more than our share of the workforce cuts over the last few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5327)|
| 1:28:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5334)|
| 1:28:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5335)|
| 1:28:56| Seeing no further lights, we have a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5336)|
| 1:29:00| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5340)|

| 1:31:14| I have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5474)|
| 1:31:15| Ms. Broyles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5475)|
| 1:31:16| I need to strike from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5476)|
| 1:31:20| On page 2 of the resolution, it says, shall be used for transporting disabled senior citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5480)|
| 1:31:26| throughout Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5486)|
| 1:31:28| And I want to strike the word disabled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5488)|
| 1:31:30| That should be all senior citizens, not only those who are disabled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5490)|
| 1:31:35| Other than that, there's no changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5495)|
| 1:31:39| And I want to make sure everybody, I had Jolie pass out a copy of something that came| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5499)|
| 1:31:48| out just recently, some new research that shows that bus passes for senior citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5508)|
| 1:31:53| actually have a health benefit, which is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5513)|
| 1:31:57| And I hope that everyone saw last night on Channel 10 did a great job highlighting how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5517)|
| 1:32:07| important this is for our seniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5527)|
| 1:32:10| It's very important to me, as I was working on this, to realize that most of our senior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5530)|
| 1:32:15| citizens are not new residents to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5535)|
| 1:32:19| I think for the most part, they have lived here for decades, if not for their entire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5539)|
| 1:32:24| lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5544)|
| 1:32:25| They have paid into the system that the schools that we've attended and that our children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5545)|
| 1:32:34| attend were paid for or expanded or refurbished with their tax dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5554)|
| 1:32:41| The roads that we drive on were constructed and paved with their tax dollars and continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5561)|
| 1:32:46| to be because all of these seniors still pay taxes in to Knox County, either in the form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5566)|
| 1:32:51| of property taxes or sales taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5571)|
| 1:32:57| And for county residents who live inside the city limits, even if they do all their shopping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5577)|
| 1:33:03| within the city limits, 72% of the city sales tax goes to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5583)|
| 1:33:09| So this is something that I feel like these seniors have earned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5589)|
| 1:33:14| And it's also when I got MPC to put some data together for me, and in District 1, there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5594)|
| 1:33:23| are 4,810 senior citizens that live within the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5603)|
| 1:33:30| In District 3, there's 5,588 senior citizens that reside in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5610)|
| 1:33:37| In District 4, there's 6,953 senior citizens that live within the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5617)|
| 1:33:45| District 5, there's 6,243.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5625)|
| 1:33:48| In District 6, there's 6,021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5628)|
| 1:33:52| In District 7, there are 7,042 senior citizens that reside within the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5632)|
| 1:34:01| In District 8, there's 6,685.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5641)|
| 1:34:05| And in District 9, there's 5,586.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5645)|
| 1:34:08| Now, countywide, that's about 13% of Knox County's residents, and that number is only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5648)|
| 1:34:14| going to go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5654)|
| 1:34:16| Every year, the boomers are aging, and pretty soon, for some of us, sooner than later, we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5656)|
| 1:34:23| going to be including ourselves in that demographic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5663)|
| 1:34:27| So this is something that's very important, I think, for the health and well-being of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5667)|
| 1:34:32| our senior citizens, and I don't see any reason why we should not be doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5672)|
| 1:34:40| It's not a recurring expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5680)|
| 1:34:43| I understand that this will have to go through the budget process again next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5683)|
| 1:34:47| We're fine with that, but we can afford to do this now, and we can help thousands of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5687)|
| 1:34:52| senior citizens now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5692)|
| 1:34:54| And we should do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5694)|
| 1:34:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5696)|
| 1:34:57| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5697)|
| 1:34:58| Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5698)|
| 1:35:02| Okay, Mr. Chairman, I see the Barbers are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5702)|
| 1:35:05| Could I ask you some questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5705)|
| 1:35:16| Name and address, please, Barber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5716)|
| 1:35:18| Barber Kelly with CAC 2247 Western Avenue, and Barber Monte is also here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5718)|
| 1:35:25| At our discussion, we had talked, you had given us a number of figures and numbers on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5725)|
| 1:35:30| the increased number of visits that you would be able to provide with these additional funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5730)|
| 1:35:36| and we talked about the fact that, I believe it was Tenova or one of the firms were not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5736)|
| 1:35:42| able to continue with the funding, and that was to the tune of, what, $200,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5742)|
| 1:35:47| So that's $200,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5747)|
| 1:35:49| Is it possible for you, if we pass this, to provide us, like, a quarterly update on how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5749)|
| 1:35:54| many visits that you were able to provide, the number of people that you were able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5754)|
| 1:35:59| service, so that we can get a feel for, you know, just how many visits that you've done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5759)|
| 1:36:08| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5768)|
| 1:36:09| We can provide you pretty much any level of information that you would like about numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5769)|
| 1:36:16| of trips, miles, numbers of different individuals served, the characteristics of those individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5776)|
| 1:36:24| I think all of the above would be very helpful, because, again, if it passes, if we move forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5784)|
| 1:36:29| if you could just do that maybe on a quarterly basis, just so we know, so we have it, and we, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5789)|
| 1:36:35| because if people ask us about it, we can say, well, these are the number of seniors or others| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5795)|
| 1:36:39| that we were able to service with these additional funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5799)|
| 1:36:42| We are set up to provide that type of information, because a lot of our billing is done on that basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5802)|
| 1:36:48| And so we'd be happy to provide that in whatever level of detail you'd like to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5808)|
| 1:36:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5815)|
| 1:36:57| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5817)|
| 1:37:00| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5820)|
| 1:37:04| You know, I'd like to give a little bit of a recent kind of experience, last testimony,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5824)|
| 1:37:13| because I speak in favor of this resolution, and it's not to pander to anything else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5833)|
| 1:37:18| but it really is just to illustrate, one, how important this resolution is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5838)|
| 1:37:25| and how it really does go to, I won't say take care of, but continue to work with, build up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5845)|
| 1:37:36| provide those basic services for our constituents, and that's dealing with my father.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5856)|
| 1:37:43| Today we had a podiatrist visit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5863)|
| 1:37:47| You know, we're able to pay for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5867)|
| 1:37:50| We wouldn't meet these guidelines, but it's difficult to get from East Knoxville to Knox Avenue off of Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5870)|
| 1:37:58| That's a difficult thing to do for a senior, even an active senior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5878)|
| 1:38:05| It really is difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5885)|
| 1:38:07| This, to me, you know, just continues that quality of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5887)|
| 1:38:13| Is a podiatrist, is that a life or death kind of situation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5893)|
| 1:38:17| No, but, you know, for a diabetic it can be very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5897)|
| 1:38:20| For a person that wants to get out and move around, foot care is vital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5900)|
| 1:38:26| So something, you know, I won't say it's simple, but something as, you know, non-core, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5906)|
| 1:38:31| it's not pulmonary, it's not cardiovascular or anything like that, but it really is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5911)|
| 1:38:37| it just illustrated to me how important these dollars are to help those constituents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5917)|
| 1:38:44| that can't otherwise get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5924)|
| 1:38:46| As we talked about a lot last month, there is no transportation piece, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5926)|
| 1:38:53| that's a core function of, you know, the basic health care out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5933)|
| 1:38:58| So unless you have a really, you know, kind of nice Cadillac plan, it doesn't provide for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5938)|
| 1:39:03| So, you know, again, as we deliberate over these things, let's make sure that we're keeping our focus on, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5943)|
| 1:39:13| why are we here, what are we doing, what benefit is this to our constituents?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5953)|
| 1:39:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5960)|
| 1:39:21| Thank you, Ms. Merwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5961)|
| 1:39:22| Barbara and Barbara, you all can break that out by zip code also, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5962)|
| 1:39:26| We can break it out by zip code or by district, however you'd like to have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5966)|
| 1:39:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5971)|
| 1:39:32| Would you all like to have it by district or by zip code?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5972)|
| 1:39:34| Does it matter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5974)|
| 1:39:36| Zip code is easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5976)|
| 1:39:37| Zip code?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5977)|
| 1:39:38| Let's do zip code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5978)|
| 1:39:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5979)|
| 1:39:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5981)|
| 1:39:42| Mr. Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5982)|
| 1:39:43| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5983)|
| 1:39:44| I want to just comment on this one briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5984)|
| 1:39:46| It's a tough one for me because I would like to put half a million dollars away in our rainy day fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5986)|
| 1:39:55| I still have a fear that we've hit a blip in our tax collections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=5995)|
| 1:40:03| the state giving us more home income tax money than we're going to get next year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6003)|
| 1:40:08| because of some things that were addressed in our chairman's lunch from Mr. Caldwell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6008)|
| 1:40:13| and also, as we know, possibly a blip in the bump up in the sales tax collections due to the storms of April and June of 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6013)|
| 1:40:25| Nevertheless, I will support this, but under the stipulation, I feel naive saying this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6025)|
| 1:40:34| but under the stipulation, it's a non-recurring expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6034)|
| 1:40:36| To say it's not going to come back next year, I'm not that naive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6036)|
| 1:40:40| It will be back next year, but nevertheless, I'm going to support it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6040)|
| 1:40:44| putting that qualifier on it that it's a non-recurring expense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6044)|
| 1:40:47| and I hope we can find a Tenova or a Cigna or a Blue Cross or somebody in the meantime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6047)|
| 1:40:52| to underwrite these trips as has happened in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6052)|
| 1:40:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6056)|
| 1:40:57| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6057)|
| 1:40:58| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6058)|
| 1:41:00| I have to apologize to the previous thing that was on the floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6060)|
| 1:41:05| because I was back under my desk digging in the newspaper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6065)|
| 1:41:09| I had to get out my, well, they call it an astrograph, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6069)|
| 1:41:18| My horoscope for today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6078)|
| 1:41:21| Financial trends look to be encouraging, not necessarily in terms of making additional money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6081)|
| 1:41:30| but for more effective use of resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6090)|
| 1:41:34| I don't know why my wife laid that out for me today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6094)|
| 1:41:37| I don't believe it had anything to do with what we're discussing right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6097)|
| 1:41:40| but I do see a connection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6100)|
| 1:41:43| The administration took upon itself at our direction gathering information about the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6103)|
| 1:41:49| They started in January, February, March, somewhere along in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6109)|
| 1:41:54| We commission set for a couple of months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6114)|
| 1:41:58| and talked about things that we're right now talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6118)|
| 1:42:01| so that people will know exactly maybe where I'm coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6121)|
| 1:42:05| We're dealing with a budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6125)|
| 1:42:08| A budget is kind of an imprecise operation that's dealing with past experiences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6128)|
| 1:42:20| for our best credible estimate of what the future might hold for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6140)|
| 1:42:24| Now, what the budget is in comparison to something else like maybe a recipe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6144)|
| 1:42:33| with a recipe we use a half cup of this and two tablespoons of that and a quart of milk and make something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6153)|
| 1:42:42| It's a precise thing, a recipe to get us to an end that we will be happy with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6162)|
| 1:42:51| I only say that because I want us to really consider budgeting versus what we're trying to do now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6171)|
| 1:43:00| I think we're trying to back up and fix things that we studied for four months in front of the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6180)|
| 1:43:06| The budget is already three months old, July, August, and September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6186)|
| 1:43:12| Is this $500,000 replacing a $200,000 shortfall being discounted now for nine months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6192)|
| 1:43:20| Or are we really talking about $500,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6200)|
| 1:43:23| I'm not wanting to discuss the merits of any of the things that are currently before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6203)|
| 1:43:31| because I think there are things that we discussed in the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6211)|
| 1:43:34| or things that we maybe didn't discuss in the budget process that didn't receive much traction then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6214)|
| 1:43:41| And really, I have to go with what I'm getting phone calls about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6221)|
| 1:43:46| The budget has been passed and we're faced with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6226)|
| 1:43:51| And at the audit committee, I believe we saw we had $3.5 million of surplus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6231)|
| 1:43:59| Or maybe at the last workshop we had $2.9 million worth of surplus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6239)|
| 1:44:04| Or now we're down to 2.1 or 1.9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6244)|
| 1:44:10| And I think I heard today that our July sales tax receipts are $875,000 or $900,000 short of year over year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6250)|
| 1:44:25| So I can't discuss the merits of the five or six requests that are before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6265)|
| 1:44:36| because I think they're items that need to be covered in the budget process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6276)|
| 1:44:41| That's my one time giving this speech.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6281)|
| 1:44:43| It's my passes and my no's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6283)|
| 1:44:45| They're all related to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6285)|
| 1:44:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6289)|
| 1:44:51| Mr. Caldwell, Hugh, I know you were waiting to speak as well, so go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6291)|
| 1:44:57| Hugh Hull, 1000 North Central.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6297)|
| 1:45:00| Because this contract is what we've called a defined services contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6300)|
| 1:45:06| after some conversation with the mayor, we feel that it or we would feel more comfortable, let's say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6306)|
| 1:45:14| if we competed these services because the county, over the years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6314)|
| 1:45:19| has set a precedent in competing transportation services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6319)|
| 1:45:24| We do it for the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6324)|
| 1:45:27| And there's no reason that CAC Transportation couldn't submit a bid as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6327)|
| 1:45:32| But we are talking about a half a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6332)|
| 1:45:35| So I just wanted to put that out there because it is a defined services contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6335)|
| 1:45:41| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6341)|
| 1:45:43| Ms. Rawls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6343)|
| 1:45:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6345)|
| 1:45:46| I want to, talking about this during the budget, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6346)|
| 1:45:51| we had a resolution that we passed on consent asking for more exact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6351)|
| 1:45:56| and updated figures from finance on a more regular basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6356)|
| 1:46:00| I think a lot of our discussion and debate during the budget time would have been different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6360)|
| 1:46:06| if that had been in place at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6366)|
| 1:46:11| I also feel that, and again, we had talked about all this at budget time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6371)|
| 1:46:16| and were requested to put it off for a few months until we got the final bottom line, which we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6376)|
| 1:46:22| So this could have been handled earlier, but we were specifically asked not to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6382)|
| 1:46:28| I also want to point out that Ed, questions about recurring expenses are a concern for all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6388)|
| 1:46:36| And the way that federal dollars are being allocated to transportation is changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6396)|
| 1:46:44| And so next year there will be a completely different funding mechanism in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6404)|
| 1:46:48| which hopefully will make this unnecessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6408)|
| 1:46:51| So this is truly a one-time undertaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6411)|
| 1:46:55| I understand about bidding out, but I also feel like we've got people who are hurting right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6415)|
| 1:47:02| And this is something that we can do right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6422)|
| 1:47:05| If we bid it out, it's going to delay this for months more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6425)|
| 1:47:09| This is something that we can do, and we can do it right now, and we can do it for our constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6429)|
| 1:47:14| And it's going to impact the lives of thousands of Knox County seniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6434)|
| 1:47:19| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6439)|
| 1:47:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6443)|
| 1:47:24| Mr. Armstrong, you wanted to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6444)|
| 1:47:27| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6447)|
| 1:47:28| Generally speaking, well, number one, if this is a defined services contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6448)|
| 1:47:34| then we're going to need some specificity as to what we're really paying for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6454)|
| 1:47:37| and how it's going to be measured and how the law department can actually do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6457)|
| 1:47:42| And it has been brought to our attention, and that's true,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6462)|
| 1:47:46| that I don't know of one that has not at least been an invitation for bid when we have this kind of an issue come before Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6466)|
| 1:47:58| I can't definitively say right now that it's required,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6478)|
| 1:48:01| but we'll be setting a precedent outside the norm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6481)|
| 1:48:05| And I'm sure that, you know, I would advise that we probably send out an invitation for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6485)|
| 1:48:13| I know it's where we sit today, but I think it's in the best interest of Knox County to do that, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6493)|
| 1:48:21| That's my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6501)|
| 1:48:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6503)|
| 1:48:24| Mr. McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6504)|
| 1:48:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6505)|
| 1:48:26| I won't speak to the RFP process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6506)|
| 1:48:30| I will defer to those who know and who do this daily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6510)|
| 1:48:42| You know, this is amazing, the conversations that we have over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6522)|
| 1:48:50| Over the last two years, it is absolutely unbelievable, the conversations that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6530)|
| 1:48:58| You have a great month in sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6538)|
| 1:49:03| That's one month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6543)|
| 1:49:05| Mayor's staff will come up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6545)|
| 1:49:06| Finance folks will come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6546)|
| 1:49:07| That's one month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6547)|
| 1:49:08| One month, there's not a trend made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6548)|
| 1:49:11| That's one month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6551)|
| 1:49:12| Slow down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6552)|
| 1:49:13| There's this reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6553)|
| 1:49:14| Always, you know, how sales tax, I mean, comes in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6554)|
| 1:49:17| It was just after Christmas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6557)|
| 1:49:18| We have those conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6558)|
| 1:49:21| Then we have another month that is bad at a time that we kind of know would be bad for whatever reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6561)|
| 1:49:27| And then we'll have the same conversation on the other side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6567)|
| 1:49:31| It blows my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6571)|
| 1:49:35| The superintendent did a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6575)|
| 1:49:37| I don't know if anyone heard him last week, but he gave us a great chart that told the truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6577)|
| 1:49:42| Sometimes it's above projections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6582)|
| 1:49:44| Sometimes it's below projections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6584)|
| 1:49:47| We patted the superintendent and his financial staff on the back last week about the spreadsheet that they created,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6587)|
| 1:49:56| that they've been using for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6596)|
| 1:50:00| And it showed times in red, times in black, trending upward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6600)|
| 1:50:05| Did we ignore that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6605)|
| 1:50:07| The superintendent and the school board came with some flat-out recurring costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6607)|
| 1:50:12| some costs that Commissioner Brown, you know, pulled back on because, hey, we don't want recurring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6612)|
| 1:50:17| They gave everyone a 2% raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6617)|
| 1:50:19| You call it what you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6619)|
| 1:50:21| Their health insurance increased, but it's a 2% raise because they understand trends and trends analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6621)|
| 1:50:28| Oh, July was bad, so we have to stop the whole process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6628)|
| 1:50:35| March, let's not think about budgets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6635)|
| 1:50:38| That's what we were told.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6638)|
| 1:50:40| Leave us alone until the end of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6640)|
| 1:50:43| That's what we were told.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6643)|
| 1:50:45| Bottom line, you can't paint it any other way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6645)|
| 1:50:49| And then we're getting beat up for not continuing to ask questions after you told us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6649)|
| 1:50:54| leave it alone until the end of the year and we'll get back with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6654)|
| 1:50:59| And we're getting beat up for, well, we should have dug into it then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6659)|
| 1:51:03| We did the same thing with the, you know, schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6663)|
| 1:51:06| Whose budget is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6666)|
| 1:51:07| And I'll ask this question every year that I sit here when we pull out the rubber stamps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6667)|
| 1:51:12| Whose budget is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6672)|
| 1:51:14| It's our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6674)|
| 1:51:15| Are we going to talk about it then or are we going to talk about it now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6675)|
| 1:51:20| We've got to talk about it sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6680)|
| 1:51:21| I'm fine to talk about it then at the budget process, but that's not what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6681)|
| 1:51:34| I just wish we played the same rules year-round.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6694)|
| 1:51:39| Last year this time we were having a school board retreat during this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6699)|
| 1:51:45| And the same thing came up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6705)|
| 1:51:48| Well, do we need to talk about this during budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6708)|
| 1:51:50| We don't need to talk about this stuff now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6710)|
| 1:51:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6713)|
| 1:51:54| Well, at some point we're going to have to figure out how we do business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6714)|
| 1:51:59| We've got to own our share of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6719)|
| 1:52:02| The budget's ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6722)|
| 1:52:04| It's not the mayor's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6724)|
| 1:52:05| It's not the finance department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6725)|
| 1:52:06| It's not anyone's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6726)|
| 1:52:08| Now, we need to be in compliance and we need to be conservative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6728)|
| 1:52:11| And that's what we've been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6731)|
| 1:52:12| That's why we have the highest rainy day fund ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6732)|
| 1:52:15| That's why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6735)|
| 1:52:17| That's why we came up whether it'll dip down or not, a double dip recession.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6737)|
| 1:52:25| To me, it's not germane to this conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6745)|
| 1:52:28| We bottomed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6748)|
| 1:52:32| So unless someone can get up here and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6752)|
| 1:52:34| We're going to definitely stop having money to spend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6754)|
| 1:52:37| I do not see the state running around scared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6757)|
| 1:52:41| They are sales tax dependent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6761)|
| 1:52:44| I see the governor of this great state out here taking care of the rural communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6764)|
| 1:52:52| That's what I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6772)|
| 1:52:53| They got the same numbers in July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6773)|
| 1:52:55| That's where we got our numbers from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6775)|
| 1:52:56| So, please, let's not take one month and we've changed the whole conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6776)|
| 1:53:03| In one week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6783)|
| 1:53:08| I really don't care who calls me from last Monday to this Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6788)|
| 1:53:12| They can't change my mind because one week does not a trend make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6792)|
| 1:53:16| We can have a conversation about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6796)|
| 1:53:18| But what happened between last week and this week, to me, is not germane to this conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6798)|
| 1:53:25| We can have a great conversation about a trend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6805)|
| 1:53:27| And if we're trending downward, then I'm with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6807)|
| 1:53:30| Let's talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6810)|
| 1:53:32| Let's pull back based on a spread.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6812)|
| 1:53:38| This is frustrating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6818)|
| 1:53:41| So, will someone give me an opportunity to talk about the budget, either then or now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6821)|
| 1:53:52| Thank you, Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6832)|
| 1:53:53| Mr. Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6833)|
| 1:53:55| Chris, you wanted to rebuttal something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6835)|
| 1:53:58| Then I'll speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6838)|
| 1:54:01| We're using a trend analysis spreadsheet that shows, after one month, what we're trending toward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6841)|
| 1:54:10| It is just one month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6850)|
| 1:54:12| But that trend shows us being down at years in by $3.3 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6852)|
| 1:54:19| Schools concur with our projection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6859)|
| 1:54:22| There's no argument between them and us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6862)|
| 1:54:25| We're trending down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6865)|
| 1:54:26| Hotel-motel tax this week for the month of July, we're down $40,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6866)|
| 1:54:35| There's a correlation between hotel-motel tax and sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6875)|
| 1:54:40| If hotel-motel tax is down, sales tax is going to be down as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6880)|
| 1:54:45| There's a correlation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6885)|
| 1:54:47| I mean, we can get in this debate who told who to stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6887)|
| 1:54:51| We're talking about commitments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6891)|
| 1:54:54| Now, we're talking about commitments, carrying money over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6894)|
| 1:54:57| And it's accounting principle will say, do not spend recurring dollars on one-time revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6897)|
| 1:55:08| We got stopped by our auditors today, and they're like, you know, you're not supposed to spend recurring dollars on one-time revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6908)|
| 1:55:15| I said, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6915)|
| 1:55:16| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6916)|
| 1:55:17| And so, it's a battle we're facing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6917)|
| 1:55:21| But if you're going to use one-time dollars, and this is sales tax was up because of a hail storm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6921)|
| 1:55:29| That's the bottom line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6929)|
| 1:55:30| That's the only reason sales tax is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6930)|
| 1:55:32| That's what you're telling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6932)|
| 1:55:33| I'm telling you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6933)|
| 1:55:34| Well, we don't get an exact answer from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6934)|
| 1:55:37| We think hail storm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6937)|
| 1:55:38| We also think we're getting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6938)|
| 1:55:39| Well, we know we were getting a correction of $126,000 every month from the state on an error that they made in payment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6939)|
| 1:55:49| That's part of the reason that we were trending up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6949)|
| 1:55:52| But you can look and put into a trend analysis spreadsheet one month worth of sales tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6952)|
| 1:55:59| and get to where you think you're going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6959)|
| 1:56:01| Now, if next month trends upward, then this is going to change a little.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6961)|
| 1:56:06| But nobody's hiding anything, and nobody was telling you to stop because of a certain reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6966)|
| 1:56:14| That's just not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6974)|
| 1:56:16| I mean, we, and I've said it last week and I'll say it again, if three things hadn't occurred,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6976)|
| 1:56:23| we would not have a surplus in the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6983)|
| 1:56:27| And I've said it three or four times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6987)|
| 1:56:30| Health insurance, sheriff's fuel, and the haul income tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6990)|
| 1:56:36| If those three things don't happen, you all cannot sit here and designate money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=6996)|
| 1:56:41| because there wouldn't be any to designate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7001)|
| 1:56:44| Because if those three things flip, there is no surplus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7004)|
| 1:56:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7013)|
| 1:56:55| Mr. Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7015)|
| 1:56:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7016)|
| 1:56:58| Hugh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7018)|
| 1:57:00| Mr. Holt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7020)|
| 1:57:02| I appreciate your comments earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7022)|
| 1:57:05| And I hate bureaucracy getting in the way of progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7025)|
| 1:57:09| How long would it take your group to put that together if this were in a bid package?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7029)|
| 1:57:15| Typically something like this is four to six weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7035)|
| 1:57:18| And that's going through the process expeditiously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7038)|
| 1:57:22| and then getting it on your agenda for consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7042)|
| 1:57:27| Probably no more than eight weeks at the max.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7047)|
| 1:57:32| We have a minimum of 21 business days to advertise bids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7052)|
| 1:57:37| So right there is 30 days, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7057)|
| 1:57:41| Just looking at the numbers we talked about a week ago were about $18 a trip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7061)|
| 1:57:47| And I used that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7067)|
| 1:57:48| I got that, came to that conclusion on a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7068)|
| 1:57:52| since Barbara said they were using 250 days a year, money through Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7072)|
| 1:57:58| And dividing that into, you know, extrapolating it, 44 trips and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7078)|
| 1:58:04| Under the best scenario, I'm saying if this were passed today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7084)|
| 1:58:08| probably can't be implemented before November because we're almost October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7088)|
| 1:58:13| That's eight months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7093)|
| 1:58:14| That's only 184 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7094)|
| 1:58:18| And I'm just thinking it's, I don't know how that, if $500,000 is divided by that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7098)|
| 1:58:26| Seven to $18 a trip, it's not that bad, I don't guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7106)|
| 1:58:31| Particularly if it's from, you know, Concord to Corrington, that's a great deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7111)|
| 1:58:35| But I could see other trips that would not be that good of a deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7115)|
| 1:58:38| I'm just, I don't know if I would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7118)|
| 1:58:42| I think I'm skipping some of my financial responsibilities to the Knox County taxpayer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7122)|
| 1:58:48| if we don't give your scenario a shot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7128)|
| 1:58:52| and particularly in light of what the law director recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7132)|
| 1:58:55| I'm just, I'm sort of, I support this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7135)|
| 1:58:59| But I think we maybe should look at it a little closer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7139)|
| 1:59:03| Mr. Chairman, can I respond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7143)|
| 1:59:06| Can I respond to that, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7146)|
| 1:59:07| Ms. Royals, really, you're supposed to, you already had a significant amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7147)|
| 1:59:13| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7153)|
| 1:59:15| But I have specific answers for Ed's specific questions that I'd like to give to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7155)|
| 1:59:20| And you want to give it to him right now too, don't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7160)|
| 1:59:26| Go ahead, Ms. Royals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7166)|
| 1:59:27| Amy, do you have any information for me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7167)|
| 1:59:29| Yes, I do, Ed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7169)|
| 1:59:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7170)|
| 1:59:32| We can implement this immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7172)|
| 1:59:35| There's not going to be any delay in getting this started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7175)|
| 1:59:38| I've talked with CAC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7178)|
| 1:59:39| They can get this going by next week if we approve it today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7179)|
| 1:59:43| They can start offering these trips next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7183)|
| 1:59:47| So there won't be any delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7187)|
| 1:59:49| The amount per round trip is significantly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7189)|
| 1:59:53| it's about $7, maybe $8 less than what CAT does for these kinds of trips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7193)|
| 2:00:01| I don't think they're CAC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7201)|
| 2:00:05| This is what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7205)|
| 2:00:07| They know how to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7207)|
| 2:00:09| They've got the equipment to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7209)|
| 2:00:11| And they have the knowledge of how to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7211)|
| 2:00:14| I don't see where we're going to gain anything putting this out for bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7214)|
| 2:00:17| I honestly don't know who else would bid on this because this is what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7217)|
| 2:00:22| This is what they've been doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7222)|
| 2:00:24| This is what they're experts at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7224)|
| 2:00:26| And I imagine if we do delay it a couple of months by putting it out to bid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7226)|
| 2:00:29| it's going to come right back to CAC anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7229)|
| 2:00:32| This is something that we can do that has an immediate effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7232)|
| 2:00:36| It will be in place operational next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7236)|
| 2:00:41| And, again, this is not a recurring expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7241)|
| 2:00:45| It is a one-time expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7245)|
| 2:00:48| The funding mechanism is changing for transportation next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7248)|
| 2:00:53| And this particular item will probably, I'm not going to say promise that it won't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7253)|
| 2:01:00| but 90 percent sure it's not going to come up like this again because of the way the funding mechanism has changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7260)|
| 2:01:06| This is not a recurring expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7266)|
| 2:01:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7269)|
| 2:01:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7270)|
| 2:01:11| Mr. Armstrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7271)|
| 2:01:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7272)|
| 2:01:14| Whichever way we want to go, I think we have policies in place that Knox County should have an invitation for bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7274)|
| 2:01:23| But even as it's written by county commission on your motions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7283)|
| 2:01:26| we're going to have to prepare a defined services contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7286)|
| 2:01:30| which is going to take some time to put in legal form and get it implemented, get it executed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7290)|
| 2:01:36| So I just wanted you to understand that that's a process that we'll have to do before it can actually start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7296)|
| 2:01:42| And we really have some legal issues here to open this thing up without going through our normal process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7302)|
| 2:01:50| Since we've always had an invitation for bid for transportation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7310)|
| 2:01:55| they might advise probably to have an invitation for bid for transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7315)|
| 2:01:59| Let's prepare it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7319)|
| 2:02:00| It's not going to cost us that much more time, and it'll hit when people need it most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7320)|
| 2:02:06| That's just my recommendation to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7326)|
| 2:02:09| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7329)|
| 2:02:11| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7331)|
| 2:02:14| Some things that we've discussed here really don't add to the position that I think I'm trying to hold,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7334)|
| 2:02:22| and that being about the budget cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7342)|
| 2:02:25| But some of the discussions that's been raised on when did we declare a surplus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7345)|
| 2:02:33| or when did we have money left over and do we have money really left over now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7353)|
| 2:02:39| or should we stop this or should we continue with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7359)|
| 2:02:45| It's all hypothetical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7365)|
| 2:02:47| It's just building on which position of the case you might happen to be on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7367)|
| 2:02:52| And I think I'll hold to the fact that I want to say this is not about a recipe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7372)|
| 2:02:58| This is about a budget cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7378)|
| 2:03:00| And our best guess, and we made that, and we're still three months into the budget cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7380)|
| 2:03:06| And, actually, it's not that long until the budget cycle starts again, three more months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7386)|
| 2:03:11| and the administration will be thinking about what do they do in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7391)|
| 2:03:16| But specifically about things that are in this year's budget, 2% pay increase for school employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7396)|
| 2:03:23| If you remember the country boy question and the country boy answer, it's 2% from the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7403)|
| 2:03:29| and we expect them to send it again next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7409)|
| 2:03:32| So that is reoccurring and it's not our dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7412)|
| 2:03:35| The rainy day fund, we can say whether or not we have a good rainy day fund or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7415)|
| 2:03:41| but we need to compare it to Chattanooga, maybe a smaller city than we are with a lot less debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7421)|
| 2:03:47| And their rainy day fund is twice ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7427)|
| 2:03:51| And then why is Knox County all of a sudden not in very good shape?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7431)|
| 2:03:58| I think that over the last six months there have been lots of TV reports about Knox County leading the way in sales tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7438)|
| 2:04:07| revenue and development in the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7447)|
| 2:04:10| Knox County has been in the lead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7450)|
| 2:04:12| Well, maybe there was a reason behind that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7452)|
| 2:04:15| All the bricklayers working at the University of Tennessee or the hailstorm damage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7455)|
| 2:04:21| or there's really another one in there that we've not mentioned, but I can't think of it right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7461)|
| 2:04:25| that have sort of – oh, I know what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7465)|
| 2:04:30| It's hailstorm damage, but it was in two areas, roofs and vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7470)|
| 2:04:37| And then you can't get a bricklayer because they're all working at UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7477)|
| 2:04:43| The last thing that really would be my last word in all of what's taking place is I guess I did see the lady on TV| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7483)|
| 2:04:54| saying she appreciated the transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7494)|
| 2:04:59| But I got some phone calls that she was headed to the library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7499)|
| 2:05:04| I'm not saying that's good or bad, but I don't know if Knox County needs to be paying for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7504)|
| 2:05:15| Thank you, Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7515)|
| 2:05:16| Mr. Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7516)|
| 2:05:18| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7518)|
| 2:05:19| I have a couple of questions, again, for the barbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7519)|
| 2:05:23| Thank you all for being here, by the way, and being willing to answer questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7523)|
| 2:05:29| You're already providing this service, are you not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7529)|
| 2:05:31| I mean, what we're asking for is, is this a brand-new service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7531)|
| 2:05:35| or is this something you're already doing and you're just wanting to add to it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7535)|
| 2:05:38| It's a continuation of services that we're providing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7538)|
| 2:05:42| It would be focused on a type of service that we're not providing as much as we really need to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7542)|
| 2:05:52| which are the people who need to go for multiple trips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7552)|
| 2:05:57| When somebody, say, is recovering from a stroke| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7557)|
| 2:06:00| or they're recovering from a heart attack and they need to go to therapy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7560)|
| 2:06:04| and they call us and they say we would like to arrange transportation for stroke therapy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7564)|
| 2:06:13| for three days a week for the next six weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7573)|
| 2:06:16| in those instances we're having to say no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7576)|
| 2:06:20| that we can't schedule one person for that many trips| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7580)|
| 2:06:25| because we have only 21 trips a day that are really discretionary trips,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7585)|
| 2:06:32| and those would really fill up very, very quickly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7592)|
| 2:06:36| if we were to do that kind of therapy scheduling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7596)|
| 2:06:41| So the answer to your question is yes and no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7601)|
| 2:06:45| Yes, we do provide transportation for people to go, primarily medical transportation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7605)|
| 2:06:50| but this would be a type of transportation which we're currently denying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7610)|
| 2:06:55| that we would like to be able to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7615)|
| 2:06:59| Where I'm going with this is our law director said we've always had an invitation to bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7619)|
| 2:07:04| I believe that was the correct verbiage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7624)|
| 2:07:07| Now, have we had an invitation to bid for your transportation services up to this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7627)|
| 2:07:13| The funding that CAC has for transportation comes from a variety of sources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7633)|
| 2:07:18| The largest source of that funding is federal funds through TennCare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7638)|
| 2:07:25| We have funds that we receive through the Office on Aging,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7645)|
| 2:07:29| through the Community Services Block Grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7649)|
| 2:07:32| We have other folks who contract with us for services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7652)|
| 2:07:35| In addition to that, the CAC sets aside a portion of the funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7655)|
| 2:07:41| that are allocated to us by you each year for transportation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7661)|
| 2:07:47| and that is our safety net for transportation that we're using right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7667)|
| 2:07:53| It's about $230,000 out of the CAC allocation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7673)|
| 2:07:58| which is designated for transportation for people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7678)|
| 2:08:03| who have no other option for transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7683)|
| 2:08:08| If they can ride on CAT, they must go on CAT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7688)|
| 2:08:11| If they're eligible for TennCare, TennCare must be billed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7691)|
| 2:08:15| If they're eligible for any other type of service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7695)|
| 2:08:18| then we would not use the CAC Knox County funds to provide their transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7698)|
| 2:08:27| I guess my question is, is this up for an invitation for bid?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7707)|
| 2:08:30| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7710)|
| 2:08:31| That's what I was thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7711)|
| 2:08:32| I can't recall putting this up for bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7712)|
| 2:08:35| So to me, we're looking at a continuation of service for what you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7715)|
| 2:08:42| I mean, you're already doing this anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7722)|
| 2:08:44| We're saying we're going to provide you with additional funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7724)|
| 2:08:47| to go ahead with the service that you're providing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7727)|
| 2:08:54| Question for Hugh Holt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7734)|
| 2:08:57| We approved today school funding, $13.7 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7737)|
| 2:09:02| for Pond Gap, Shannondale, and Farragut High and other technology upgrades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7742)|
| 2:09:07| Now, for example, with Pond Gap Elementary, with the $7 million there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7747)|
| 2:09:11| we've appropriated the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7751)|
| 2:09:13| But now, will the school come back and do an RFP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7753)|
| 2:09:15| and go through the process to try to find somebody to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7755)|
| 2:09:19| Yes, they will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7759)|
| 2:09:20| In most cases, they already have some term bids that are in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7760)|
| 2:09:25| that they may utilize to do that, but most definitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7765)|
| 2:09:28| So, basically, we have it all on the head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7768)|
| 2:09:30| We've appropriated the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7770)|
| 2:09:31| We've said the money is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7771)|
| 2:09:32| Now, let's go out and basically figure it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7772)|
| 2:09:36| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7776)|
| 2:09:37| And I'd like to address the bidding of the transportation services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7777)|
| 2:09:41| And we have never bid senior trips,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7781)|
| 2:09:46| but that was included as a line item award from the commission years past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7786)|
| 2:09:52| But we do bid transportation services for the schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7792)|
| 2:09:57| and other agencies within the county, just not that particular one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7797)|
| 2:10:02| So, why do we want to start now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7802)|
| 2:10:08| Well, we moved away from this grant process into a defined services process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7808)|
| 2:10:15| where you, of course, as you recall, we did that this past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7815)|
| 2:10:20| And we just moved all those contracts into this particular bundle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7820)|
| 2:10:25| But it's to your discretion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7825)|
| 2:10:34| The bottom line is I'm in favor of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7834)|
| 2:10:36| and the reason I'm in favor of this is all of my career,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7836)|
| 2:10:39| and every year that goes by I add on to my career,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7839)|
| 2:10:43| is I've always been told that the most important thing is the bottom line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7843)|
| 2:10:49| and that the bottom line is figures and that you have to meet that bottom line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7849)|
| 2:10:53| And I agree with that because I've just been in meetings just this morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7853)|
| 2:10:57| as a matter of fact, talking about these very things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7857)|
| 2:11:00| But I think that there's another aspect to this as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7860)|
| 2:11:02| and that is we've talked a lot about figures, but I also want to talk about people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7862)|
| 2:11:09| And what has prompted me to bring this up is I spent yesterday afternoon at 407 Alt Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7869)|
| 2:11:17| talking with an elderly lady who is 83 years young,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7877)|
| 2:11:21| whose home has been on the front page of the paper today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7881)|
| 2:11:27| And so just in talking with her about the fact that she's lived there since the 70s| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7887)|
| 2:11:31| and her career and what she has done and she's not ready for her life to end yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7891)|
| 2:11:36| et cetera, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7896)|
| 2:11:38| it just made me realize that as I'm getting older| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7898)|
| 2:11:41| and as we have an aging senior citizen population out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7901)|
| 2:11:47| do we need to try to help these people get to the doctor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7907)|
| 2:11:50| Do we need to try to help these people get to therapy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7910)|
| 2:11:54| Do we need to try to help them if they have no other way of getting there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7914)|
| 2:11:58| This is why I'm sold on this is that it's my understanding that this is not going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7918)|
| 2:12:03| just for anybody and everybody to just go hopping on and joyriding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7923)|
| 2:12:08| This is going to be meeting a need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7928)|
| 2:12:11| And so I believe that one of the things that we do need to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7931)|
| 2:12:17| is to look at meeting the needs of people in our community that need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7937)|
| 2:12:22| And so that's why I asked if we can get a quarterly report on who has been helped with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7942)|
| 2:12:28| the types of people being done with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7948)|
| 2:12:30| so that we know and that we can look at it and we can go to our constituents and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7950)|
| 2:12:34| this is how the money has been spent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7954)|
| 2:12:36| these are the people that we have helped,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7956)|
| 2:12:38| and this is what you have done with your tax money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7958)|
| 2:12:41| I was also reminded by this 83-year-old lady at 407 Alt Avenue yesterday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7961)|
| 2:12:45| that she has paid taxes all her life in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7965)|
| 2:12:50| And so she continues to pay taxes every time she goes to the grocery store| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7970)|
| 2:12:54| or every time she buys a dress or every time she buys anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7974)|
| 2:12:57| She pays sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7977)|
| 2:12:59| So these senior citizens, in my view, have paid taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7979)|
| 2:13:05| We are here and doing what we can do now because of what they've done over these last several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7985)|
| 2:13:10| My vote will be to help support these people because I see it as providing a need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7990)|
| 2:13:17| And so I'm willing to vote in favor of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=7997)|
| 2:13:20| I understand where we're going on the need for a bid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8000)|
| 2:13:24| and I don't want to do anything that's illegal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8004)|
| 2:13:27| However, I'm not convinced that we just can't add money on to an existing program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8007)|
| 2:13:32| and that's why I was asking the barbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8012)|
| 2:13:34| And so I could go on and on and on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8014)|
| 2:13:38| but just so that the folks out there knowing where I'm coming from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8018)|
| 2:13:42| why I'm going to vote the way I am,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8022)|
| 2:13:44| I feel like that, yes, we need to look at figures, we need to talk about bottom lines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8024)|
| 2:13:48| but I also think that we need to talk about people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8028)|
| 2:13:51| And my vote will be to try to help these elderly people get to where they need to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8031)|
| 2:13:57| just so that they can function in life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8037)|
| 2:14:00| It is very difficult for elderly people to get to the doctor, to get to therapy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8040)|
| 2:14:05| because they rely on family members, they rely on friends,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8045)|
| 2:14:08| and if they have none of those, basically they're in isolation and they just sit there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8048)|
| 2:14:13| I'm not willing to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8053)|
| 2:14:15| And so, again, I just want the folks watching to know why I'm voting the way I'm voting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8055)|
| 2:14:20| and I'm going to go ahead and vote in favor of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8060)|
| 2:14:23| If we need to do a substitute motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8063)|
| 2:14:25| then I would vote in favor of a substitute motion to go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8065)|
| 2:14:28| and provide $500,000 for senior transportation if we have to put it up for bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8068)|
| 2:14:33| But that way we know the money is there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8073)|
| 2:14:35| and we know exactly what the bid process would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8075)|
| 2:14:40| Is that a substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8080)|
| 2:14:44| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8084)|
| 2:14:45| Not at this point, I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8085)|
| 2:14:49| Mr. McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8089)|
| 2:14:51| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8091)|
| 2:14:53| Mr. Royles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8093)|
| 2:14:55| Board of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8095)|
| 2:15:00| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8100)|
| 2:15:01| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8101)|
| 2:15:02| Go ahead, Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8102)|
| 2:15:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8104)|
| 2:15:08| Two things that we've been discussing here, looking at this two different ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8108)|
| 2:15:17| First off, let me start off by saying for the third month in a row,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8117)|
| 2:15:20| I can say that I agree with Mr. McKenzie on one item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8120)|
| 2:15:24| and that is the fact that when we were doing budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8124)|
| 2:15:28| we were told that some of these things that we questioned at the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8128)|
| 2:15:34| maybe not this particular item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8134)|
| 2:15:36| but things that we did question could be considered when we looked at the final numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8136)|
| 2:15:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8142)|
| 2:15:43| That's said, done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8143)|
| 2:15:44| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8144)|
| 2:15:47| This particular issue is no different than a defined service contract benefit with Dogwood Arts Festival,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8147)|
| 2:16:02| the BSU Arts Festival, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8162)|
| 2:16:04| All of these things we line out every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8164)|
| 2:16:06| We don't put them out on RFPs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8166)|
| 2:16:10| No, we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8170)|
| 2:16:13| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8173)|
| 2:16:16| All these grants that we give, some of them are given on, maybe I'm losing my train of thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8176)|
| 2:16:31| They're not put out for bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8191)|
| 2:16:32| They're put on defined benefit contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8192)|
| 2:16:36| And I don't think there's anything in there that says a defined benefit contract has to be put out for bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8196)|
| 2:16:42| Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8202)|
| 2:16:46| Currently, what we have done in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8206)|
| 2:16:48| we would do this kind of stuff that you talked about through grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8208)|
| 2:16:52| Recently, we went to the defined benefit contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8212)|
| 2:16:55| And when we have a contract, we have to put the contract out for bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8215)|
| 2:16:59| You can have an invitation for bid or a request for proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8219)|
| 2:17:04| If they're a sole source type entity and they're the only game in town, then you don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8224)|
| 2:17:11| That's the point I'm getting at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8231)|
| 2:17:12| We've got people like the free medical clinic, people that provide one-of-a-kind services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8232)|
| 2:17:17| that we're going to hound, hound, hound, and hound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8237)|
| 2:17:19| We're hounding people to death over these type of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8239)|
| 2:17:21| They're providing a service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8241)|
| 2:17:23| And if we keep beating this around the bush, we'll be on it now for an hour close to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8243)|
| 2:17:31| Well, you asked me the legal position on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8251)|
| 2:17:34| And what we normally do on these grant type things, we put it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8254)|
| 2:17:40| They apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8260)|
| 2:17:42| They go through the process at a given point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8262)|
| 2:17:45| And then you will award these, quote, bids and recommendations from a panel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8265)|
| 2:17:49| That block being said and done, now we're outside that opportunity for requests for our grants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8269)|
| 2:17:57| and requests for our proposals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8277)|
| 2:17:59| And you're asking for an additional program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8279)|
| 2:18:04| And I'm just saying that it would be in our best interest to invite somebody to bid on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8284)|
| 2:18:12| It's a half a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8292)|
| 2:18:14| Well, you know, when we start changing the rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8294)|
| 2:18:17| and then we apply some rules to one group and some rules to another group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8297)|
| 2:18:21| that dog don't hunt in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8301)|
| 2:18:24| I don't know about anyplace else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8304)|
| 2:18:26| But if we're going to get on the program, let's get on the program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8306)|
| 2:18:30| and all do dig in the same ditch with the same shovel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8310)|
| 2:18:34| That's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8314)|
| 2:18:37| Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8317)|
| 2:18:39| What the law director said is spot on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8319)|
| 2:18:42| We do an RFP and then a committee will evaluate and recommend funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8322)|
| 2:18:47| And I think what he's trying to get at is if you do this process now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8327)|
| 2:18:51| then you're avoiding the RFP process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8331)|
| 2:18:54| And that's part of the reason we said we should do an RFP process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8334)|
| 2:19:00| Back to my comment a moment ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8340)|
| 2:19:05| It's the only game in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8345)|
| 2:19:06| Mr. Brown, you don't have your light on, but you want to go ahead with Mr. Caldwell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8346)|
| 2:19:12| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8352)|
| 2:19:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8353)|
| 2:19:15| Ms. Rawls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8355)|
| 2:19:16| Actually, we all remember the days that we had the committees that did the community grants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8356)|
| 2:19:23| and then we switched it to it's not an invitation for bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8363)|
| 2:19:28| It's not an RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8368)|
| 2:19:30| This year it was an RFI, a request for information, that nonprofits provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8370)|
| 2:19:37| And there was a committee that looked at them and recommended some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8377)|
| 2:19:41| And there were some changes made, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8381)|
| 2:19:45| I'm not entirely sure before it came before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8385)|
| 2:19:50| We've just heard that this is not a new service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8390)|
| 2:19:55| This is an expansion of a current service that CAC already provides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8395)|
| 2:20:01| CAC, so if you're going to include them as a nonprofit, it wouldn't be bid out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8401)|
| 2:20:07| and it wouldn't be an RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8407)|
| 2:20:09| It would be a request for information, as other nonprofits did, for new programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8409)|
| 2:20:16| This isn't new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8416)|
| 2:20:18| I'd also like to say, you know, we just approved $98,000 for FluMist for the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8418)|
| 2:20:25| Should we have bid that out to see if there was someone who could do it cheaper than our own health department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8425)|
| 2:20:30| Because that's exactly what we're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8430)|
| 2:20:34| If we think we should make CAC bid on this transportation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8434)|
| 2:20:38| then we should make the health department bid on if they're the cheapest game in town to go out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8438)|
| 2:20:42| and provide FluMist to all the students because that's what we just approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8442)|
| 2:20:46| I can also say that, you know, when looking at the votes from last week's work session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8446)|
| 2:20:52| the next thing coming up is the money for the senior center in District 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8452)|
| 2:21:01| And it got the same number of votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8461)|
| 2:21:03| That is going to be, you know, I've heard all this, oh, we can't do recurring expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8463)|
| 2:21:07| That's exactly what that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8467)|
| 2:21:09| It's going to be $300,000 for location and site development and design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8469)|
| 2:21:14| and then another almost million to build it and then close to $100,000 every year to staff and run it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8474)|
| 2:21:21| That's a recurring expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8481)|
| 2:21:23| But that got the mayor's blessing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8483)|
| 2:21:25| This did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8485)|
| 2:21:27| And it's making me absolutely sick to my stomach that our communities, senior citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8487)|
| 2:21:35| are being turned into a political issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8495)|
| 2:21:39| Now, either you support our senior citizens or you turn them into a political issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8499)|
| 2:21:45| because that's what I see going on right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8505)|
| 2:21:48| As Mike said, we've been at this for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8508)|
| 2:21:51| And all I see at the root of all of this is political score points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8511)|
| 2:21:59| And I am not at all happy about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8519)|
| 2:22:06| So I see a lot of discrepancies in people's positions on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8526)|
| 2:22:10| And I think we need to support this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8530)|
| 2:22:15| We know it's going to be beneficial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8535)|
| 2:22:17| And even if the money is, even if we have to write something out, if they know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8537)|
| 2:22:24| if CAC knows that the money is coming, they can start immediately offering this transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8544)|
| 2:22:29| They're not going to have to wait for the law department to do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8549)|
| 2:22:36| If they know the money is coming, they can start immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8556)|
| 2:22:40| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8560)|
| 2:22:42| Thank you, Ms. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8562)|
| 2:22:43| Talking about political, you know, guys and ladies, I'm term limited, so it doesn't matter to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8563)|
| 2:22:48| Commissioner Wright, I appreciate your comments that you made there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8568)|
| 2:22:53| Ed, one of the things that I'm looking at, and this is where I'm uncomfortable with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8573)|
| 2:22:57| is that, yes, Mike, I am with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8577)|
| 2:22:59| I'm for seniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8579)|
| 2:23:00| I just don't think this is a good bargain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8580)|
| 2:23:02| Five hundred thousand for what the law directors just told us is that by the time we get it implemented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8582)|
| 2:23:07| you know, we're going to have probably seven months to use that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8587)|
| 2:23:13| So getting seven months at that $500,000, that's going to shoot that price way up there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8593)|
| 2:23:17| probably close to $30 per trip or maybe a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8597)|
| 2:23:21| So, you know, Dave Wright will tell you, I'm tight with money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8601)|
| 2:23:26| And I just don't think that it's a good bargain for what we're getting out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8606)|
| 2:23:33| Mr. Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8613)|
| 2:23:35| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8615)|
| 2:23:36| This will be my last comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8616)|
| 2:23:37| We've belabored this quite a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8617)|
| 2:23:39| I don't know where the mayor is at on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120924?start=8619)|
