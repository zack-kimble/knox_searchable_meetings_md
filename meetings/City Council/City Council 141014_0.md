| 0:00:25| Let us pray. Holy God, thank you that we are free to express our faith in public spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141014?start=25)|
| 0:00:32| We pray tonight in asking you to infuse your wisdom into our city leaders as we ponder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141014?start=32)|
| 0:00:37| future developments and new strategies and objectives. We pray for peace in our streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141014?start=37)|
| 0:00:43| and in our neighborhoods. We ask for you to provide food and shelter tonight for those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141014?start=43)|
| 0:00:48| who are in need, jobs for those who are unemployed, and guidance for those who are oppressed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141014?start=48)|
| 0:00:52| and protection for those who are in danger. We pray for our uniformed officers and ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141014?start=52)|
| 0:00:57| for you to protect them day and night, granting them the courage to do their job and the protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141014?start=57)|
| 0:01:02| from its demands. And we ask for your wisdom to be given to us without measure for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141014?start=62)|
| 0:01:08| items before us and that we act in a way that honors you. Amen. Congratulations to the flag| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141014?start=68)|
| 0:01:18| of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141014?start=78)|

| 0:02:24| for participation in the visit last week by the Urban Land Institute. I know many of you were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141014?start=144)|
| 0:02:29| there on Friday at the panel's presentation and you know there are a lot of certainly interesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141014?start=149)|
| 0:02:35| ideas, a lot of things they've sort of challenged us with that we will now be looking at. We're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141014?start=155)|
| 0:02:40| digesting it and we will get their report I guess within 30 to 60 or 90 days. We think probably 30| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141014?start=160)|
| 0:02:49| to 60 days we will get their actual final report. In the meantime, the slide show that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141014?start=169)|
| 0:02:54| presented is up on the city website. If you go to cityofknoxville.org, Urban Land Institute, is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141014?start=174)|
| 0:03:03| right? Where's Jesse? Is that right? Okay. cityofknoxville.org slash Urban Land Institute and you will see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141014?start=183)|
| 0:03:12| there a slide show. Also, you will see an email address there that you can click on. It's ULI at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141014?start=192)|
| 0:03:19| cityofknoxville.org and we encourage you if you want to make any comments about the presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141014?start=199)|
| 0:03:25| about the recommendations, please do so there and we will read all of those. And so we're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141014?start=205)|
| 0:03:31| gather all of this information and consider it while we await the final report and then we'll start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141014?start=211)|
| 0:03:36| setting our priorities and decide what we, you know, how we feel about each of those implementations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141014?start=216)|
| 0:03:42| and what the next steps are. Of course, we'll be talking to council about that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141014?start=222)|
| 0:03:47| Next Tuesday, I want to invite you all out to Chilhowee Park. We have a double ribbon cutting, a couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141014?start=227)|
| 0:03:53| new projects that we want to celebrate. This is Tuesday, October 21st at 11 a.m. The first is our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141014?start=233)|
| 0:04:00| brand new public restrooms, which have, there's been a need out there, as you all know, for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141014?start=240)|
| 0:04:07| This will make the park more user friendly and more family friendly, especially with the new Kaboom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141014?start=247)|
| 0:04:13| playground that the Moose is planning to build nearby. The second is a new solar array on the roof of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141014?start=253)|
| 0:04:20| Jacob Building. This has been actually installed by a third party, Aries Energy, at no cost to the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141014?start=260)|
| 0:04:27| and you can find out more about those at the event on next Tuesday at 11 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141014?start=267)|
| 0:04:33| Finally, I want to remind everybody that early voting for the November 4th election starts tomorrow morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141014?start=273)|
| 0:04:39| Wednesday, October 15th. And as you all know, we have five city charter amendments on the ballot, all of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141014?start=279)|
| 0:04:46| dealing with our pension system. We have complete explanations of all five amendments in plain English.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141014?start=286)|
| 0:04:53| There's the legalese that you have to put on the ballot, but we have the plain English explanation and why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141014?start=293)|
| 0:05:00| council and the mayor are supporting those amendments. And to find that, you go to the cityofknoxville.org| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141014?start=300)|
| 0:05:09| forward slash pension. And then also there's a link on the homepage to get to it. If you have any questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141014?start=309)|
| 0:05:17| about the amendments, please take a look at those. And council, as you get questions during early voting and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141014?start=317)|
| 0:05:23| election time, please share that link with your constituents. It's, people really need to understand that before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141014?start=323)|
| 0:05:31| they go in because you're not going to understand it if you just read the legalese. It's kind of difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141014?start=331)|
| 0:05:36| We encourage everybody to support these amendments. This is, you know, two years ago we had major pension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141014?start=336)|
| 0:05:43| reform and voters supported 76, I think it was 76 percent of the vote, supported the pension changes. We asked for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141014?start=343)|
| 0:05:51| support again. This is continued ways to improve the pension system, to continue to provide good benefits to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141014?start=351)|
| 0:05:58| employees, but not to increase costs to taxpayers, but to try and find ways to offer benefits but not have long-term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141014?start=358)|
| 0:06:07| risk to the taxpayers. So we encourage you to support that as council has. So that's the end of my report. Any reports from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141014?start=367)|
| 0:06:17| council? Councilman Stair? Thank you, Mayor. I just wanted to announce the Public Property Naming Committee is meeting a week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141014?start=377)|
| 0:06:23| from tonight. So if you or any of your constituents want to have a piece of public property named or renamed, please get their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141014?start=383)|
| 0:06:31| applications in. Thank you. Councilman Dela Valle. Yeah, I apologize, I left my computer at home, but I wanted folks to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141014?start=391)|
| 0:06:39| mindful that on October the 27th, I believe, they will be having sort of a public hearing in this building, I'm not sure if it's this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141014?start=399)|
| 0:06:47| room or the other, concerning health care in the center city and that, and they're gathering information to evaluate as part of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141014?start=407)|
| 0:06:55| Tenova Certificate of Need. So if you have something to present, you are welcome to come down and present that information to the body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141014?start=415)|
| 0:07:03| that will be here in Knoxville gathering that information. Okay, thank you. Councilman Wallace. Yes, thank you, Mayor. Well, next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141014?start=423)|
| 0:07:11| Tuesday night is the annual, I think, elected officials bike ride from the bike zoo. You have Carolina Cooley's here tonight, and I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141014?start=431)|
| 0:07:19| she's come to speak about other things, but I'll invite her to the microphone to tell us a little bit about that. Mr. Campin, you're going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141014?start=439)|
| 0:07:28| Yes, I'll be there. Mr. Pavlis. I'll be there. Mr. Ponders. I'm going. And the Mayor. I would be there, except the public property naming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141014?start=448)|
| 0:07:36| committee. Way to go. We'll name a street after us. Dr. Cooley, thank you for being here. It's the third annual bicycle ride with elected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141014?start=456)|
| 0:07:46| officials from bike zoo, and this year we're going to enlarge it and have hopefully more participants and have a little fun afterwards at a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141014?start=466)|
| 0:07:53| reception at the bike zoo with some food and drink and live music, and I hope that all of you can attend, and we're going to go right on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141014?start=473)|
| 0:08:06| greenway this year and just see what beautiful greenways we have and also maybe a few problem spots, and that's all. Well, we've got good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141014?start=486)|
| 0:08:15| participation from up here. That's at 6 o'clock at the bike zoo in their new location. New location. It's in Homburg. It's on Homburg. On Whittaker Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141014?start=495)|
| 0:08:27| Kind of just west of where Chick-fil-A is. Also, I would like to pick up on your remarks about you, Mayor, and say that I was there Friday for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141014?start=507)|
| 0:08:37| presentation. I found it fascinating, and I found it really stretching in the ideas, and I know you will, and I just encourage all of us to really think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141014?start=517)|
| 0:08:48| about these things, what they presented, and give it great thought and great participation from the community. Getting Henley Street right is really a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141014?start=528)|
| 0:08:58| priority, and I really appreciate them bringing that out, and I think we have some great opportunities there to look at. They threw out some ideas that will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141014?start=538)|
| 0:09:06| stretch us all, and I appreciate that. I think their purpose for that was well done, and it was very well received. That's why we brought them here. That's right. You did well, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141014?start=546)|
| 0:09:16| that was a good call on that. Thank you. Okay. Anything else from Council? We'll move on. Thank you. 8A is a resolution confirming the appointment of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141014?start=556)|
| 0:09:27| Rosamar and Ann Barker to the Police Advisory and Review Committee. Move for approval. Second. We have a motion and a second. All in favor, say aye. Aye. Any opposed? The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141014?start=567)|
| 0:09:39| 8B is a resolution approving the appointment of Mayor Belcola to the Metropolitan Knoxville Airport Authority. Move for approval. Second. We have a motion and a second. All in favor, say aye. Aye. Any opposed? The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141014?start=579)|
| 0:09:52| 9A is an ordinance repealing Chapter 16, Article 11, Section 16-418 of the Knoxville City Code, which requires filing financial statements for a solicitation permit within 90 days of the close of the fiscal year. So moved. Second. We have a motion and a second. All in favor, say aye. Aye. Any opposed? The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141014?start=592)|

| 0:10:29| 11A is a resolution authorizing the Mayor to approve the sale of one decommissioned SUV and one full-size sedan to the Bradley County, Tennessee Sheriff's Office for the total price of $5,000. So moved. Second. We have a motion and a second. All in favor, say aye. Aye. Any opposed? The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141014?start=629)|
| 0:10:46| 11B is a resolution authorizing the Mayor to enter into an agreement with Tennessee Clean Water Network for the City to receive water bottle filling stations at various parks and recreation facilities for a total cost not to exceed $4,521 in City funds and to recognize Tennessee Clean Water Network and PetSafe for their donations toward the purchase of these stations. So moved. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141014?start=646)|
| 0:11:09| Patience Melnick is here from Tennessee Clean Water Network. I want to invite her to come down and explain this to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141014?start=669)|
| 0:11:16| Hi. Thanks for having me this evening. I just wanted to say on behalf of the Tennessee Clean Water Network, thank you so much for considering this contract. And I also wanted to acknowledge our partners in this project. There have been a lot of people who have helped get us to this point tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141014?start=676)|
| 0:11:35| And they have recognized the importance of free and convenient access to water in our public places. As you probably know, our state suffers from very high rates of obesity and diabetes. We are fourth in the nation in rates of obesity and fifth in diabetes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141014?start=695)|
| 0:11:52| And increasingly, studies are showing that sugary beverages are a huge part of this problem. So, for example, drinking just one 12-ounce sugary drink a day increases our risk of diabetes by 22%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141014?start=712)|
| 0:12:07| So the Clean Water Network, with a grant from the State Department of Health, has launched this program called Bringing Tap Back. And essentially what we're trying to do is to encourage Tennesseans to drink water instead of sugary beverages. And also instead of disposable water, which is very detrimental to our environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141014?start=727)|
| 0:12:29| So I just wanted to say a quick thank you to members of the City of Knoxville staff. David Brace, Joe Walsh, Karen Briggs, and many others have met with us, given us their time generously to talk about this project. They're always a pleasure to work with. We appreciate them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141014?start=749)|
| 0:12:45| I also wanted to say a big thank you to PetSafe. They're represented here tonight by John Brinda. He serves on the Philanthropy Committee. And they have very generously offered to donate the dog bowl portion for five of these outdoor units so our pets can enjoy them as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141014?start=765)|
| 0:13:05| Finally, our third-party partners are the Vestal Boys and Girls Club, Iams Nature Center, Knox Area Transit, the Public Building Administration have all given us support and promised to do installations and maintenance for those units that would go on their properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141014?start=785)|
| 0:13:22| So this project is enabling us to do work like this that we're doing in Knoxville and five other cities across the state in six universities, including UT, and in seven Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141014?start=802)|
| 0:13:36| Lastly, I just wanted to announce that as part of this project, this spring we'll be unrolling an app so that when people are out in public, they can find these public units but also drinking fountains that exist already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141014?start=816)|
| 0:13:53| And we've also been partnering with Knoxville's Public Arts Committee to design a public art competition to wrap the units in art, similar to a vehicle wrap that will include health messaging and the like, just to raise awareness. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141014?start=833)|
| 0:14:10| Very good. Well, thank you so much. Thanks to Tennessee Clean Water Network, PetSafe, and all of the partners and sponsors on this. I think it's a great collaboration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141014?start=850)|
| 0:14:20| So, Council, we have a motion and a second. All in favor say aye. Aye. Any opposed? The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141014?start=860)|
| 0:14:26| 11C is a resolution authorizing the Mayor to execute an easement deed with East Tennessee Community Design Center, Inc. to permit access to a parcel of property adjacent to the new Lorain Street Public Works Complex. So moved. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141014?start=866)|
| 0:14:39| We have a motion and a second. All in favor say aye. Aye. Any opposed? The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141014?start=879)|
| 0:14:44| 11D is a resolution authorizing the Mayor to execute all documents necessary to apply for and, if awarded, accept a grant from the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation to provide 100% reimbursable funding for equipment related to used oil recycling within the City of Knoxville in an amount not to exceed $14,600. So moved. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141014?start=884)|
| 0:15:04| We have a motion and a second. All in favor say aye. Aye. Any opposed? The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141014?start=904)|
| 0:15:09| 11E is a resolution authorizing the Mayor to request the Public Building Authority of the County of Knox and the City of Knoxville, Tennessee to perform construction management services related to replacing the roof system at the Lakeshore Park Chapel Building in an amount not to exceed $32,000. So moved. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141014?start=909)|
| 0:15:26| We have a motion and a second. All in favor say aye. Aye. Any opposed? The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141014?start=926)|
| 0:15:31| 11F is a resolution authorizing the Mayor to request the Public Building Authority of the County of Knox and the City of Knoxville, Tennessee to perform construction management services related to replacing the roof structure of the golf cart shed at Whittlesprings Golf Course in an amount not to exceed $25,000. So moved. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141014?start=931)|
| 0:15:48| We have a motion and a second. All in favor say aye. Aye. Any opposed? The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141014?start=948)|
| 0:15:54| 12A is an ordinance to amend Chapter 23, Article 1 of the Knoxville City Code to add a new section requiring the adoption of a complete streets policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141014?start=954)|
| 0:16:05| Moved. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141014?start=965)|
| 0:16:08| Councilman Dellavapi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141014?start=968)|
| 0:16:09| Yeah, I wonder if our council, Mr. Swanson, would consider adding either to the resolution or the document itself some simple phrasing to the effect that no intention to create nor is one created a private right of action under this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141014?start=969)|
| 0:16:28| This is a policy to stimulate the government to do its job, but we don't want someone who's disgruntled to be suing us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141014?start=988)|
| 0:16:36| You might want to think about no private right of enforcement or action is created by this policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141014?start=996)|

| 0:16:49| I appreciate the suggestion. I really think that it's probably implicit in the fact that it's just an administrative policy and it's nothing beyond that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141014?start=1009)|
| 0:17:01| If you would like to amend the ordinance, you can feel free to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141014?start=1021)|

| 0:20:05| user-friendly streets for all users.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141014?start=1205)|
