| 0:17:36| owned by the city of Knoxville and the stoplights you'll see through the trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1056)|
| 0:17:41| The final page you'll see is Knox Chapman Corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1061)|
| 0:17:45| In the far right-hand corner of this, you'll see the multifamily property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1065)|
| 0:17:50| along the backyards of Stonewall Properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1070)|
| 0:17:54| You'll see the office in front of this house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1074)|
| 0:17:57| You'll see the commercial properties, and but for the one residential property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1077)|
| 0:18:02| that sits in a pie shape between Busby and Stonewall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1082)|
| 0:18:06| this house is surrounded by multifamily, commercial, and office property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1086)|
| 0:18:11| except for the back of this house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1091)|
| 0:18:14| I do know that the residents who live in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1094)|
| 0:18:18| and I'm going to turn this down, it's noisy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1098)|
| 0:18:20| I do know that the residents who live in this neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1100)|
| 0:18:23| want their property values to be maintained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1103)|
| 0:18:25| They have sought us out and asked us not to sell this property at a low price| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1105)|
| 0:18:29| because we're going to hurt their market comps if we do so, devaluing their properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1109)|
| 0:18:34| The best solution is to convert this property from single-family residential to an office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1114)|
| 0:18:40| allowing an entrepreneur, a business person, to come and live in this house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1120)|
| 0:18:44| If you take a look at the last page of the house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1124)|
| 0:18:48| you will see that the bottom floor is suited for an office with a door going into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1128)|
| 0:18:54| This is in keeping with the City of Knoxville zoning planning of state of the art of live where you work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1134)|
| 0:19:01| It is compatible with the urban concept of multi-use property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1141)|
| 0:19:05| of being able to live where you work that is moving into the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1145)|
| 0:19:09| This is clearly an urban area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1149)|
| 0:19:11| By accomplishing this rezoning to the residential to office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1151)|
| 0:19:17| you allow this neighborhood to keep its values, maintain its residential characteristic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1157)|
| 0:19:23| and at the same time afford somebody affordable living while they're able to work there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1163)|
| 0:19:29| Comments were made on page 4 of the plan amendment that it was not compatible with this neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1169)|
| 0:19:35| I think this clearly shows that this property is compatible with this neighborhood to be rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1175)|
| 0:19:41| I believe I have clearly shown today, behind a shadow of a doubt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1181)|
| 0:19:45| that although nothing has happened in the last 20 years per the comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1185)|
| 0:19:50| this property was built in the 1940s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1190)|
| 0:19:53| In the past 80 years, this area has changed significantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1193)|
| 0:19:57| This property has not been for sale for decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1197)|
| 0:20:00| Nobody knew how much value was being impacted by the location of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1200)|
| 0:20:06| We acquired it as a favor to family friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1206)|
| 0:20:09| This is the first time in approximately 50 years it's been available for sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1209)|
| 0:20:14| We now know there are serious consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1214)|
| 0:20:19| So to protect the values, I ask that you go ahead and approve this from residential to office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1219)|
| 0:20:26| And in the last comment regarding increased traffic, that's a red herring, smoke and mirrors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1226)|
| 0:20:32| there is very little traffic going into the CPA office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1232)|
| 0:20:35| In a small office such as this, the additional traffic will be no more than if you have a teenager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1235)|
| 0:20:40| And if you have a teenager, probably more traffic with a teenager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1240)|
| 0:20:44| than an office in a house like this. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1244)|
| 0:20:47| Thank you, Ms. Harwell. Do we have any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1247)|
| 0:20:53| Seeing no opposition, I'll turn it over to the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1253)|
| 0:20:59| Chairman Hill, I'd like to make a motion, please,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1259)|
| 0:21:01| to deny the one-year plan amendment to office per staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1261)|
| 0:21:06| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1266)|
| 0:21:09| We've got a motion to deny per staff recommendation by Commissioner Phillips,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1269)|
| 0:21:14| seconded by Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1274)|
| 0:21:17| I see Commissioner Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1277)|
| 0:21:20| Excuse me, Chairman. I made a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1280)|
| 0:21:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1283)|
| 0:21:24| I need to change my motion. I need to deny the sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1284)|
| 0:21:28| Excuse me. Per staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1288)|
| 0:21:30| Deny the sector plan. This is our first motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1290)|
| 0:21:32| Deny the sector plan per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1292)|
| 0:21:35| We've got a motion from Commissioner Phillips, seconded by Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1295)|
| 0:21:42| Is that correct? Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1302)|
| 0:21:45| All right. You good with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1305)|
| 0:21:46| All right. So now let's take it to the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1306)|
| 0:21:49| Commissioner Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1309)|
| 0:21:51| Thank you, Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1311)|
| 0:21:53| I just want to respond to Ms. Harwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1313)|
| 0:21:56| So are you aware that in residential you are still allowed to have a home office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1316)|
| 0:22:03| Yes, I am aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1323)|
| 0:22:05| So even with the existing zone, that that person, whoever buys your piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1325)|
| 0:22:10| would still be able to have an office in that zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1330)|
| 0:22:12| I do understand this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1332)|
| 0:22:14| But this also allows somebody, if they want to be a beautician, that they can have a parlor down there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1334)|
| 0:22:19| that if they have the benefit of having an office zoning to hold the value of this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1339)|
| 0:22:35| whereas it still does not negatively impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1355)|
| 0:22:38| And even though this has been explained to buyers, obviously it's not having an impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1358)|
| 0:22:44| Well, and I guess I'm planning on approving or voting for staff's recommendation to deny your property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1364)|
| 0:22:50| but I think our job is not to assess property values in making our decisions for zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1370)|
| 0:22:58| but basically to look at what the characteristics are for that piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1378)|
| 0:23:02| and whether the zone that you're being proposed is appropriate for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1382)|
| 0:23:06| And I do agree with staff that for this piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1386)|
| 0:23:09| that maintaining the residential zoning is the best use of that piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1389)|
| 0:23:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1393)|
| 0:23:14| Thank you, Commissioner Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1394)|
| 0:23:16| Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1396)|
| 0:23:18| Actually, a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1398)|
| 0:23:22| So I just heard Commissioner Midas say that it's okay to have an office in a residential neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1402)|
| 0:23:33| Would that be a use on review, though, if they did that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1413)|
| 0:23:37| It would be a use on review, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1417)|
| 0:23:39| You'd have to ask staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1419)|
| 0:23:42| For a home occupation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1422)|
| 0:23:46| I have to just turn to my experts, folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1426)|
| 0:23:52| I'm sorry, was that a yes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1432)|
| 0:23:54| I think Ms. Hillman is checking it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1434)|
| 0:24:03| They're all searching the codes, aren't they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1443)|
| 0:24:10| While they're searching, I also do see a zoning examiner in the rear who may be able to speak on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1450)|
| 0:24:18| I'm just going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1458)|
| 0:24:22| 10.3.R, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1462)|
| 0:24:30| City codes represent us out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1470)|
| 0:24:37| What were you going to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1477)|
| 0:24:38| I'm just thinking about what we have all been through for the past two years that most of us have been working from our homes, or many of us have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1478)|
| 0:24:53| If I may, the home occupation section talks about the gross floor area devoted to the home occupation cannot exceed 25% of the gross floor area of the dwelling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1493)|
| 0:25:03| Other than that, there's some language in here about no outdoor storage, that the exterior of the home can't be modified to make it look like a business, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1503)|
| 0:25:14| As long as they were able to meet their criteria within 10.3.R, within that accessory structures and uses of the city's code, then the home occupation would be allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1514)|
| 0:25:23| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1523)|
| 0:25:24| It's limited by not having it as an office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1524)|
| 0:25:27| Hang on one second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1527)|
| 0:25:28| So it's allowed by right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1528)|
| 0:25:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1530)|
| 0:25:31| So there is a vehicle without rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1531)|
| 0:25:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1537)|
| 0:25:38| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1538)|
| 0:25:41| I concur with Commissioner Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1541)|
| 0:25:45| I'm very sensitive to the historic nature of this property and that area, and think that staff has this correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1545)|
| 0:25:56| And it is important to protect those historic legacy neighborhoods as much as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1556)|
| 0:26:02| So for that reason, I would like to make a motion to deny the one-year plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1562)|
| 0:26:08| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1568)|
| 0:26:10| We've already had a motion on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1570)|
| 0:26:13| May I go ahead and excuse me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1573)|
| 0:26:15| There's already a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1575)|
| 0:26:16| Oh, well, then I would second that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1576)|
| 0:26:18| You did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1578)|
| 0:26:19| You did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1579)|
| 0:26:20| Are we at the point then that I can make the motion to deny the zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1580)|
| 0:26:25| Not yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1585)|
| 0:26:26| There's a motion and a second on the table that needs to be voted on first, and then it will be time to make a second motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1586)|
| 0:26:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1591)|
| 0:26:32| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1592)|
| 0:26:33| There's a sector plan, then a one-year plan, and then the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1593)|
| 0:26:35| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1595)|
| 0:26:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1597)|
| 0:26:40| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1600)|
| 0:26:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1602)|
| 0:26:43| So our first motion, get back up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1603)|
| 0:26:47| We've got three of them to deal with, is deny the sector plan per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1607)|
| 0:26:54| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1614)|
| 0:26:56| Seeing no other lights, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1616)|
| 0:26:59| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1619)|

| 0:28:09| Approximate size of track, six acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1689)|
| 0:28:12| Present plan and zoning designation is office, stream protection, office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1692)|
| 0:28:17| Proposed plan designation, community commercial and stream protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1697)|
| 0:28:21| Existing land use, agriculture, forestry, vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1701)|
| 0:28:25| Staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1705)|
| 0:28:28| First motion on the sector plan is to approve the sector plan amendment to community commercial and stream protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1708)|
| 0:28:35| for a portion of parcel 11903313 because it is consistent with the location criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1715)|
| 0:28:45| The second motion is approve the one-year plan amendment to community commercial and stream protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1725)|
| 0:28:52| for a portion of the same parcel because it is consistent with the location criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1732)|
| 0:28:58| And the third and final motion is approve CH2 highway commercial zoning for a portion of the A4C parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1738)|
| 0:29:08| as noted in Exhibit A because it is an extension of the existing commercial zoned area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1748)|
| 0:29:13| and retains a buffer zone adjacent to the existing residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1753)|
| 0:29:18| Is the applicant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1758)|
| 0:29:20| I'm here for the applicant, Ben Mullins, 550 West Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1760)|
| 0:29:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1763)|
| 0:29:24| Mr. Mullins, do we have any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1764)|
| 0:29:29| Please proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1769)|
| 0:29:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1771)|
| 0:29:33| Our application is completely in lockstep with staff's recommendation with the exception of the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1773)|
| 0:29:41| You can see in the map there we asked for a little portion of the northeast corner there to be zoned CH2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1781)|
| 0:29:49| Staff recommendation is to redraw that line making it basically straight across to retain a buffer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1789)|
| 0:29:56| all the way across the northern edge of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1796)|
| 0:29:59| We're fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1799)|
| 0:30:01| We don't have any objections to that at all, and we would ask that you support staff's recommendation for all three motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1801)|
| 0:30:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1807)|

| 0:30:12| Commission, any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1812)|
| 0:30:16| I'd like to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1816)|

| 0:30:50| I'd like to make a motion that we approve the one-year plan amendment to CC community commercial and SP stream protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1850)|

| 0:31:13| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1873)|
| 0:31:14| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1874)|
| 0:31:15| I'd like to make a motion to approve CH2 highway commercial zoning for a portion of the parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1875)|
| 0:31:20| 119 is noted in the Exhibit A because of the extension of the existing commercial zone area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1880)|
| 0:31:25| and retains a buffer for the residential neighboring properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1885)|

| 0:31:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1906)|
| 0:31:51| Next on the agenda is item 16, applicant Joel Cannon, the third.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1911)|
| 0:31:58| Location, east of Childress Road and west of Pettigo Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1918)|
| 0:32:02| Size of track, .7 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1922)|
| 0:32:04| Present zoning is agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1924)|
| 0:32:07| Zone requested, low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1927)|
| 0:32:09| Existing land use, rural residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1929)|
| 0:32:13| My recommendation is to deny the low-density residential because it is not consistent with the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1933)|
| 0:32:23| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1943)|
| 0:32:25| Yes, I am present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1945)|
| 0:32:26| Joel Cannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1946)|
| 0:32:27| I'm at 8226 Pettigo Road, right up the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1947)|
| 0:32:31| Thank you, Mr. Cannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1951)|
| 0:32:32| Do we have any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1952)|
| 0:32:36| Seeing no opposition, please proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1956)|
| 0:32:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1960)|
| 0:32:41| Thank you, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1961)|
| 0:32:42| So this is something I've been working on for maybe half a year, and I'm kind of learning as I go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1962)|
| 0:32:49| And that little piece of land is a part of what's right across Pettigo there, and it's all ag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1969)|
| 0:32:57| But that little piece of land is only seven-tenths of an acre, so we wanted to build a house on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1977)|
| 0:33:03| and found that we could not because it needed to be an acre, to my understanding, if it was agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1983)|
| 0:33:10| So we said, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1990)|
| 0:33:11| I went down to planning, got to meet them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1991)|
| 0:33:13| Ms. Whitney really helped me understand, put the application in, and then it came back to be denied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=1993)|
| 0:33:20| which introduced me to the growth plan, which I was unfamiliar with but started looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2000)|
| 0:33:27| And what I would like to stress today is that little piece of land right there is not really functional as farmland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2007)|
| 0:33:37| because it's across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2017)|
| 0:33:40| It's too small to really do anything with, and it's not practical for me to get to to farm it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2020)|
| 0:33:47| but it's also not practical as cutting off something else across the street to get up to that acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2027)|
| 0:33:55| So it's almost deemed unusable unless we can rezone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2035)|
| 0:33:59| I would just want to put one house on it, single-family home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2039)|
| 0:34:05| And I even, I don't know if it's worth looking at it or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2045)|
| 0:34:07| I brought a plan that I think kind of matches that Copeland neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2047)|
| 0:34:11| which was not in the growth plan but seemed to meet the needs of being rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2051)|
| 0:34:15| Copeland Heights right there to the south and some of the existing houses there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2055)|
| 0:34:23| And I had a surveyor quickly draw it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2063)|
| 0:34:25| It would fit nicely right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2065)|
| 0:34:27| Access would work, water and sewers there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2067)|
| 0:34:30| So I think that's all the time I need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2070)|
| 0:34:33| I just want to petition that we reconsider that based on it being almost unusable as it sits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2073)|
| 0:34:39| And though it does not fit the growth as it's stated in the growth plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2079)|
| 0:34:44| I think it fits based on what's going up around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2084)|
| 0:34:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2088)|
| 0:34:49| Thank you for your comments, Mr. Cannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2089)|
| 0:34:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2092)|
| 0:34:53| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2093)|
| 0:34:55| Well, I'm going to take the opportunity to say that the growth plan still is out of date, vastly out of date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2095)|
| 0:35:01| So as I looked at this and I get some of the rationale behind the staff's recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2101)|
| 0:35:07| but then I use some common sense and it just doesn't make sense to deny this one little seven-tenths of an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2107)|
| 0:35:13| when literally across the street they can do the same thing that he's wanting to do with just one house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2113)|
| 0:35:19| He's not asking for the entire thing to be rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2119)|
| 0:35:21| But on either side of this property is residential, low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2121)|
| 0:35:29| So I would make a motion, but I'll let discussion go on for a minute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2129)|
| 0:35:33| but I would make a motion later on to approve this because I do believe it fits with what's already in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2133)|
| 0:35:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2142)|
| 0:35:43| Mr. Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2143)|
| 0:35:45| I would tend to agree with Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2145)|
| 0:35:48| I mean, you've got planned residential across the street and there's still some RA up the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2148)|
| 0:35:56| I mean, would this have been a better zone or request in planned residential versus RA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2156)|
| 0:36:02| Does it matter with the growth plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2162)|
| 0:36:05| Not the growth plan, right, but the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2165)|
| 0:36:07| Does it fit with planned residential better, which allows you to build a house as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2167)|
| 0:36:13| That's a staff question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2173)|
| 0:36:14| I'm not sure who.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2174)|
| 0:36:15| Ms. Warner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2175)|
| 0:36:20| Yeah, I think planned residential is probably better suited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2180)|
| 0:36:25| The rural area does allow planned residential consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2185)|
| 0:36:31| Okay, just clarifying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2191)|
| 0:36:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2192)|
| 0:36:36| Mr. Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2196)|
| 0:36:37| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2197)|
| 0:36:38| A question for Ms. Warner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2198)|
| 0:36:40| Is this a lot of record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2200)|
| 0:36:44| A lot of record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2204)|
| 0:36:45| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2205)|
| 0:36:47| Do you know when it was subdivided off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2207)|
| 0:36:51| I do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2211)|
| 0:36:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2212)|
| 0:36:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2213)|
| 0:36:54| Yeah, whether it is or not, I guess at this point it's irrelevant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2214)|
| 0:36:58| But, yeah, I kind of tend to agree with Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2218)|
| 0:37:03| I'll probably vote to rezone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2223)|
| 0:37:06| Commissioner Schell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2226)|
| 0:37:09| I think Commissioner Phillips' question probably coincides with mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2229)|
| 0:37:14| Like, how is it a separate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2234)|
| 0:37:18| The parcel is very odd how it's separated, and that's because of how it was deeded off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2238)|
| 0:37:23| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2243)|
| 0:37:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2246)|
| 0:37:31| So it can't be sold separately from the other parcel currently because it's not a lot of record then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2251)|
| 0:37:39| Yeah, it can't be platted separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2259)|
| 0:37:42| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2262)|
| 0:37:43| It's too small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2263)|
| 0:37:44| It's not an acre in size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2264)|
| 0:37:58| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2278)|
| 0:38:00| Just to make sure that because it's connected to that larger shape, the rezoning wouldn't be impacting that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2280)|
| 0:38:09| It would only be impacting the small triangle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2289)|
| 0:38:12| It was only the small triangle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2292)|
| 0:38:14| And part of the learning curve that might answer the last two questions was I couldn't even really have a surveyor come cut that out because it was connected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2294)|
| 0:38:23| and then it would be too small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2303)|
| 0:38:27| Yeah, I just want to do that part of the small pie-shaped piece or ice cream cone, not the other piece of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2307)|
| 0:38:38| Is that clearly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2318)|
| 0:38:39| I know we're all understanding this, but in terms of the platting or deeding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2319)|
| 0:38:45| is that clear so that the zoning would only impact the ice cream cone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2325)|
| 0:38:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2330)|
| 0:38:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2331)|
| 0:38:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2335)|
| 0:38:56| Chair will entertain a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2336)|
| 0:38:57| So with that, I'll make a motion to approve whatever it is I need to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2337)|
| 0:39:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2344)|
| 0:39:05| Getting there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2345)|
| 0:39:06| The R.A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2346)|
| 0:39:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2347)|
| 0:39:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2348)|
| 0:39:09| To approve the R.A. zone for this ice cream cone-shaped piece of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2349)|
| 0:39:16| I'll second Commissioner Smith's motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2356)|
| 0:39:19| We have a motion by Commissioner Smith to approve R.A. low-density residential seconded by Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2359)|
| 0:39:28| We have one light here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2368)|
| 0:39:29| We're going to hear from Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2369)|
| 0:39:32| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2372)|
| 0:39:35| Under the R.A., would he be allowed to have more than one house on that lot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2375)|
| 0:39:44| We'll defer to staff on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2384)|
| 0:39:45| If we rezone it to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2385)|
| 0:39:47| And can we restrict it to one dwelling unit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2387)|
| 0:39:52| Well, the minimum lot size is 10,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2392)|
| 0:39:57| So technically, yeah, you could have more than one lot on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2397)|
| 0:40:01| It might be challenging with the setbacks because of how the lot is shaped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2401)|
| 0:40:05| So there may not be much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2405)|
| 0:40:06| So basically, the restriction is going to be one house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2406)|
| 0:40:09| Yeah, probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2409)|
| 0:40:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2410)|
| 0:40:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2411)|
| 0:40:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2415)|
| 0:40:16| Seeing no other lights, we do have a motion to approve R.A. low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2416)|
| 0:40:22| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2422)|
| 0:40:23| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2423)|
| 0:40:24| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2424)|
| 0:40:25| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2425)|
| 0:40:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2427)|
| 0:40:44| Got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2444)|
| 0:40:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2451)|
| 0:40:52| We're moving on to agenda number 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2452)|
| 0:40:56| Lost my screen for just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2456)|
| 0:40:58| So I appreciate your patience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2458)|
| 0:41:05| Applicant Keith Stewart, location west side of Dry Gap Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2465)|
| 0:41:08| south of East Beaver Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2468)|
| 0:41:10| Approximate size of track is 4.76 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2470)|
| 0:41:14| Present zoning is C.A. general business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2474)|
| 0:41:19| Zoning requested, C.B. business and manufacturing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2479)|
| 0:41:22| and existing land use, agricultural forestry, vacant land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2482)|
| 0:41:27| Staff recommendation is to approve the C.B. business and manufacturing zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2487)|
| 0:41:32| because it is an extension of existing commercial node subject to one condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2492)|
| 0:41:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2500)|
| 0:41:41| I see the applicant is before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2501)|
| 0:41:44| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2504)|
| 0:41:45| My name is Keith Stewart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2505)|
| 0:41:46| I live at 800 Blows Ferry, Knoxville, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2506)|
| 0:41:52| We are in complete agreement with the staff's recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2512)|
| 0:41:57| I think it's actually a smart idea to have that vegetation toward the residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2517)|
| 0:42:02| and I'm happy to answer any questions, but we're fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2522)|
| 0:42:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2527)|
| 0:42:08| Do we have any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2528)|
| 0:42:11| We do have opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2531)|
| 0:42:12| Mr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2532)|
| 0:42:17| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2537)|
| 0:42:18| Kevin Murphy, 4508 Murphy Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2538)|
| 0:42:20| I'm here on behalf of the Knox County Planning Alliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2540)|
| 0:42:22| We submitted a comment on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2542)|
| 0:42:24| So this is requested zoning here is C.B. zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2544)|
| 0:42:28| That's the more heavier commercial zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2548)|
| 0:42:32| and one of the things I want to call you for is that that really allows a pretty expansive use of the very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2552)|
| 0:42:38| or a lot of pretty intense uses, and to the west and the south, you have residential land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2558)|
| 0:42:45| Now, in the definition of the C.B. zone, which is 532.01,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2565)|
| 0:42:49| it even says that that zone has an adverse impact on surrounding property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2569)|
| 0:42:54| So this zone provides for a wide range of business and manufacturing use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2574)|
| 0:42:59| The nature of such businesses is to attract large volumes of automobile and truck traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2579)|
| 0:43:03| and to have adverse effects on surrounding properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2583)|
| 0:43:06| Hence, they are not properly associated with nor compatible with residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2586)|
| 0:43:10| or institutional uses or other uses that require an environment free of noise, odors, and congestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2590)|
| 0:43:16| So that's what the C.B. zone is for, and that's the kind of uses that are allowed here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2596)|
| 0:43:21| C.B., there's a lot of uses that are permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2601)|
| 0:43:24| There are some that are on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2604)|
| 0:43:26| I looked in the planning cases file.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2606)|
| 0:43:29| I don't see off the top of my head where that C.B. zone that's north of it came from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2609)|
| 0:43:35| That looks like that might be earlier than what is in the KGIS system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2615)|
| 0:43:38| so it's probably been around for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2618)|
| 0:43:40| So just as an advisory, extending the C.B. zone based off of what's to the north of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2620)|
| 0:43:45| you're looking at a zoning that was set on that property decades ago probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2625)|
| 0:43:50| and is just one of those legacy remnants from early zoning in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2630)|
| 0:43:56| There are options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2636)|
| 0:43:57| You might consider maybe neighborhood commercial, which has less intense uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2637)|
| 0:44:00| and also has lighting standards and landscaping screens and signage standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2640)|
| 0:44:05| that are designed to be a little bit more compatible with adjacent residential uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2645)|
| 0:44:09| So we'd urge you to consider the impact on adjacent residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2649)|
| 0:44:14| and consider possibly neighborhood commercial instead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2654)|
| 0:44:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2657)|
| 0:44:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2658)|
| 0:44:22| Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2662)|
| 0:44:24| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2664)|
| 0:44:27| I am intrigued with Mr. Murphy's suggestion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2667)|
| 0:44:31| and would like to ask staff if there's some compelling reason why that wouldn't have been pursued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2671)|
| 0:44:39| Ms. Albertson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2679)|
| 0:44:43| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2683)|
| 0:44:45| One of the limitations with the neighborhood commercial zone is that it says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2685)|
| 0:44:50| that no individual building or commercial establishment shall have a floor area exceeding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2690)|
| 0:44:55| Liz, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2695)|
| 0:44:56| Liz, can you speak closer to the mic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2696)|
| 0:44:58| No individual building or commercial establishment in the neighborhood commercial zone district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2698)|
| 0:45:02| shall exceed 5,000 square feet in size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2702)|
| 0:45:05| So it is a little bit of a more limited zone district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2705)|
| 0:45:11| and staff felt that requiring a vegetated buffer would help protect the adjacent residential properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2711)|
| 0:45:25| But just thinking out loud, the vegetative buffer protects those properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2725)|
| 0:45:32| but if it's changed to CB, anything that's allowed in the CB can happen there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2732)|
| 0:45:40| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2740)|
| 0:45:46| Commissioner Schell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2746)|
| 0:45:52| I wish the county's code had a matrix because it's a lot easier to look at the different uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2752)|
| 0:45:58| that are allowed between CB and CA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2758)|
| 0:46:01| So it's currently CA, which has a wide range of commercial uses currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2761)|
| 0:46:07| I also kind of agree that it just doesn't seem to quite fit to allow some more intense manufacturing uses in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2767)|
| 0:46:16| Ms. Albertson, do you happen to know off the top of your head some of those more intense uses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2776)|
| 0:46:22| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2782)|
| 0:46:23| Well, demolition landfills are allowed in almost every zone district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2783)|
| 0:46:27| but particularly with the CB zone, the more intensive uses could be lumber yards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2787)|
| 0:46:39| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2799)|
| 0:46:42| Heavy truck, tractor, or heavy equipment sales, but not motor freight terminals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2802)|
| 0:46:50| Contractor storage yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2810)|
| 0:46:53| Vehicle repair and service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2813)|
| 0:46:55| I believe that's actually also allowed in the CA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2815)|
| 0:47:00| Wholesale warehousing and a distribution enterprise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2820)|
| 0:47:08| Those, I would say, are the primary heavier uses that could be permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2828)|
| 0:47:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2833)|
| 0:47:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2835)|
| 0:47:16| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2836)|
| 0:47:19| I just want to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2839)|
| 0:47:20| So, Liz, when you said that under the CA, which was neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2840)|
| 0:47:25| any building they want to put on this large track would be limited to 5,000 square feet or less?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2845)|
| 0:47:31| That's under the CN.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2851)|
| 0:47:32| The CN?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2852)|
| 0:47:33| Uh-huh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2853)|
| 0:47:34| What about under the CA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2854)|
| 0:47:36| There are no minimum building sizes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2856)|
| 0:47:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2858)|
| 0:47:43| Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2863)|
| 0:47:46| There's CB next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2866)|
| 0:47:50| I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2870)|
| 0:47:51| What's the use there right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2871)|
| 0:47:56| Do we know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2876)|
| 0:47:58| I can answer that if the commission will let me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2878)|
| 0:48:02| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2882)|
| 0:48:03| The building there at the top, the long, skinny building, that's a crossfit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2883)|
| 0:48:08| The lot to the left is a construction yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2888)|
| 0:48:13| It's park-heavy equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2893)|
| 0:48:15| And I believe that the same person who owns those two parcels owns the retail across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2895)|
| 0:48:22| Just it might help to say the reason that I'm here is because I had some interest in the property from a company that does some light manufacturing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2902)|
| 0:48:33| It wouldn't have a huge impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2913)|
| 0:48:35| And when we started looking at the zoning, it didn't fall under CA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2915)|
| 0:48:40| or I didn't feel like that it was appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2920)|
| 0:48:43| I can tell you nobody, based on where this property is, it's not going to be something that's going to be a burden on this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2923)|
| 0:48:52| The issues are the size of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2932)|
| 0:48:55| We need the bigger buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2935)|
| 0:48:58| But the property is kind of bifurcated by that blue stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2938)|
| 0:49:01| And so what we're looking at is potentially some retail up toward dry gap up toward the right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2941)|
| 0:49:08| There's area to build there, and then you can see the stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2948)|
| 0:49:11| And then what we wanted to do was put some manufacturing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2951)|
| 0:49:14| It's more warehousing than anything toward the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2954)|
| 0:49:18| So you understand, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2958)|
| 0:49:20| I did ask about the use because I was curious what that CV was being used for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2960)|
| 0:49:24| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2964)|
| 0:49:25| If we, as a commission, if we rezone, we have to make those decisions based on what could actually be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2965)|
| 0:49:32| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2972)|
| 0:49:34| Five years from now, if somebody decides to come in and put in a landfill, then they could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2974)|
| 0:49:38| So that's where we have to be on the decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2978)|
| 0:49:41| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2981)|
| 0:49:42| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2982)|
| 0:49:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2983)|
| 0:49:44| Commissioner Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2984)|
| 0:49:46| Nope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2986)|
| 0:49:47| Yeah, I'm good at answering my questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2987)|
| 0:49:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2988)|
| 0:49:49| Commissioner Schelso.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2989)|
| 0:49:51| Yeah, I just see that this area is developing a lot of residential around here, and I don't see that changing, that trend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=2991)|
| 0:50:00| And especially with the kind of advanced NOx presentation, potentially building out some town and country commercial nodes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3000)|
| 0:50:08| I think it would be better to keep this CA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3008)|
| 0:50:11| Therefore, I'll make the motion to deny the rezone from CA to CB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3011)|
| 0:50:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3022)|
| 0:50:23| We have a motion to deny CB zoning by Commissioner Schelso.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3023)|
| 0:50:29| Seconded by Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3029)|
| 0:50:31| And we still have some lights on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3031)|
| 0:50:33| So let's move to Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3033)|
| 0:50:37| Well, my question would be on a different motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3037)|
| 0:50:40| So let's take this up, and then we'll see how this goes and come back to my other question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3040)|
| 0:50:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3046)|
| 0:50:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3047)|
| 0:50:48| Seeing no other lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3048)|
| 0:50:50| And what we're voting on with this current motion is to deny CB, business and manufacturing zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3050)|
| 0:50:59| All in favor to deny, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3059)|
| 0:51:03| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3063)|
| 0:51:04| All in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3064)|
| 0:51:06| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3066)|
| 0:51:07| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3067)|
| 0:51:08| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3068)|
| 0:51:09| Let's call a roll, Miss Karen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3069)|
| 0:51:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3072)|
| 0:51:13| Commissioner Uten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3073)|
| 0:51:15| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3075)|
| 0:51:16| Commissioner Boyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3076)|
| 0:51:17| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3077)|
| 0:51:18| Commissioner Philips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3078)|
| 0:51:19| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3079)|
| 0:51:21| Mr. Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3081)|
| 0:51:22| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3082)|
| 0:51:23| Mr. Schelso.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3083)|
| 0:51:24| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3084)|
| 0:51:25| Commissioner Perez.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3085)|
| 0:51:27| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3087)|
| 0:51:28| Mr. Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3088)|
| 0:51:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3090)|
| 0:51:31| Mr. Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3091)|
| 0:51:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3093)|
| 0:51:34| Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3094)|
| 0:51:35| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3095)|
| 0:51:36| Commissioner Barber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3096)|
| 0:51:38| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3098)|
| 0:51:39| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3099)|
| 0:51:40| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3100)|
| 0:51:41| Commissioner Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3101)|
| 0:51:43| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3103)|
| 0:51:44| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3104)|
| 0:51:45| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3105)|
| 0:51:46| Motion fails. Is that correct, Ms. Caring? Motion fails 7-6. Chair will entertain another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3106)|
| 0:51:59| motion or more discussion. Well, before we do a motion, I have a question. I see there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3119)|
| 0:52:04| one condition, so is it possible, and pardon my ignorance here, where the staff is recommending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3124)|
| 0:52:11| the 20-foot depth that we could say that also, that 20-foot depth also has to remain CA and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3131)|
| 0:52:18| we do everything else CB? So that way there's a CA buffer with that 20-foot buffer as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3138)|
| 0:52:26| So there's no way that the CB could go right up next to the neighborhood. Well, we've split| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3146)|
| 0:52:31| the zone before, haven't we? Staff? Can we do that without the owner asking for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3151)|
| 0:52:43| I'm just asking if it's possible. I just want to know if it's possible before I turn and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3163)|
| 0:52:49| ask the question. I believe it is possible for you to make that recommendation. Okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3169)|
| 0:52:56| so considering that you stated early on that you believe that buffer between the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3176)|
| 0:53:02| would you be fine with that 20-foot buffer remaining CA if we do everything else CB?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3182)|
| 0:53:09| Well, given the fact that the buffer would be part of it, I don't think there's a reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3189)|
| 0:53:14| to do that, but no, I don't have any objection because as far as I'm concerned, that 20-foot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3194)|
| 0:53:19| vegetation buffer is unusable. That's a buffer. And I get that. I just want to make sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3199)|
| 0:53:25| in the future, someone can't decide to ignore that buffer and go right up next to the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3205)|
| 0:53:31| So that's why I'm trying to think how we can put some additional things in place once it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3211)|
| 0:53:35| no longer in your control. So let's kind of continue that conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3215)|
| 0:53:40| I'll let you finish. Nope, I'm done. Okay. I'd like to hear from staff on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3220)|
| 0:53:47| Would there be any difference? I'm assuming, does this condition run with the land, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3227)|
| 0:53:53| to speak? Yes, it does. Okay. So you're really, I don't see any real effect by split zoning it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3233)|
| 0:54:00| Speak. I can't hear you. Vice Chair? It would be the same thing we just did with Mr. Mullins| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3240)|
| 0:54:11| on Parkview or whatever that was down there on the office where we just left that buffer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3251)|
| 0:54:16| in the back. I don't think there would be any difference. Just leave the portion that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3256)|
| 0:54:21| zone CACA and the CB would just go to where the new line is. I don't see a distinction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3261)|
| 0:54:29| so I'm fine with that. I still don't understand the purpose. If we're going to have, if the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3269)|
| 0:54:37| buffer runs with the land, what's the benefit of keeping that buffer? Well, the other case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3277)|
| 0:54:45| was in the city, right? And we can't put conditions on zoning in the city. That's why we did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3285)|
| 0:54:51| And this one's in the county. Yeah, I hear what you're saying, Chairman, and I'm not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3291)|
| 0:54:55| disagreeing with what you're saying, that it's not going to make a material change in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3295)|
| 0:55:01| the use of the property. I think CB, you can do outdoor storage, and whether or not there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3301)|
| 0:55:07| some sort of setback issue, maybe with a building, that the building setback might be different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3307)|
| 0:55:14| in CB versus CA, I don't know. But I'd rather have a bigger buffer, personally, and just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3314)|
| 0:55:25| call it a day, but whatever you want to do. Staff have any comment on that? No. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3325)|
| 0:55:35| I guess, you know, if you wanted to have a bigger buffer, then that could be part of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3335)|
| 0:55:40| the recommendation, so. Oh, man. All right. Let's pick up the conversation here. Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3340)|
| 0:55:47| Higgins. I don't really have a lot of thoughts on the split zoning, one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3347)|
| 0:55:55| I guess an argument for that could be that the buffer doesn't show up, like, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3355)|
| 0:56:01| on KGIS. So, you know, if there was to be a, somebody was to go beyond that buffer in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3361)|
| 0:56:07| the future, then visually you would see, you know, someone could kind of check it easily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3367)|
| 0:56:13| I guess. So that could be a benefit of that. I don't have, again, a strong opinion either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3373)|
| 0:56:18| way. But I also would be in support of maybe making the buffer a little bigger, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3378)|
| 0:56:24| that seems like it could accomplish a lot of the thoughts and concerns here, so. Thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3384)|
| 0:56:30| you. Commissioner Phillips. Thank you, Chairman Hill. You know, another possibility, and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3390)|
| 0:56:36| committee may go crazy on this, is leave CA on the south side of the blue line, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3396)|
| 0:56:42| then CB on the north side of the blue line. That would actually defeat the whole purpose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3402)|
| 0:56:48| of the rezoning, because that's the larger area. That's where the CB is actually necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3408)|
| 0:56:54| It would be, it's up toward the road that we're going to, my intent is to develop this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3414)|
| 0:57:01| and make it very attractive and fit within the neighborhood, but use the property to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3421)|
| 0:57:06| its highest and best use. And the interest I've gotten is from light manufacturing, which,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3426)|
| 0:57:12| again, it's not going to have a significant impact on traffic, noise, or anything. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3432)|
| 0:57:21| Commissioner Smith. So since we're all in complete agreement on everything we're about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3441)|
| 0:57:27| to do, I'm going to go ahead and just state my original and put it in there, because,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3447)|
| 0:57:33| again, I'm looking at not the immediate one, two, three years down the road. I'm looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3453)|
| 0:57:38| 20 years down the road so that there's a clear indication of what our intent was. So I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3458)|
| 0:57:43| just going to say that we put the 20-foot buffer remains CA. Everything else we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3463)|
| 0:57:48| zone CB. Into the form of a motion. And just a landscaping question. I'm just going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3468)|
| 0:57:57| say, is the landscaping still required within that? Yes. The condition remains. The condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3477)|
| 0:58:01| remains. I think we need staff's comment on that. If that's still CA, would the buffer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3481)|
| 0:58:18| if it's CA, is the buffer still there? I think that you can make this condition apply to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3498)|
| 0:58:26| the entirety of the property. But you have to be cautious how you word, I think, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3506)|
| 0:58:38| recommendation. So maybe it would be along the lines of, you know, approve CB because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3518)|
| 0:58:44| it's an extension of the existing commercial node for a portion of the parcel. And then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3524)|
| 0:58:52| you would say, but subject to one condition and then provide a vegetative buffer adjacent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3532)|
| 0:59:05| to the, I guess you could say the south and west perimeters of the subject property and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3545)|
| 0:59:11| maybe leave out what the adjacent zone districts are. I know that's confusing. All that she| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3551)|
| 0:59:19| just said. Okay, so let's just make sure we're going to get this as we all understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3559)|
| 0:59:30| Are we increasing the buffer at all? Does that one condition buffer change or are you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3570)|
| 0:59:36| adding it to another side of the property? No, the buffer would remain on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3576)|
| 0:59:44| So we're going to, so approve the CB because of the extension of the commercial node subject| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3584)|
| 0:59:50| to one condition which would provide a vegetative buffer and rezone that buffer or keep the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3590)|
| 1:00:00| buffer as CA? Is that? Okay, sorry, let me think about this. I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3600)|
| 1:00:05| that if you say approve the CB zone for a portion of the property, retain the adjacent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3605)|
| 1:00:13| existing CA zoning for a 20 foot buffer between the PR and A zone parcels to the south and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3613)|
| 1:00:27| west and then, yeah, I think subject to one condition, provide the vegetative buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3627)|
| 1:00:35| If I may, the buffers contain wholly within the CA zone. Yeah, that's what. Yeah. That's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3635)|
| 1:00:50| how it was interpreted, yes. So it would be zoned at CB except for the 20 foot buffer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3650)|
| 1:00:58| area would be maintained at CA zoning or zone plus would be a landscape. Yes. I think it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3658)|
| 1:01:08| would be clear to say but to retain the CA zoning. Okay. And then. In the buffer zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3668)|
| 1:01:16| area. Yeah, and then subject to one condition. But you've also clarified it as to the portions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3676)|
| 1:01:24| that abut the A and PR. Correct. So ultimately on the zoning map what we would end up with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3684)|
| 1:01:35| is a CB zone with what we have a K which means condition and then a CA zone with a K which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3695)|
| 1:01:42| means condition. That's the main thing to make sure that both of those zone districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3702)|
| 1:01:48| have the condition attached to it. Ms. Karen, do you have that down? Okay. So when there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3708)|
| 1:01:57| a condition it shows on the map with a K next to it? Yeah. So then that would be how we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3717)|
| 1:02:02| are able to tell that there's a buffer requirement in the future when a permit's pulled which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3722)|
| 1:02:06| means we don't really need to have the two different zones. Is there a motion on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3726)|
| 1:02:13| floor right now? We just can't explain it. Because if not I'll make a motion. Okay. Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3733)|
| 1:02:26| Smith has made a motion. I want to go back and ask a question because Commissioner Schelso| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3746)|
| 1:02:33| brought up a good point. If we do the one condition is it going to show up as a K? Because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3753)|
| 1:02:41| I haven't, I'm sorry, I've just never seen the K on anything we've looked at before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3761)|
| 1:02:45| That's why I'm kind of now just, this is something new. Yes. Anytime there's a condition it'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3765)|
| 1:02:51| say the zone district and there will be a little K in parentheses adjacent to it. Anytime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3771)|
| 1:02:58| there's a condition. We're looking all over the county. It's not very common but it does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3778)|
| 1:03:05| happen from time to time. And it seems to happen more frequently these days. I happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3785)|
| 1:03:11| to know of one near the intersection of Valley Vista Road and Hardin Valley if you want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3791)|
| 1:03:15| type that in. It's a little bit south of that intersection. So it's similar to when there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3795)|
| 1:03:19| a parentheses C on some of the city old plan developments. Yes, exactly. Liz, what's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3799)|
| 1:03:26| height limitations on the CB? Okay. I'm sorry. I don't know if that's a good question. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3806)|
| 1:03:35| apologize. So height in the CB zone is contingent on the width of the road that the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3815)|
| 1:03:48| abuts. So no building may be built to a height exceeding twice the width of the road upon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3828)|
| 1:03:54| which the building abuts. Buildings may exceed this height limit providing the portion of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3834)|
| 1:04:00| the building higher than twice the width of the road is set back from every road and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3840)|
| 1:04:05| lot line one foot for each three feet of height in excess of twice the road width. I'm sorry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3845)|
| 1:04:15| you asked to. How does that compare with CA? CA, no building shall exceed 45 feet or three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3855)|
| 1:04:22| stories in height. So much easier to interpret. I believe both roads, or well, the dry gap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3862)|
| 1:04:35| right there I think would, CB would limit us to the CA height. I don't, and there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3875)|
| 1:04:40| no, at least I don't have any plans to make it any taller than that. Okay. So I'm going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3880)|
| 1:04:45| to clean this up. In light of the fact that we all just learned that there is a parentheses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3885)|
| 1:04:50| K on this map, I'm going to just make a motion that we approve staff recommendation as it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3890)|
| 1:04:56| is listed in this packet. Second. With the one condition? Yes. Okay. Alright, we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3896)|
| 1:05:07| a motion by Commissioner Smith to approve her staff recommendation, seconded by Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3907)|
| 1:05:15| Phillips. All in favor say aye. Aye. Any opposed? No. No. We have Commissioner Schelso, Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3915)|
| 1:05:26| Adams, Commissioner Perez. Is that it? Is that all the noes? Okay. So we've got three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3926)|
| 1:05:35| noes. Oh, you're not a no. So Commissioners Perez and Schelso vote no. So we've got two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3935)|
| 1:05:44| noes. Thank you. Thank you. Gosh, I had caught that too. Motion carries. Thank you. Thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3944)|
| 1:05:56| you. Alright. Alright, next item is number 20. Applicant, Bronzy Harris. Location, northeast| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3956)|
| 1:06:03| end of Clayberry Drive, north of Oak Ridge Highway. Approximate size of track, 4.96 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3963)|
| 1:06:17| Present zoning, agricultural. Zoning request is planned residential and the existing land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3977)|

| 1:06:29| the planned residential zone up to 8 dwelling units per acre because it is consistent with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3989)|
| 1:06:35| the sector plan and consistent with surrounding development. Is the applicant present? Present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=3995)|
| 1:06:44| Please state your name and address. Bronzy Harris. Is that personal address or business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4004)|
| 1:06:48| address? Any that you want. I'll say 109 Winona Street, Knoxville, Tennessee. Alright. Do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4008)|
| 1:06:55| we have any opposition? And we have opposition. Would you like to proceed or defer? I'll defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4015)|
| 1:07:05| Okay. Kevin Murphy, 4508 Murphy Road. I'm here representing the Knox County Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4025)|
| 1:07:13| Alliance. We wanted to call attention to a policy that's in the general plan that's in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4033)|
| 1:07:18| the development policy section. Policy 11.2 guides that medium density, 6 to 12 dwelling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4038)|
| 1:07:26| units an acre in planned growth in urban areas is appropriate along collector or arterial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4046)|
| 1:07:32| roads, waterfronts, and as buffer zones between lower density residential and more intense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4052)|
| 1:07:36| uses. This is in the planned growth area. Clayberry Drive is, however, not an arterial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4056)|
| 1:07:42| or collector road. So, if that's how they're getting access to it, then it wouldn't meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4062)|
| 1:07:48| that arterial or collector street requirement. And it would potentially be in conflict with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4068)|
| 1:07:54| the general plan of Knoxville, Knox County. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Murphy. And the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4074)|
| 1:08:01| applicant may proceed. So, we're aware of the access. We're aware of the access to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4081)|
| 1:08:12| property. Spoke with a couple of the neighbors on Clayberry Drive as well. Draw your attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4092)|
| 1:08:17| to the fact that we, Knox Housing Partnership, owns the properties that are to the south| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4097)|

| 1:08:43| You can see them now. And we've worked with the county. We're an affordable housing nonprofit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4123)|
| 1:08:50| And we've worked with the county to fund these senior communities. This is a way of background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4130)|
| 1:08:57| On those 20 units, as soon as we finished them, they were filled. There was a waiting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4137)|
| 1:09:02| list beforehand. And I fully expect the senior community that we're planning to build on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4142)|
| 1:09:09| Clayberry will be the same. Willow is actually high density. It's Willow Bend Way was actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4149)|
| 1:09:18| I think it was 18 units per acre. And Mary Sharp is 12 units per acre. We have actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4158)|
| 1:09:26| explored, to address your concern, to address the concern of Clayberry Drive, we have explored| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4166)|
| 1:09:32| everybody around that's landlocked us in there. Mr. Nix, who is on the MDR 71 lot there, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4172)|
| 1:09:43| sent him a letter saying if we could possibly purchase part of that land. We spoke to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4183)|
| 1:09:50| commercial property where the Karm store is there next to Willow Bend Way, just to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4190)|
| 1:09:54| the south, that right there. The person that owned that said no as well. And we spoke to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4194)|
| 1:10:01| Mr. Gordon as well on the condos that back up to us. And we had the most luck with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4201)|
| 1:10:10| But in the end, he said no as well. So we have reached out to try to explore a secondary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4210)|
| 1:10:18| drive, and we have been unsuccessful so far. Which would also bring us to Willow Bend Way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4218)|
| 1:10:26| but since we put our units, and if you go back to the aerial view, there's not enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4226)|
| 1:10:33| room to put a road in there. We maximized our units on that property already. And obviously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4233)|
| 1:10:39| we own that property. Knox Housing Partnership owns that property, and it would make sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4239)|
| 1:10:43| for us to move a road there, but the geography of it doesn't make it work well. We thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4243)|
| 1:10:50| possibly in the corner there onto the Karm parking lot, but again, like I said, the owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4250)|
| 1:10:54| declined. So that brings us to, you know, obviously we appreciate the staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4254)|
| 1:11:02| The only caveat there is we would really prefer to be at 12 units if we could. Again, going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4262)|
| 1:11:17| back to the fact that we fill up our senior units as quickly as we build them. And we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4277)|
| 1:11:24| have a two-year waiting list currently. We have about 120 senior units that Knox Housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4284)|
| 1:11:32| Partnership has built. Part of them are, there's a blueberry property, and then they're here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4292)|
| 1:11:39| clustered. Again, we're planning on doing senior units here. One story, most of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4299)|
| 1:11:45| are one bedroom. I know that people, especially in the neighborhood, have had concerns about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4305)|
| 1:11:51| the traffic, but seniors are not the ones who are out there driving up and down and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4311)|
| 1:11:56| speeding. And we, you know, we're certainly open to the possibility, if the county's open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4316)|
| 1:12:02| to it, of doing like speed humps or something like that on Clayberry as well. So we want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4322)|
| 1:12:07| to work with the neighborhood. We're actually considering in between now and the planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4327)|
| 1:12:10| commission to try to have a community meeting at our community building there at Willow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4330)|
| 1:12:17| to get to know the neighbors and to talk with them. So I think that's everything I had to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4337)|
| 1:12:22| say. You know, we're wanting to maximize the unit simply so that we can get more affordable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4342)|
| 1:12:27| housing for seniors out there. So that's our plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4347)|
| 1:12:30| Thank you, Mr. Harris. Commission? Vice Chair Uten?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4350)|
| 1:12:38| Yeah, I think if our access was different, we all would hope access would be different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4358)|
| 1:12:43| I think we would consider his request, but I think staff's got it right, and I'd like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4363)|
| 1:12:47| to make a motion that we approve one residential at one to eight per the acre per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4367)|
| 1:12:52| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4372)|
| 1:12:53| All right, we have a motion to approve plan residential for staff recommendation up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4373)|
| 1:13:01| 12 dwelling units per acre by, excuse me, eight dwelling units per acre by Vice Chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4381)|
| 1:13:07| Uten, seconded by Commissioner Schelso. Commissioner Midas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4387)|
| 1:13:12| I have a question for the applicant. So are you planning on using Clayberry Drive to access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4392)|
| 1:13:19| the lot then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4399)|
| 1:13:21| Yeah, I mean, that's the only access we currently have. When we purchased it before, the two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4401)|
| 1:13:27| houses that you see on there were actually used by Open Arms before they owned it. They| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4407)|
| 1:13:32| had a supportive living, two supportive living type houses there. But yeah, we don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4412)|
| 1:13:38| any. I mean, like I said, we've explored, you know, trying to find another access, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4418)|
| 1:13:44| we have not been able to do that successfully with any of the surrounding landowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4424)|
| 1:13:51| And Liz, could you comment a little bit on what Mr. Murphy's comment was about the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4431)|
| 1:13:58| that that density isn't allowed on a neighborhood street? And did y'all give that consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4438)|
| 1:14:03| in making the eight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4443)|
| 1:14:05| So he was referencing, I believe, the land use plan. So if you turn on the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4445)|
| 1:14:12| and look at this area, you can see that it is medium density residential. It's also adjacent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4452)|
| 1:14:20| to Harold Road, which is a classified road. Right Lane is a right road, is not a classified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4460)|
| 1:14:29| road, nor is Clayberry. If you turn the zoning map back on, you can see that there is some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4469)|
| 1:14:38| existing planned residential up to eight dwelling units per acre that has been approved for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4478)|
| 1:14:44| access onto Wright Road in the past. And I believe that rezoning happened in, like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4484)|
| 1:14:55| 1997.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4495)|
| 1:14:56| Which one? Can you point that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4496)|
| 1:14:59| That one. So that occurred in 1997.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4499)|
| 1:15:02| But Wright is a, is that a collector?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4502)|
| 1:15:05| No, it's not a classified street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4505)|
| 1:15:07| But this one is actually connecting to a neighborhood street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4507)|
| 1:15:10| Yes, but those are both local streets. They're both considered local streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4510)|
| 1:15:16| If there, if you turn on the major road plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4516)|
| 1:15:23| you can see where the colored lines are. Those are collectors or arterials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4523)|
| 1:15:28| Okay. So you're, you're comfortable with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4528)|
| 1:15:39| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4539)|
| 1:15:42| Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4542)|
| 1:15:44| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm kind of having flashbacks to the last couple months on a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4544)|
| 1:15:51| particular case we had where we basically had this exact same situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4551)|
| 1:15:56| And my question is, when the subdivision that's on Clayberry on either side was developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4556)|
| 1:16:06| was that set up as a connector to this property at that time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4566)|
| 1:16:18| I don't, I'm not privy to that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4578)|
| 1:16:22| I think that neighborhood was developed maybe in the 1950s or so. I doubt it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4582)|
| 1:16:28| I mean, right now the road provides access to those two lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4588)|
| 1:16:33| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4593)|
| 1:16:34| So it's not a cul-de-sac.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4594)|
| 1:16:36| It's not a cul-de-sac, so it is implied that it was going to have access to that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4596)|
| 1:16:41| Yeah, the right-of-way goes all the way to this property, to the two lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4601)|
| 1:16:47| So we're talking about allowing 40-some-odd units back there with traffic on Clayberry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4607)|
| 1:16:56| Yes, the senior living centers, as indicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4616)|
| 1:17:00| I'm not against senior living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4620)|
| 1:17:02| No, I understand, but it's 40 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4622)|
| 1:17:03| You know, we had a lot of conversation over the last one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4623)|
| 1:17:06| I totally agree, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4626)|
| 1:17:07| For two months, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4627)|
| 1:17:08| Yeah, but yes, it would be 40, up to 40 dwellings, almost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4628)|
| 1:17:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4631)|
| 1:17:16| Commissioner Midas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4636)|
| 1:17:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4640)|
| 1:17:21| So we have a motion to approve up to eight dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4641)|
| 1:17:25| Seeing no other lights, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4645)|
| 1:17:27| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4647)|
| 1:17:28| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4648)|
| 1:17:29| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4649)|
| 1:17:30| We have one no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4650)|
| 1:17:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4652)|
| 1:17:34| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4654)|
| 1:17:42| We'll move on to agenda item 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4662)|

| 1:18:14| I said two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4694)|
| 1:18:15| Up to two dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4695)|
| 1:18:19| Staff recommendation, this is going to require two motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4699)|
| 1:18:23| Approve this, is to approve the sector plan amendment to rural residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4703)|
| 1:18:28| because it is consistent with the development in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4708)|
| 1:18:32| And the second motion is, the recommendation is to approve planned residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4712)|

| 1:19:01| Do we have any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4741)|
| 1:19:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4742)|

| 1:19:07| I'd let him go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4747)|
| 1:19:09| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4749)|
| 1:19:10| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4750)|
| 1:19:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4751)|
| 1:19:12| Then they can go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4752)|

| 1:19:37| density requested, recommended, and what might be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4777)|
| 1:19:42| The applicants requested two dwelling units per acre in the planned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4782)|
| 1:19:49| residential zone here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4789)|
| 1:19:51| And in this case, the rezoning report contained a statement that the rural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4791)|
| 1:19:57| residential allows PR at one unit an acre in the northeast county sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4797)|
| 1:20:01| plan, which is an error as the growth policy plan allows two units an acre in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4801)|
| 1:20:05| the rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4805)|
| 1:20:06| So I'd like to talk about that for a little bit because that's a different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4806)|
| 1:20:10| interpretation and way that we've looked at this before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4810)|
| 1:20:15| So there's a couple of controlling laws around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4815)|
| 1:20:17| There is in Tennessee code when you have the growth plan requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4817)|
| 1:20:22| there's a law that says that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4822)|
| 1:20:24| after you pass the growth plan that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4824)|
| 1:20:27| regional plans and zoning needs to be compliant with the growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4827)|
| 1:20:30| So that's in Tennessee law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4830)|
| 1:20:31| So your zoning decisions and sector plan amendments need to be in compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4831)|
| 1:20:35| with the growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4835)|
| 1:20:36| We also in Knox County have a zoning ordinance under 6.30 that talks about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4836)|
| 1:20:41| amendments to the zone, which include map amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4841)|
| 1:20:44| So that's when you're considering a rezoning like here from ag to planned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4844)|
| 1:20:48| residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4848)|
| 1:20:49| And it says that, you know, under that Part D,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4849)|
| 1:20:52| this is on the first page of your handout,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4852)|
| 1:20:54| the proposed amendment shall be consistent with and not in conflict with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4854)|
| 1:20:58| general plan in Knoxville and Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4858)|
| 1:21:00| including any of its elements and sector plans are elements of the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4860)|
| 1:21:06| It goes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4866)|
| 1:21:07| It also refers to the land use plan and that's the map that we're used to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4867)|
| 1:21:10| seeing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4870)|
| 1:21:11| So that's when we're looking at the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4871)|
| 1:21:13| So that's how it kind of sets up your framework is you actually have to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4873)|
| 1:21:17| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4877)|
| 1:21:18| decisions need to be in compliance with the growth plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4878)|
| 1:21:21| the general plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4881)|
| 1:21:22| and the sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4882)|
| 1:21:23| And on the second page,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4883)|
| 1:21:24| you talk about it a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4884)|
| 1:21:26| We, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4886)|
| 1:21:27| kind of I've always viewed that one as that's a funnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4887)|
| 1:21:30| And if you've done strategic planning for your company or anything like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4890)|
| 1:21:34| you know that you start out with broad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4894)|
| 1:21:36| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4896)|
| 1:21:37| strategy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4897)|
| 1:21:38| mission statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4898)|
| 1:21:39| and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4899)|
| 1:21:40| That's at the very top layer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4900)|
| 1:21:41| It's very broad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4901)|
| 1:21:42| And that's kind of what our growth plan is for Knoxville or for Knox County is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4902)|
| 1:21:46| that's our broad statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4906)|
| 1:21:47| It kind of does some coordination between the municipalities in the county and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4907)|
| 1:21:51| sets out some broad policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4911)|
| 1:21:52| And then you get a little bit more specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4912)|
| 1:21:54| That's the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4914)|
| 1:21:56| And that gives you some more specific details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4916)|
| 1:21:59| In this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4919)|
| 1:22:00| on the second page,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4920)|
| 1:22:01| I pointed out that the growth plan has a statement 3.2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4921)|
| 1:22:08| It limits rezonings in the rural area to several districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4928)|
| 1:22:12| including planned residential at up to two units per acre based on septic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4932)|
| 1:22:16| And then it allows extensions of LDR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4936)|
| 1:22:19| one to three units if you meet those additional criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4939)|
| 1:22:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4942)|
| 1:22:23| So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4943)|
| 1:22:24| so far,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4944)|
| 1:22:25| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4945)|
| 1:22:26| rezoning up to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4946)|
| 1:22:27| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4947)|
| 1:22:28| two or three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4948)|
| 1:22:29| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4949)|
| 1:22:30| seems okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4950)|
| 1:22:31| And then you go down to the next level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4951)|
| 1:22:33| that general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4953)|
| 1:22:34| And that has policies that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4954)|
| 1:22:35| at least in the rural area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4955)|
| 1:22:37| reflect the growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4957)|
| 1:22:39| And it's consistent with it on the rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4959)|
| 1:22:41| You know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4961)|
| 1:22:42| it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4962)|
| 1:22:43| so it says low density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4963)|
| 1:22:45| one to three dwelling units in rural area with infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4965)|
| 1:22:49| And that infrastructure kind of refers you back to some specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4969)|
| 1:22:52| requirements of the growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4972)|
| 1:22:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4973)|
| 1:22:54| So we're,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4974)|
| 1:22:55| we're still good there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4975)|
| 1:22:56| But also note that the general plan goes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4976)|
| 1:22:58| and it defines some more policies around density and other areas of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4978)|
| 1:23:02| county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4982)|
| 1:23:03| like the urban growth area and the urban,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4983)|
| 1:23:05| and the planned growth area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4985)|
| 1:23:07| And we abide by those policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4987)|
| 1:23:08| That puts some limits on medium density and high density residential and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4988)|
| 1:23:11| things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4991)|
| 1:23:13| Finally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4993)|
| 1:23:14| we have sector plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4994)|
| 1:23:15| which are elements of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4995)|
| 1:23:17| And that provides even more specificity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=4997)|
| 1:23:20| In the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5000)|
| 1:23:21| they have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5001)|
| 1:23:22| each sector plan has a land use classification table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5002)|
| 1:23:25| And those are deliberately updated as part of each sector plan update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5005)|
| 1:23:29| I was at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5009)|
| 1:23:30| there were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5010)|
| 1:23:31| I think I was at six of the seven,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5011)|
| 1:23:33| or maybe it was five of seven meetings when the northeast county sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5013)|
| 1:23:37| plan was updated in the 2015 cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5017)|
| 1:23:40| And this classification table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5020)|
| 1:23:42| we looked at that density that said one unit per acre in the ag sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5022)|
| 1:23:46| plan and one unit per acre in the rural residential sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5026)|
| 1:23:50| That was something that was a deliberative process to adopt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5030)|
| 1:23:54| So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5034)|
| 1:23:55| and,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5035)|
| 1:23:56| and that's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5036)|
| 1:23:57| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5037)|
| 1:23:58| that's kind of like your most fine detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5038)|
| 1:24:00| And that places a limit on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5040)|
| 1:24:02| You are allowed to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5042)|
| 1:24:03| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5043)|
| 1:24:04| the growth plan would allow you to consider more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5044)|
| 1:24:06| but the sector plan puts a kind of final limit at that layer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5046)|
| 1:24:09| I think that's really important to understand is there is a deliberative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5049)|
| 1:24:12| process there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5052)|
| 1:24:13| Now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5053)|
| 1:24:14| if there is really perceived to be a true error in that plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5054)|
| 1:24:17| then the right way we'd suggest would be to actually sponsor a text| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5057)|
| 1:24:21| amendment to the sector plans to address that error.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5061)|
| 1:24:25| And that gives you public notice and public input and process on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5065)|
| 1:24:29| But we believe it was a deliberative choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5069)|
| 1:24:31| We believe one unit per acre is what is in the sector plan and controls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5071)|
| 1:24:35| the top limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5075)|
| 1:24:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5076)|
| 1:24:37| Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5077)|
| 1:24:38| Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5078)|
| 1:24:39| Shabat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5079)|
| 1:24:42| There was a lot of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5082)|
| 1:24:46| So before we purchased this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5086)|
| 1:24:50| we kind of got in touch with the staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5090)|
| 1:24:54| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5094)|
| 1:24:55| with the NPC staff and we had a different intention of what to build on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5095)|
| 1:24:59| it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5099)|
| 1:25:00| And after getting in touch with the staff and talking to them and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5100)|
| 1:25:03| explaining to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5103)|
| 1:25:04| they kind of put a limit and told us that this would be a better fit for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5104)|
| 1:25:09| what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5109)|
| 1:25:10| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5110)|

| 1:30:57| Actually, I'm on...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5457)|
| 1:30:58| I'm on...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5458)|
| 1:31:01| our side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5461)|
| 1:31:02| I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5462)|
| 1:31:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5465)|
| 1:31:06| When you go to the case file.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5466)|
| 1:31:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5470)|
| 1:31:11| Just how many copies we got on the case file?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5471)|
| 1:31:13| Two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5473)|
| 1:31:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5474)|
| 1:31:16| Can we take a five-minute recess?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5476)|
| 1:31:17| Let's get this...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5477)|
| 1:31:18| I'll tell you what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5478)|
| 1:31:19| Let's take a five-minute recess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5479)|
| 1:31:20| Good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5480)|
| 1:31:24| Order, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5484)|
| 1:31:25| And we'll pick back up on item 24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5485)|
| 1:31:30| And I think we were gonna have some opposition comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5490)|
| 1:31:43| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5503)|
| 1:31:49| Me and my wife live at 3104 Crenshaw Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5509)|
| 1:31:53| We've been there for about ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5513)|
| 1:31:55| And...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5515)|
| 1:31:56| And could you please state your name, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5516)|
| 1:31:58| Oh, my name is Robert Ray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5518)|
| 1:31:59| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5519)|
| 1:32:01| We've lived there for about ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5521)|
| 1:32:03| That road that we live on, Crenshaw Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5523)|
| 1:32:07| has a secondary road that goes by Ottinger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5527)|
| 1:32:10| And everyone who uses our road coming from Maryville Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5530)|
| 1:32:14| as it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5534)|
| 1:32:15| and they're trying to get to John Sevier Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5535)|
| 1:32:17| they come down our road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5537)|
| 1:32:20| Our road isn't considered a two-lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5540)|
| 1:32:22| because you literally have to get over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5542)|
| 1:32:24| in order to pass a car on that road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5544)|
| 1:32:27| which is Crenshaw Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5547)|
| 1:32:30| The amount of traffic that we get in the mornings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5550)|
| 1:32:34| sometimes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5554)|
| 1:32:35| we can't even pull out of our driveway as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5555)|
| 1:32:38| And what they're trying to submit there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5558)|
| 1:32:40| I don't know if they're going to face it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5560)|
| 1:32:42| towards, you know, Crenshaw Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5562)|
| 1:32:44| or if they're going to face it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5564)|
| 1:32:45| towards Maryville Pike or John Sevier Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5565)|
| 1:32:49| wherever the entrance is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5569)|
| 1:32:51| I don't think it would work on either of the roads there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5571)|
| 1:32:56| But as far as all the developing going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5576)|
| 1:32:59| in John Sevier Highway as it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5579)|
| 1:33:01| whenever you get to Alcoa Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5581)|
| 1:33:03| at 5 o'clock or 8 in the morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5583)|
| 1:33:05| is a dead standstill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5585)|
| 1:33:07| for at least 15 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5587)|
| 1:33:09| So I don't think that the idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5589)|
| 1:33:12| of putting more traffic in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5592)|
| 1:33:15| is going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5595)|
| 1:33:17| And later on down the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5597)|
| 1:33:19| I think they're building more apartments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5599)|
| 1:33:21| two miles down the road on John Sevier Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5601)|
| 1:33:24| And then there's apartments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5604)|
| 1:33:25| on Alcoa Highway going up already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5605)|
| 1:33:28| The school district alone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5608)|
| 1:33:31| for where our son goes to school at South Dual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5611)|
| 1:33:36| is already at full capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5616)|
| 1:33:39| So we don't really see how we can have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5619)|
| 1:33:42| any more of that going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5622)|
| 1:33:45| But we're wanting to oppose it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5625)|
| 1:33:47| because we didn't think it would be a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5627)|
| 1:33:49| None of our neighbors agree with this either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5629)|
| 1:33:52| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5632)|
| 1:33:54| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5634)|
| 1:34:00| Mr. Dickert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5640)|
| 1:34:02| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5642)|
| 1:34:04| We did plan on having one entrance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5644)|
| 1:34:06| into the complex itself on Crenshaw Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5646)|
| 1:34:09| To deal with the school problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5649)|
| 1:34:11| we've also entertained the act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5651)|
| 1:34:13| of just senior living, 55 and over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5653)|
| 1:34:17| But with the numbers Knoxville is seeing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5657)|
| 1:34:20| people move into overall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5660)|
| 1:34:22| I think it would be a pretty good idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5662)|
| 1:34:24| to move it to a medium density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5664)|
| 1:34:26| and have the 48 moderate unit townhomes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5666)|
| 1:34:30| as you guys see on the pieces of paper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5670)|
| 1:34:32| that we have printed out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5672)|
| 1:34:33| that the engineers put out for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5673)|
| 1:34:35| That's all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5675)|
| 1:34:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5676)|
| 1:34:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5677)|
| 1:34:38| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5678)|
| 1:34:40| Just a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5680)|
| 1:34:41| Based on the preliminary drawings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5681)|
| 1:34:43| that you just gave us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5683)|
| 1:34:45| I don't see any road connection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5685)|
| 1:34:47| to Crenshaw Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5687)|
| 1:34:50| From what we were told,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5690)|
| 1:34:52| we would have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5692)|
| 1:34:54| We'd have to have one essentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5694)|
| 1:34:58| As we further developed it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5698)|
| 1:35:00| that could possibly change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5700)|
| 1:35:02| I know they were pointing on two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5702)|
| 1:35:03| out to John Sevier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5703)|
| 1:35:04| to eliminate Crenshaw Road entirely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5704)|
| 1:35:10| I will agree with the opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5710)|
| 1:35:12| Crenshaw Road is extremely narrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5712)|
| 1:35:14| It's a very narrow road, yes sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5714)|
| 1:35:16| My question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5716)|
| 1:35:17| now I'm going to ask Jim Snowden a question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5717)|
| 1:35:19| because he was playing Pac-Man earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5719)|
| 1:35:21| and he needs something to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5721)|
| 1:35:22| in this meeting I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5722)|
| 1:35:23| No, I'm just kidding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5723)|
| 1:35:25| Looking ahead,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5725)|
| 1:35:26| Crenshaw Road has a weird intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5726)|
| 1:35:29| already with Maryville Pike there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5729)|
| 1:35:34| Does the county have any plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5734)|
| 1:35:35| for any width widening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5735)|
| 1:35:38| of any of that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5738)|
| 1:35:39| or trying to fix Crenshaw?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5739)|
| 1:35:41| Because I know down on the other side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5741)|
| 1:35:43| of Crenshaw,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5743)|
| 1:35:44| they're fixing that down there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5744)|
| 1:35:45| around Alcoa Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5745)|
| 1:35:46| and all that stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5746)|
| 1:35:48| No, no sir, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5748)|
| 1:35:50| We don't have any improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5750)|
| 1:35:52| Both intersections on Crenshaw| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5752)|
| 1:35:54| at both John Sevier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5754)|
| 1:35:55| and Maryville Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5755)|
| 1:35:57| are not ideal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5757)|
| 1:35:59| TDOT does have some safety improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5759)|
| 1:36:02| that they're going to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5762)|
| 1:36:03| along John Sevier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5763)|
| 1:36:04| and add a left turn lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5764)|
| 1:36:05| into that mountain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5765)|
| 1:36:09| The one where the senior center is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5769)|
| 1:36:11| they are going to do some repaving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5771)|
| 1:36:13| there at the loop road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5773)|
| 1:36:15| Circle Oak I think it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5775)|
| 1:36:17| So TDOT does have some improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5777)|
| 1:36:19| there along John Sevier Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5779)|
| 1:36:21| but neither of our agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5781)|
| 1:36:24| have any improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5784)|
| 1:36:25| to Crenshaw Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5785)|
| 1:36:28| And again, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5788)|
| 1:36:30| I think eventually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5790)|
| 1:36:31| something's going to come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5791)|
| 1:36:34| Looking at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5794)|
| 1:36:35| knowing where that little road is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5795)|
| 1:36:36| that circle loop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5796)|
| 1:36:37| that goes over to the senior center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5797)|
| 1:36:39| where I'm looking at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5799)|
| 1:36:41| it feels like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5801)|
| 1:36:42| all of the entrances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5802)|
| 1:36:43| are not aligned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5803)|
| 1:36:44| for optimal entry and exit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5804)|
| 1:36:46| especially on John Sevier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5806)|
| 1:36:48| Knowing Crenshaw Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5808)|
| 1:36:50| I'm not saying no forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5810)|
| 1:36:52| I'd like to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5812)|
| 1:36:53| a little bit more concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5813)|
| 1:36:56| around how you're going to move people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5816)|
| 1:36:58| in and out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5818)|
| 1:36:59| because I just don't see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5819)|
| 1:37:00| a safe mechanism right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5820)|
| 1:37:02| that would give me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5822)|
| 1:37:03| comfortability to approve this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5823)|
| 1:37:06| just based on some of the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5826)|
| 1:37:08| that I'm looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5828)|
| 1:37:09| Again, I know there's housing needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5829)|
| 1:37:11| and stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5831)|
| 1:37:12| I'm just concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5832)|
| 1:37:16| I mean, John Sevier Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5836)|
| 1:37:17| it's not going to slow down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5837)|
| 1:37:18| It's not getting any lighter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5838)|
| 1:37:19| even with the improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5839)|
| 1:37:20| we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5840)|
| 1:37:21| There's no signalization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5841)|
| 1:37:23| right there on John Sevier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5843)|
| 1:37:24| So I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5844)|
| 1:37:25| once Alcoa Highway is fixed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5845)|
| 1:37:26| you're going to have people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5846)|
| 1:37:27| flying down through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5847)|
| 1:37:30| That's just some of the concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5850)|
| 1:37:31| I've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5851)|
| 1:37:32| just as I've looked at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5852)|
| 1:37:34| and knowing the challenges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5854)|
| 1:37:35| that Crenshaw Road has there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5855)|
| 1:37:38| So that's just my two cents worth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5858)|
| 1:37:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5862)|
| 1:37:43| Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5863)|
| 1:37:47| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5867)|
| 1:37:49| I have some of the same concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5869)|
| 1:37:50| that Commissioner Smith does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5870)|
| 1:37:51| but when we discussed this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5871)|
| 1:37:53| at agenda review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5873)|
| 1:37:54| I asked the question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5874)|
| 1:37:55| about when we would see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5875)|
| 1:37:57| those entrances, exits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5877)|
| 1:38:00| and tell me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5880)|
| 1:38:02| but I thought that's coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5882)|
| 1:38:03| in a later plan that we would see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5883)|
| 1:38:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5886)|
| 1:38:08| I have a comment about the buffer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5888)|
| 1:38:11| and I would be interested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5891)|
| 1:38:13| in adjusting the requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5893)|
| 1:38:17| for the buffer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5897)|
| 1:38:18| that is against John Sevier Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5898)|
| 1:38:21| to have that be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5901)|
| 1:38:22| the current vegetation that's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5902)|
| 1:38:25| So instead of raising that entire area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5905)|
| 1:38:27| retain the vegetation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5907)|
| 1:38:28| that does exist there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5908)|
| 1:38:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5911)|
| 1:38:33| So roughly how many feet were you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5913)|
| 1:38:36| The buffer zone is defined already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5916)|
| 1:38:39| so that is in staff's recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5919)|
| 1:38:42| but I'm asking that that not be raised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5922)|
| 1:38:47| and then replanted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5927)|
| 1:38:49| but leave what is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5929)|
| 1:38:51| So non-disturbed area, that buffer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5931)|
| 1:38:54| which is 50 feet, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5934)|
| 1:38:58| 50?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5938)|
| 1:38:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5939)|
| 1:39:01| Because I know we had mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5941)|
| 1:39:04| the 25-foot setback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5944)|
| 1:39:06| and 35-foot setbacks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5946)|
| 1:39:08| that were in place already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5948)|
| 1:39:09| and we planned on fully following| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5949)|
| 1:39:11| those requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5951)|
| 1:39:12| There's a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5952)|
| 1:39:13| Someone's going to have to tell me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5953)|
| 1:39:14| the exact name of the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5954)|
| 1:39:17| John Sevier Corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5957)|
| 1:39:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5958)|
| 1:39:19| And that calls out a 50-foot buffer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5959)|
| 1:39:24| against John Sevier Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5964)|
| 1:39:26| to protect that corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5966)|
| 1:39:29| So that's already there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5969)|
| 1:39:31| but my interest is maintaining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5971)|
| 1:39:33| the tree buffer that already exists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5973)|
| 1:39:36| so it would not disturb that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5976)|
| 1:39:38| That 50-foot would remain undisturbed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5978)|
| 1:39:40| so that's just the difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5980)|
| 1:39:42| of what plants are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5982)|
| 1:39:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5984)|
| 1:39:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5988)|
| 1:39:49| Commissioner Schelso.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5989)|
| 1:39:52| I'd like to make a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5992)|
| 1:39:53| to approve the sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5993)|
| 1:39:54| to MDR because it provides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5994)|
| 1:39:55| a transitional land use designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5995)|
| 1:39:57| from the commercial node.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=5997)|
| 1:40:00| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6000)|
| 1:40:03| We have a motion from Commissioner Schelso| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6003)|
| 1:40:06| to approve the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6006)|
| 1:40:07| to MDR per staff recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6007)|
| 1:40:09| seconded by Vice Chair Uten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6009)|
| 1:40:11| We have more discussion here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6011)|
| 1:40:13| Let's go to Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6013)|
| 1:40:15| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6015)|
| 1:40:17| So the way I'm reading this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6017)|
| 1:40:18| this will come back to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6018)|
| 1:40:21| the concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6021)|
| 1:40:22| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6022)|
| 1:40:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6023)|
| 1:40:24| So we have an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6024)|
| 1:40:25| to look at what they're planning on doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6025)|
| 1:40:28| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6028)|
| 1:40:32| Vice Chair Uten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6032)|
| 1:40:34| Yeah, I was just going to piggyback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6034)|
| 1:40:38| a little bit off of Commissioner Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6038)|
| 1:40:40| and Commissioner Adams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6040)|
| 1:40:42| that as we go through that concept plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6042)|
| 1:40:45| I think not only leaving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6045)|
| 1:40:46| the 50-foot undisturbed buffer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6046)|
| 1:40:47| but I think staff ought to be looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6047)|
| 1:40:49| at supplemental in case there's areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6049)|
| 1:40:51| that aren't fully vegetated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6051)|
| 1:40:54| I think that would be appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6054)|
| 1:40:55| as we look at the concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6055)|
| 1:40:57| And then Mr. Snowden's obviously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6057)|
| 1:40:58| going to look at that intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6058)|
| 1:41:00| and access points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6060)|
| 1:41:01| and if there's any intersection improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6061)|
| 1:41:03| that need to happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6063)|
| 1:41:04| or widening or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6064)|
| 1:41:06| I think we would have an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6066)|
| 1:41:07| to look at that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6067)|
| 1:41:09| So I would make a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6069)|
| 1:41:13| to approve the plan residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6073)|
| 1:41:15| Yeah, we've already got a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6075)|
| 1:41:16| Now you can talk to your colleague over there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6076)|
| 1:41:19| and see if he wants to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6079)|
| 1:41:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6081)|
| 1:41:22| Actually, can I ask, Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6082)|
| 1:41:25| when you said we'd have a chance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6085)|
| 1:41:26| to talk about that buffer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6086)|
| 1:41:28| are you implying that we wouldn't need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6088)|
| 1:41:30| for me to make a specific notion here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6090)|
| 1:41:33| No, I think this buffer says that there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6093)|
| 1:41:35| or this zoning would be contingent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6095)|
| 1:41:37| on that buffer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6097)|
| 1:41:38| and they can't clear or grade or do anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6098)|
| 1:41:41| until the concept plan is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6101)|
| 1:41:42| So what I'm saying is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6102)|
| 1:41:43| they can't touch anything out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6103)|
| 1:41:45| until the concept plan comes through us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6105)|
| 1:41:47| And at that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6107)|
| 1:41:48| the concept plan and the development plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6108)|
| 1:41:49| we can put an additional stipulation on there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6109)|
| 1:41:52| that says to supplement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6112)|
| 1:41:53| if staff feels that there's areas there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6113)|
| 1:41:55| that aren't adequately vegetated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6115)|
| 1:41:58| So I think we're good with the way it's written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6118)|
| 1:42:01| Okay, so we're voting on the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6121)|
| 1:42:04| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6124)|
| 1:42:05| Yeah, and I just want to clarify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6125)|
| 1:42:06| because I feel like today I'm just stirring a mud hole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6126)|
| 1:42:09| to keep everybody just confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6129)|
| 1:42:11| My comments were based off the piece of paper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6131)|
| 1:42:14| that he handed out when we first started this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6134)|
| 1:42:17| and I know this is not before us right this minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6137)|
| 1:42:20| I was making comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6140)|
| 1:42:22| based on what I was seeing initially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6142)|
| 1:42:25| for them to take into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6145)|
| 1:42:27| I'm not opposed to us going ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6147)|
| 1:42:29| and doing what we're doing today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6149)|
| 1:42:30| I'm more giving feedback based on what I see here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6150)|
| 1:42:33| and raising some concerns ahead of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6153)|
| 1:42:36| for everybody to be aware of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6156)|
| 1:42:38| especially the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6158)|
| 1:42:41| Okay, so we have a motion and a second on the floor here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6161)|
| 1:42:45| to approve the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6165)|
| 1:42:47| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6167)|
| 1:42:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6168)|
| 1:42:49| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6169)|
| 1:42:50| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6170)|
| 1:42:52| Chair will entertain a motion on the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6172)|
| 1:42:57| I'll make a motion to approve the rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6177)|
| 1:43:00| up to the request of 12 units an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6180)|
| 1:43:04| with the same conditions that staff recommends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6184)|
| 1:43:09| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6189)|
| 1:43:12| Did you say 12?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6192)|
| 1:43:13| I remember 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6193)|
| 1:43:15| Staff recommendation was 8, but just so you're aware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6195)|
| 1:43:19| And his recommendation is 12, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6199)|
| 1:43:22| 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6202)|
| 1:43:23| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6203)|
| 1:43:26| I can elaborate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6206)|
| 1:43:27| I think it's a decent location for a little more density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6207)|
| 1:43:31| with the access to the roads that it has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6211)|
| 1:43:33| You've also got RB zoning up and down there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6213)|
| 1:43:35| which can get a special use approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6215)|
| 1:43:37| from 12 to 24 units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6217)|
| 1:43:40| I don't think it's all that out of place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6220)|
| 1:43:43| on how that area is going to develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6223)|
| 1:43:48| Okay, so we have a motion by Commissioner Schelso,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6228)|
| 1:43:51| seconded by Commissioner Huber| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6231)|
| 1:43:53| to approve the planned residential zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6233)|
| 1:43:55| up to 12 dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6235)|
| 1:43:59| and the rest of it would be per staff recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6239)|
| 1:44:04| with those two conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6244)|
| 1:44:08| And it looks like we have a lot on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6248)|
| 1:44:10| Commissioner Huber?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6250)|
| 1:44:12| Yeah, I would agree with Commissioner Schelso.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6252)|
| 1:44:14| I mean, this is at a large intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6254)|
| 1:44:17| where that's really where we're trying to push| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6257)|
| 1:44:19| all the densities and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6259)|
| 1:44:21| with advanced NOx and things like that in mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6261)|
| 1:44:24| commercial hubs, corners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6264)|
| 1:44:27| But you've got two pretty good-sized roads right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6267)|
| 1:44:29| I don't know what John Severe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6269)|
| 1:44:32| I'm sure it's a major arterial, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6272)|
| 1:44:36| So, I mean, that's the question will be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6276)|
| 1:44:38| yeah, how can you access it safely?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6278)|
| 1:44:40| And we'll cross those bridges as we talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6280)|
| 1:44:44| But from a density standpoint, from a zoning perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6284)|
| 1:44:46| I think it's appropriate at 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6286)|
| 1:44:49| Okay. Commissioner Phillips?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6289)|
| 1:44:51| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6291)|
| 1:44:52| Yeah, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6292)|
| 1:44:53| I'm fine with the 12 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6293)|
| 1:44:55| I am concerned about the access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6295)|
| 1:44:57| and I realize that that's going to come later down the pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6297)|
| 1:45:00| A question for Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6300)|
| 1:45:02| Ideally, where would you want to see access for this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6302)|
| 1:45:06| on Maryville Pike or John Severe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6306)|
| 1:45:09| We would certainly prefer it to be on the state route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6309)|
| 1:45:12| Crenshaw, as Commissioner Smith said, is very narrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6312)|
| 1:45:16| Both intersections on either end are problematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6316)|
| 1:45:19| So, I mean, potentially you could line it up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6319)|
| 1:45:22| if the state would agree to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6322)|
| 1:45:23| with the ramp that goes to John Severe Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6323)|
| 1:45:26| near the Weigels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6326)|
| 1:45:28| That would eliminate some of your conflict points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6328)|
| 1:45:30| and your spacing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6330)|
| 1:45:31| so that would probably be the optimal location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6331)|
| 1:45:34| Yeah, from my perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6334)|
| 1:45:36| if a plan comes in here with access on Crenshaw,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6336)|
| 1:45:39| I'll probably vote against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6339)|
| 1:45:41| But I'll support the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6341)|
| 1:45:44| Commissioner Midas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6344)|
| 1:45:46| I'd like to hear from Liz regarding why she recommended 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6346)|
| 1:45:51| I still can't pull up the case file| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6351)|
| 1:45:54| to see what your rationale is for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6354)|
| 1:46:01| So we were looking at how this is a transitional area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6361)|
| 1:46:06| It is along John Severe Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6366)|
| 1:46:08| and it is immediately adjacent to single-family residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6368)|
| 1:46:14| So that 8 seemed to be a little bit more in keeping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6374)|
| 1:46:18| with the transitional land use than up to 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6378)|
| 1:46:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6385)|
| 1:46:37| Do you know what the density is on that adjacent CA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6397)|
| 1:46:41| That's on the other side, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6401)|
| 1:46:44| Are those apartments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6404)|
| 1:46:47| Those are commercial buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6407)|
| 1:46:49| Oh, those are commercial. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6409)|
| 1:46:51| That's at Weigel's convenience store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6411)|
| 1:47:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6423)|
| 1:47:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6424)|
| 1:47:05| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6425)|
| 1:47:06| And just because, as I've learned, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6426)|
| 1:47:10| sometimes especially for those that have spoken in opposition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6430)|
| 1:47:13| I want to just make sure you understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6433)|
| 1:47:15| that there were two conditions that staff put on there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6435)|
| 1:47:19| that were leaving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6439)|
| 1:47:20| The second one is most important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6440)|
| 1:47:22| which is even if we approve this today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6442)|
| 1:47:24| that no clearing or grading of the site is permitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6444)|
| 1:47:28| until the concept plan or use on review has been approved by us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6448)|
| 1:47:31| So even what we're doing today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6451)|
| 1:47:33| they can't go in and start clearing anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6453)|
| 1:47:35| until we actually see how they're going to do the concept plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6455)|
| 1:47:38| where it's going to connect, and we approve all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6458)|
| 1:47:40| So I just want to make sure you all are aware that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6460)|
| 1:47:42| they're not going to start knocking down trees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6462)|
| 1:47:44| because they can't based on what our staff...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6464)|
| 1:47:46| And I'm going to go ahead and forecast into the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6466)|
| 1:47:49| just so that, you know, everybody knows where I'm at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6469)|
| 1:47:51| because I'm in alignment with Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6471)|
| 1:47:54| You know, I'd really like to see this connect in right there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6474)|
| 1:47:58| at Old Maryville Pike where...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6478)|
| 1:48:00| In Maryville Pike, that little ramp connects in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6480)|
| 1:48:03| I think that would be the safest route| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6483)|
| 1:48:05| because, again, Crenshaw does this weird,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6485)|
| 1:48:07| angled crossing of Maryville Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6487)|
| 1:48:10| It's narrow, it's unsafe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6490)|
| 1:48:12| I don't think John Sevier is the right place for this to go into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6492)|
| 1:48:16| just based on everything else going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6496)|
| 1:48:18| so I'm going ahead and giving you some information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6498)|
| 1:48:20| to take back to the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6500)|
| 1:48:21| as you all are coming up with the final concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6501)|
| 1:48:24| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6504)|
| 1:48:28| Okay, so we have a motion for 12 dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6508)|
| 1:48:35| plan residential, seeing no other lights, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6515)|
| 1:48:39| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6519)|
| 1:48:40| Any opposed? Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6520)|
| 1:48:43| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6523)|
| 1:48:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6524)|
| 1:48:50| On to item 27.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6530)|
| 1:48:54| This will require two motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6534)|
| 1:48:55| The applicant is Aziz Karani.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6535)|
| 1:48:58| Location, southwest side of Strawberry Plain Spike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6538)|
| 1:49:01| and East Governor John Sevier Highway, 8.68 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6541)|
| 1:49:07| Present plan designation and zoning is medium density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6547)|
| 1:49:11| light industrial, low density residential, stream protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6551)|
| 1:49:14| agricultural, and the floodway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6554)|
| 1:49:17| Proposed plan designation and zoning, general commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6557)|
| 1:49:20| stream protection, general business, general residential, and floodway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6560)|
| 1:49:25| Existing land use is rural residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6565)|
| 1:49:30| Staff recommendation is to approve the sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6570)|
| 1:49:33| to general commercial and stream protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6573)|
| 1:49:37| for a portion of parcel 083082| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6577)|
| 1:49:40| because it is a minor extension at an existing commercial node.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6580)|
| 1:49:44| Motion two, recommendation is to approve the general business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6584)|
| 1:49:48| and general residential and floodway zones for portions of parcel 083082| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6588)|
| 1:49:54| because it is a minor extension of an existing commercial node| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6594)|
| 1:49:57| and consistent with the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6597)|
| 1:50:00| Is the applicant available?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6600)|
| 1:50:02| The applicant is not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6602)|
| 1:50:04| I'm representing him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6604)|
| 1:50:05| James Smith, 2160 Lakeside Center Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6605)|
| 1:50:09| Do we have opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6609)|
| 1:50:13| Would you like to proceed or would you defer to the opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6613)|
| 1:50:16| Defer would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6616)|
| 1:50:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6617)|
| 1:50:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6618)|
| 1:50:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6619)|
| 1:50:34| Kevin Murphy, 4508 Murphy Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6634)|
| 1:50:37| I understand that they're asking for CA zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6637)|
| 1:50:40| This is adjacent to existing residential and also incorporates residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6640)|
| 1:50:45| It seems that neighborhood commercial is absolutely the kind of uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6645)|
| 1:50:51| and design standards that you want next to residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6651)|
| 1:50:54| so we'd urge you to adopt neighborhood commercial instead of the CA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6654)|
| 1:50:59| for that portion of this request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6659)|
| 1:51:01| Thank you, Mr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6661)|
| 1:51:02| Mr. Weber?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6662)|
| 1:51:05| Yes, good day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6665)|
| 1:51:06| Good day, ladies and gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6666)|
| 1:51:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6667)|
| 1:51:09| My wife and I have lived on Strawberry Plains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6669)|
| 1:51:11| Mr. Weber, if you don't mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6671)|
| 1:51:12| if you'll state your first and last name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6672)|
| 1:51:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6675)|
| 1:51:16| My name is John Weber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6676)|
| 1:51:18| I live at 5443 Strawberry Plains Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6678)|
| 1:51:23| This is directly across the street from the proposed development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6683)|
| 1:51:30| We've lived there since 1986,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6690)|
| 1:51:33| and it's directly across from the soccer park also, our road frontage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6693)|
| 1:51:39| And we're really close to that development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6699)|
| 1:51:46| and on paper the development plan seems to look okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6706)|
| 1:51:51| but there are several serious issues we think we need to review before a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6711)|
| 1:51:55| decision to change the sector plan or to rezone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6715)|
| 1:51:59| The main reason this area has not been developed is that the closest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6719)|
| 1:52:03| connection to KUB sewer is about a mile away at Thorn Grove Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6723)|
| 1:52:09| and its intersection with Governor John Severe Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6729)|
| 1:52:14| Now, there is the owner, Mr. Karani,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6734)|
| 1:52:18| told our neighbor who lives adjacent to this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6738)|
| 1:52:23| directly adjacent to this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6743)|
| 1:52:26| told him that he had thought the property had sewer when he purchased the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6746)|
| 1:52:32| property, when he was contemplating development, I suppose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6752)|
| 1:52:38| Additionally, the property's closest one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6758)|
| 1:52:41| Palm Creek on Strawberry Plains Pike and John Severe Highway, routinely flood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6761)|
| 1:52:46| We posted numerous photographs that you can review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6766)|
| 1:52:50| and I hope you will review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6770)|
| 1:52:52| The resolution didn't come through quite like we'd hoped,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6772)|
| 1:52:55| but you can easily see how much flooding goes on with Swan Pond Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6775)|
| 1:53:01| And we have about three or four different floods recorded in those photographs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6781)|
| 1:53:09| but there have been many more that we have not recorded in photographs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6789)|
| 1:53:14| Some of them we did record many, many years ago on 35-millimeter film,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6794)|
| 1:53:20| and who knows where that stuff is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6800)|
| 1:53:23| These were relatively accessible on our computer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6803)|
| 1:53:29| This flooding is being caused by infill, continuous infill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6809)|
| 1:53:37| along Swan Pond Creek and in the area between the intersection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6817)|
| 1:53:45| John Severe and Strawberry Plains Pike, and the industrial park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6825)|
| 1:53:49| It's been infilled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6829)|
| 1:53:51| That is, they come along and fill the place with dirt and concrete| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6831)|
| 1:53:55| and bring it up to level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6835)|
| 1:53:58| The whole area has been essentially a swamp since Mr. Ramsey built his stone house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6838)|
| 1:54:06| down the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6846)|
| 1:54:12| This flooding will continue to cause problems along Swan Pond Creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6852)|
| 1:54:18| all the way to its confluence with the Holston River.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6858)|
| 1:54:26| Planning staff recommended approval based on other commercial properties being nearby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6866)|
| 1:54:31| Yeah, they're commercial properties, but it's not exactly true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6871)|
| 1:54:35| At the intersection, the Mr. Zip Shell gasoline station is commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6875)|
| 1:54:42| The Retro Taco has a very small lot that is also commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6882)|
| 1:54:49| but that lot has most of the frontage that this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6889)|
| 1:54:53| that Mr. Kobani's property would need to put in driveways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6893)|
| 1:55:02| access for automobiles and other vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6902)|
| 1:55:13| The southeastern corner across at the intersection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6913)|
| 1:55:16| the southeastern corner across from Mr. Zip is still zoned agricultural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6916)|
| 1:55:22| with the sector plan of LDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6922)|
| 1:55:25| In the opposite corner of this property next to Swan Pond Creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6925)|
| 1:55:29| that is at the southeastern corner next to Swan Pond Creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6929)|
| 1:55:33| that one is a planned commercial zone rather than being a C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6933)|
| 1:55:44| Much of that property along Strawberry Plains Pike toward the interstate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6944)|
| 1:55:51| was zoned commercial many, many years ago when there was a dairy there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6951)|
| 1:55:56| There's a radio tower there, and they have lots of flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6956)|
| 1:56:04| If you would, please wrap up. Our rules require you to wrap it up, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6964)|
| 1:56:08| Will do. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6968)|
| 1:56:12| The buffer for residential property directly adjacent to the applicant's property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6972)|
| 1:56:18| doesn't seem to be addressed at all in this sector plan change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6978)|
| 1:56:26| Rezoning needs to be a planned effort, not just a blanket change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6986)|
| 1:56:38| That's all I have. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=6998)|
| 1:56:41| Applicant May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7001)|
| 1:56:42| I'm the other half of him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7002)|
| 1:56:44| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7004)|
| 1:56:45| My name is Delaine Weber. I just wanted to point out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7005)|
| 1:56:47| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7007)|
| 1:56:48| First of all, we only have a total of five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7008)|
| 1:56:51| Unless I'll look around to my colleagues here if they want to give you additional time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7011)|
| 1:56:58| I'll tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7018)|
| 1:56:59| I think a half minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7019)|
| 1:57:00| Mr. Sheltzer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7020)|
| 1:57:01| One minute, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7021)|
| 1:57:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7023)|
| 1:57:04| I just wanted to point out the proposed development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7024)|
| 1:57:06| If you've looked at the last page, the commercial part has 100 parking places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7026)|
| 1:57:12| The residential has 70 units with 150 parking places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7032)|
| 1:57:17| That's 250 cars coming out of this small corner along with the other commercial areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7037)|
| 1:57:24| Lots of driveways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7044)|
| 1:57:26| And again, we pointed out that the drive, the entrance and exit that's drawn on the plan by engineering company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7046)|
| 1:57:33| and I guess he can explain, is very close to the creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7053)|
| 1:57:36| It's the real estate description says that there's 50 feet of this property on John Severe Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7056)|
| 1:57:45| So there's no room to put an entrance and exit on John Severe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7065)|
| 1:57:48| So now we have all of the cars, 250 potential cars, multiple times a day coming up that close on Strawberry Plains Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7068)|
| 1:57:56| You've got the oil restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7076)|
| 1:57:57| You've got the gas station, other driveways, and the soccer park that gets, it's a youth soccer park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7077)|

| 1:58:05| You've got cars that line up too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7085)|
| 1:58:06| So, and there's a little one-lane road, Jim Armstrong Road, that's going to be used as a shortcut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7086)|
| 1:58:11| It's between John Severe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7091)|
| 1:58:14| We can see that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7094)|
| 1:58:15| And we're just creating a lot of accidents for people who are going to live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7095)|
| 1:58:19| Or, you know, it's too intense, much too intense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7099)|
| 1:58:22| Our suggestion, mine, is that it needs to be postponed so that the owner can make, you know, make some other plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7102)|
| 1:58:31| Look at his.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7111)|
| 1:58:32| And that's what he said to our neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7112)|
| 1:58:33| He said, I need to get back with my team because he thought he had sewer on this property when he bought it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7113)|
| 1:58:39| And he does not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7119)|
| 1:58:40| And TDEC told us there's no way that you can put a septic system for this level of intensity of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7120)|
| 1:58:48| So, I think there needs to be some postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7128)|
| 1:58:51| You asked for 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7131)|
| 1:58:52| We gave you a minute and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7132)|
| 1:58:53| You're a good negotiator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7133)|
| 1:58:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7134)|
| 1:59:00| If you need a little more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7140)|
| 1:59:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7142)|
| 1:59:03| You'll get equal time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7143)|
| 1:59:04| I would like to touch on a few subjects there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7144)|
| 1:59:06| The sanitary sewer, Mr. Crony did believe that it was available at the site when he purchased it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7146)|
| 1:59:13| We've discovered it is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7153)|
| 1:59:14| It is located 4,000 feet south of there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7154)|
| 1:59:18| We would work with, Mr. Crony would work with KUB to extend that to the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7158)|
| 1:59:23| That's what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7163)|
| 1:59:24| I'm a civil engineer, so that's not a major stumbling point here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7164)|
| 1:59:29| The flooding stormwater that is demonstrated historically, we would develop this site within the Knox County stormwater ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7169)|
| 1:59:37| They've got a very robust ordinance, and we develop within there to control peak flows and water quality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7177)|
| 1:59:45| And I wanted to mention that the proposed plan that is in the application, that was Mr. Crony's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7185)|
| 1:59:53| That's a concept plan to see what we could potentially do with that property to kind of indicate his intentions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7193)|
| 2:00:00| He would have to work with or intends to work with the taco restaurant there for access and possibly, you know, clean up some driveways there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7200)|
| 2:00:13| So if you had any other questions, I'd be happy to answer, but I think that's all the time I needed to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7213)|
| 2:00:19| I think you mentioned something about the sewer, but I didn't hear it clearly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7219)|
| 2:00:22| What did you say about the sewer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7222)|
| 2:00:23| The area is in the KUB sanitary sewer district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7223)|
| 2:00:27| It is not available immediately at the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7227)|
| 2:00:30| About three quarters of a mile to the south is their closest sewer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7230)|
| 2:00:35| So we would work with KUB to extend it to the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7235)|
| 2:00:41| That's the intention for development up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7241)|
| 2:00:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7246)|
| 2:00:47| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7247)|
| 2:00:51| I'm just concerned about I looked at the concept plan or the draft concept plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7251)|
| 2:00:57| and when I think about that in conjunction with the numerous pictures that we were sent with the flooding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7257)|
| 2:01:07| this was a little bit different than some of the flooding pictures we get, which are like some standing water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7267)|
| 2:01:12| The pictures included like rushing water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7272)|
| 2:01:14| This seemed like an intense, more intense than a lot of things that we will see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7274)|
| 2:01:18| But when I think about that flooding scenario with the concept plan, which has, as one of the opponents spoke about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7278)|
| 2:01:27| the number of parking spaces that are required for the potential plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7287)|
| 2:01:33| that's a lot of asphalt or concrete that is not going to be helping that water scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7293)|
| 2:01:40| So I'm not against redevelopment of the area or even putting some commercial there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7300)|
| 2:01:48| I'm very concerned about this particular plan, and there seem to be some components that are not fully baked yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7308)|
| 2:01:55| I'm, at this moment, not feeling very favorable about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7315)|
| 2:01:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7318)|
| 2:02:00| Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7320)|
| 2:02:01| Thank you, Chairman Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7321)|
| 2:02:03| Could staff point out where the general business and general residential areas are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7323)|
| 2:02:09| What portions will be zoned accordingly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7329)|
| 2:02:13| If you could, sorry, if we could look at the staff report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7333)|
| 2:02:19| There is an exhibit attached to it that the applicant provided showing the line where they're requesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7339)|
| 2:02:33| So this is, or that was it, the one you just passed, the large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7353)|
| 2:02:38| So this is oriented a little differently than what we were looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7358)|
| 2:02:44| But you can see at the corner of the major intersection there where the retro taco is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7364)|
| 2:02:52| So that would be an extension into that blue area of that CA zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7372)|
| 2:03:00| And the rear portion of that property that's highlighted in like an orange-red would be RB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7380)|
| 2:03:15| But that's the developer's, I mean, that's his layout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7395)|
| 2:03:20| I mean, is that what the staff is approving?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7400)|
| 2:03:22| The staff is recommending, yeah, a portion of that parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7402)|
| 2:03:27| You know, I think in the future, Lizzie, you all probably need to do a map that shows that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7407)|
| 2:03:31| and not rely on the developer's map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7411)|
| 2:03:38| If that's the case, then I will make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7418)|
| 2:03:42| Let me go back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7422)|
| 2:03:47| Okay, so I'll make a motion to approve the sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7427)|
| 2:03:51| to GC general commercial stream protection for a portion of parcel 083082| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7431)|
| 2:03:57| because it is a minor extension of an existing commercial node.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7437)|
| 2:04:01| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7441)|
| 2:04:03| All right, we've got a motion to approve the sector plan to general commercial and stream protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7443)|
| 2:04:09| The motion was made by Commissioner Phillips, seconded by Vice Chair Uten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7449)|
| 2:04:16| Seeing no other lights, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7456)|
| 2:04:19| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7459)|

| 2:04:34| per staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7474)|
| 2:04:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7477)|
| 2:04:40| We have a motion to approve the rezoning CA general business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7480)|

| 2:06:17| As noted from the introduction, we're requesting a rezoning from the ag| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7577)|
| 2:06:24| zoning designation to the CA general commercial zoning for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7584)|
| 2:06:29| It has been discussed on several of these other requests today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7589)|
| 2:06:34| The CA is just your general business zone that allows for general retail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7594)|
| 2:06:39| business and services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7599)|
| 2:06:42| The sector plan, the East County sector plan designates this property as GC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7602)|
| 2:06:49| general commercial, not only this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7609)|
| 2:06:51| but several other properties surrounding this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7611)|
| 2:06:53| I think it's about 11 different tracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7613)|
| 2:06:59| This property is located across Thorn Grove Pike from the Midway Business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7619)|

| 2:07:11| higher intensity type of business and commercial uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7631)|
| 2:07:15| Under the East County sector plan, it identifies CA as an appropriate zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7635)|
| 2:07:22| property that is designated GC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7642)|
| 2:07:25| It also identifies CB under certain conditions, which those aren't here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7645)|
| 2:07:31| but for the commercial based zoning it identifies CA as an appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7651)|
| 2:07:38| zoning designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7658)|
| 2:07:44| As noted in the staff report, the request satisfies the requirements of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7664)|
| 2:07:51| the Knox County ordinance for rezoning properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7671)|
| 2:07:54| We'd ask that you support staff recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7674)|
| 2:07:59| rezone the property from ag to CA subject to the one condition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7679)|
| 2:08:02| which we find that important too to offer some additional buffer and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7682)|

| 2:08:24| Luke Roberts, 831 Rosebud Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7704)|
| 2:08:27| That's number 105 up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7707)|
| 2:08:30| I also represent my aunt and uncle who are at 106.1 Paula Carroll and Wright| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7710)|
| 2:08:35| and my mother at 106 Karen Roberts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7715)|
| 2:08:40| We want to just point out that there's no zoning that touches this piece of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7720)|
| 2:08:46| property that is compatible with this request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7726)|
| 2:08:50| It's not compatible with the sector plan and how they laid out all of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7730)|
| 2:08:56| details around the Midway Business Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7736)|
| 2:09:00| As you can see in the photograph here, there is available property already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7740)|
| 2:09:06| zoned appropriately to take on whatever they're wanting to have less than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7746)|
| 2:09:13| half a mile from this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7753)|
| 2:09:15| And then also I'd like to point out that lot 27 of the Midway Business Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7755)|
| 2:09:21| was mentioned to be mixed-use development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7761)|
| 2:09:26| and it's on the corner that runs towards the ramp there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7766)|
| 2:09:30| It's on Midway and the ramp to I-40, that corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7770)|
| 2:09:36| It was documented to be used for mixed development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7776)|
| 2:09:41| So we ask that you guys see if they can find another place to put whatever they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7781)|
| 2:09:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7786)|
| 2:09:47| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7787)|
| 2:09:52| Here, Mr. Chairman, Kevin Murphy, 4508.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7792)|
| 2:09:56| So the East County sector plan was adopted in 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7796)|
| 2:10:00| That's 11 to 12 years ago now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7800)|
| 2:10:04| Midway Business Park was the sector plan amendments for that were 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7804)|
| 2:10:09| And after that was done, one of the things that happened is there was a huge amount of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7809)|
| 2:10:14| community input that happened for the East Knox Community Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7814)|
| 2:10:18| It's one of our small area plans, which was actually adopted by planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7818)|
| 2:10:23| and county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7823)|
| 2:10:25| That plan has a whole lot of concepts in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7825)|
| 2:10:29| suggestions for how to do development out in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7829)|
| 2:10:33| And, again, I actually don't know if that is fuzzy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7833)|
| 2:10:38| if that's a component of the general plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7838)|
| 2:10:40| but that has got a whole lot of information in it that the planning commission should be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7840)|
| 2:10:46| considering as they think about what's appropriate here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7846)|
| 2:10:49| In particular, there's a lot of discussion about this interchange,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7849)|
| 2:10:53| and it said that there should be, in that East Knox Community Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7853)|
| 2:10:57| it encouraged limits on future intense development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7857)|
| 2:11:00| So, first, you know, there's a sector plan, but there's also a small area plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7860)|
| 2:11:04| So that's even more fine detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7864)|
| 2:11:06| And that's kind of what we really wanted is we want communities to be helping to define| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7866)|
| 2:11:10| these detailed plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7870)|
| 2:11:12| So if you haven't read that, that is a key piece of information that I would encourage you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7872)|
| 2:11:17| to read before adopting a rezoning here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7877)|
| 2:11:20| If that is news to you, that's something that's really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7880)|
| 2:11:23| And the staff did a great job involving the community when they developed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7883)|
| 2:11:28| They did an ice cream social out at one place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7888)|
| 2:11:31| They did a thing out at Seven Islands State Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7891)|
| 2:11:34| So, you know, there's a huge community turnout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7894)|
| 2:11:37| So please be aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7897)|
| 2:11:40| With this particular request, first of all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7900)|
| 2:11:42| what really stands out to me is that this is an irregularly shaped parcel that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7902)|
| 2:11:45| touches residential not only on all sides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7905)|
| 2:11:48| but it actually surrounds that one residential property on three sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7908)|
| 2:11:52| So whatever happens here is going to have a substantial impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7912)|
| 2:11:57| The CA zone, as we discussed earlier, it doesn't have, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7917)|
| 2:12:02| it has no extra standards around lighting that spills over property lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7922)|
| 2:12:07| It has no extra standards on landscape escaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7927)|
| 2:12:12| And while there is a suggested condition, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7932)|
| 2:12:16| of a 12-foot landscape buffer next to a residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7936)|
| 2:12:19| that's from me to Mr. Snowden or a little bit less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7939)|
| 2:12:23| Yeah, and that's not a lot of landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7943)|
| 2:12:27| Really, you know, if anything was to go in there, CN might be a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7947)|
| 2:12:31| at least that has more substantial buffers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7951)|
| 2:12:33| and lower signage that might be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7953)|
| 2:12:37| But this is just so next to rural residential types of development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7957)|
| 2:12:41| that it seems like difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7961)|
| 2:12:44| But, again, I really encourage you to look at that East Knox Community Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7964)|
| 2:12:47| It's about 70 pages of what I think is some of the planning staff's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7967)|
| 2:12:51| and commission's best work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7971)|
| 2:12:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7972)|
| 2:12:54| Thank you, Mr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7974)|
| 2:12:56| I'm going to ask staff about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7976)|
| 2:12:59| I know we always want to make sure that our sector plans are consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7979)|
| 2:13:03| and we have our one-year plan and, you know, everything fits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7983)|
| 2:13:08| I don't hear so much about the small area plan being aligned with everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7988)|
| 2:13:15| Can you all share with us how we treat the small area plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=7995)|
| 2:13:20| Is it different than how we, is the requirement the same,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8000)|
| 2:13:24| that it aligns, like, with the sector plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8004)|
| 2:13:29| Usually when we update a sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8009)|
| 2:13:31| any small area plan or community plan that has been previously adopted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8011)|
| 2:13:38| usually gets incorporated into that sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8018)|
| 2:13:42| That plan, though, was adopted, the East Knox Community Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8022)|
| 2:13:48| So we do look at it and reference it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8028)|
| 2:13:50| but it did not have necessarily a proposed land use plan that went with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8030)|
| 2:13:59| much like the sector plans do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8039)|
| 2:14:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8042)|
| 2:14:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8043)|
| 2:14:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8047)|
| 2:14:08| Vice Chair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8048)|
| 2:14:09| I'd like to make a motion we approve the CA General Business Zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8049)|
| 2:14:11| because it's consistent with the sector plan subject to the one condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8051)|
| 2:14:14| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8054)|
| 2:14:16| We have a motion by Vice Chair Eaton to approve the General Business Zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8056)|
| 2:14:22| for staff recommendation subject to that one condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8062)|
| 2:14:25| Seconded by Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8065)|
| 2:14:29| Commissioner Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8069)|
| 2:14:31| I just want to appreciate Mr. Murphy's comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8071)|
| 2:14:35| You know, because the Midway Business Park really hasn't developed beyond the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8075)|
| 2:14:44| agreement that it would be a business park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8084)|
| 2:14:47| and the fact that there's so much agriculture and residential in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8087)|
| 2:14:50| I just really feel uncomfortable rezoning this to commercial at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8090)|
| 2:14:55| So I just want to let you know that that is my reason behind voting against this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8095)|
| 2:14:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8099)|
| 2:15:00| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8100)|
| 2:15:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8101)|
| 2:15:02| Seeing no other lights, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8102)|
| 2:15:04| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8104)|
| 2:15:05| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8105)|
| 2:15:06| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8106)|
| 2:15:07| We have two noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8107)|
| 2:15:10| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8110)|
| 2:15:11| Two noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8111)|
| 2:15:12| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8112)|
| 2:15:13| Commissioner Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8113)|
| 2:15:14| Are there any other noes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8114)|
| 2:15:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8116)|
| 2:15:17| We have two noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8117)|
| 2:15:18| Ms. Karen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8118)|
| 2:15:19| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8119)|
| 2:15:31| Next is Agenda Item Number 30, Applicant Rebecca Walls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8131)|
| 2:15:35| Location, northwest side of West Emory Road, east of Faith Haven Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8135)|
| 2:15:40| Contract information, 67.32 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8140)|
| 2:15:43| Present plan designation and zoning is agricultural, hillside protection, stream protection, agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8143)|
| 2:15:49| Proposed plan designation and zoning, rural residential, hillside protection, stream protection, and planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8149)|
| 2:15:55| Existing land use, agricultural, forestry, vacant land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8155)|
| 2:15:58| Density proposed up to three dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8158)|
| 2:16:02| This will require two motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8162)|
| 2:16:05| Staff recommendation is to approve the sector plan amendment to rural residential, hillside protection, and stream protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8165)|
| 2:16:12| because it is consistent with surrounding land use and trends in development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8172)|
| 2:16:17| The second recommendation is to approve the planned residential zone up to three dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8177)|
| 2:16:25| because it is consistent with the growth policy plan guidelines and surrounding development trends subject to one condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8185)|
| 2:16:33| And it looks like the applicant is present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8193)|

| 2:16:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8200)|
| 2:16:41| Do we have any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8201)|
| 2:16:45| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8205)|
| 2:16:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8207)|
| 2:16:48| You may proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8208)|
| 2:16:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8209)|

| 2:18:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8285)|
| 2:18:11| Moving on to agenda item 34.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8291)|
| 2:18:16| The applicant is Southland Group, Josh Sanderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8296)|
| 2:18:20| Subdivision, the meadows at Shannon Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8300)|
| 2:18:23| Location, west side of Murphy Road, southern terminus of Stonyhurst Lane, 13.48 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8303)|
| 2:18:32| Zoning is general residential and planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8312)|
| 2:18:35| Existing land use, agricultural, forestry, vacant land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8315)|
| 2:18:38| Proposed use, detached residential subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8318)|
| 2:18:41| Number of lots, 24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8321)|
| 2:18:44| This will require subdivision variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8324)|
| 2:18:47| Looks like two variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8327)|
| 2:18:49| This will require two motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8329)|
| 2:18:53| Approve the requested, the recommendation is to approve the requested variances based on the justification provided by the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8333)|
| 2:19:00| and recommendations of the Knox County Department of Engineering and Public Works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8340)|
| 2:19:05| Second recommendation is to approve the concept plan subject to seven conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8345)|
| 2:19:10| Applicant present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8350)|
| 2:19:14| Cody Smith, 4909 Ball Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8354)|
| 2:19:17| Thank you, Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8357)|
| 2:19:18| Do we have any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8358)|
| 2:19:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8360)|
| 2:19:21| Mr. Murphy, would you like to proceed or defer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8361)|
| 2:19:23| Mr. Murphy can go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8363)|
| 2:19:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8364)|
| 2:19:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8367)|
| 2:19:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8368)|
| 2:19:36| Kevin Murphy, 4508 Murphy Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8376)|
| 2:19:40| So I've got one condition that I'd like you to add to approval of the concept plan in this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8380)|
| 2:19:46| and that's that the applicant must work with Knox County Engineering and Public Works to install pedestrian crosswalks on Murphy Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8386)|
| 2:19:53| The reason for this request is that the applicant, the homes in here are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8393)|
| 2:20:00| they have access to the facilities at Shannon Valley Farms, which is located on the other side of Murphy Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8400)|
| 2:20:07| Knox County Engineering and Public Works is working on turn lane improvements at that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8407)|
| 2:20:13| Pedestrian crosswalks, when we had a meeting back in November or December, I don't think were in scope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8413)|
| 2:20:19| but we tried to bring that up as something that really needed to happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8419)|
| 2:20:23| because you are going to have people on one side of Murphy Road that will need to get over to access the clubhouse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8423)|
| 2:20:30| and the pool and area and everything else over at Shannon Valley Farms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8430)|
| 2:20:34| So that's a condition that I want to highlight and ask you to include in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8434)|
| 2:20:41| I also want to review a few things that were brought up when the prior, when the approval for the front part of this came up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8441)|
| 2:20:47| Some things that we'd asked that weren't looked at or weren't addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8447)|
| 2:20:53| First, I did get up here and I did ask for a landscaping screen to be required along Murphy Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8453)|
| 2:20:58| similar to what's over on Shannon Valley Farms on the east side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8458)|
| 2:21:02| That condition wasn't added to the approval, and I went out, took some pictures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8462)|
| 2:21:08| and included that in the comments that I submitted to you on Friday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8468)|
| 2:21:13| showing that there's really, now that you can see the build-out, there's a stark difference in how this looks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8473)|
| 2:21:19| It's the same developer on both sides of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8479)|
| 2:21:22| And I've heard comments from people in the community, and they've said, what is going on out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8482)|
| 2:21:27| That really brings up, I think this highlights an issue that we have with subdivision regulations and design guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8487)|
| 2:21:34| that deal when you have, when you develop a subdivision and you have interior streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8494)|
| 2:21:39| where those streets then have lots that have a backyard that abuts onto a major public road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8499)|
| 2:21:47| In this case, all the owners in the new Shannon Valley Farms, they've either had to buy a fence, build a fence, buy a fence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8507)|
| 2:21:55| or they just have a lot of cars looking right down from the road right into their back sliding glass doors that they've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8515)|
| 2:22:03| So I think their landscaping screen was asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8523)|
| 2:22:07| It would have been helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8527)|
| 2:22:09| And I wanted to highlight the product, what has been built, and stress the need for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8529)|
| 2:22:16| The other one that I had highlighted before in March 2021 was comments around soil conservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8536)|
| 2:22:24| In our general plan, in Section 6, it talks about respecting and nurturing our natural areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8544)|
| 2:22:30| and says prime agricultural land should be protected for continued use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8550)|
| 2:22:34| There's a soil conservation map that I'd included two years ago and including in today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8554)|
| 2:22:38| that shows that there is a lot of prime farmland as well as locally important soil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8558)|
| 2:22:43| All that has now been developed, and what's in front of you today includes a proposal for developing more of that locally important soil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8563)|
| 2:22:52| So I want to highlight those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8572)|
| 2:22:54| Those are impacts that the development proposals have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8574)|
| 2:22:59| And finally, you hear from me a lot about subdivision connectivity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8579)|
| 2:23:05| and this is one where the decisions that you make today have a profound impact for what happens in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8585)|
| 2:23:14| And there's the Brookvale Estate subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8594)|
| 2:23:18| It was rezoned and approved back in 1988 or 89, so we're going back in time caps a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8598)|
| 2:23:26| Summer Rose was approved in 96, built out by the same applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8606)|
| 2:23:29| and they didn't provide stub outs for potential connectivity to this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8609)|
| 2:23:34| Well, here we are. We're developing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8614)|
| 2:23:36| It's 20, 25 years later, and I included a map that shows that if you take a person in one of these houses that's just been built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8616)|
| 2:23:43| or that's in front of you for approval today, and they want to go visit their neighbor on the backyard in Brookvale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8623)|
| 2:23:49| well, that is a 1.6-mile walk that would take about 33 minutes to go from their backyard to backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8629)|
| 2:23:56| That's why subdivision connectivity is such an important thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8636)|
| 2:24:00| That's why we ask for it, and that's why you think, well, I don't own it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8640)|
| 2:24:04| And when somebody says, well, I don't control that property today, we don't know what's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8644)|
| 2:24:09| It's going to be really expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8649)|
| 2:24:10| But those decisions have impacts years and decades down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8650)|
| 2:24:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8654)|
| 2:24:15| Thank you. Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8655)|
| 2:24:20| Cody Smith, 4909 Ball Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8660)|
| 2:24:23| As far as the crosswalk goes connecting to Shannon Valley, I would probably defer to Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8663)|
| 2:24:31| That is a county improvement project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8671)|
| 2:24:34| We have contributed financially to that based on our percentage of the new developments addition to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8674)|
| 2:24:43| and we would be willing to work with the county to help with the crosswalk if that's something they deem necessary and want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8683)|
| 2:24:53| Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8693)|
| 2:24:57| This one's a tough one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8697)|
| 2:24:59| I mean, Murphy Road is a road that carries a lot of traffic and probably travels at pretty high speeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8699)|
| 2:25:09| I don't know if I would, I don't think I could recommend a pedestrian crossing without some significant improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8709)|
| 2:25:19| And, you know, to Mr. Smith's point, we are partnering with them to do some turn lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8719)|
| 2:25:27| Ideally it would be a situation where you'd want a pedestrian refuge island or something out there to kind of assist the pedestrian,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8727)|
| 2:25:34| but we really don't have the opportunity to do that at this particular location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8734)|
| 2:25:38| So it would be very tough to get a good, safe pedestrian crossing in at this location, just to be candid with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8738)|
| 2:25:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8747)|
| 2:25:51| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8751)|
| 2:25:56| So in all transparency, I live in Summer Rose, just right there next to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8756)|
| 2:26:02| I can tell you as a dad, there is no way that I would let my kids who are 16 and 13 cross from one side to the other because Murphy Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8762)|
| 2:26:10| while in the morning it's great, it's a parking lot because of the Montessori school there, but in the afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8770)|
| 2:26:18| I can remember going to high school at Gibbs when it was much more narrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8778)|
| 2:26:22| It is much wider now and people go at faster speeds than what are posted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8782)|
| 2:26:28| So again, to Jim's point, I would say without some signalization to alert drivers to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8788)|
| 2:26:35| it would be extremely dangerous for it just to be a straight pedestrian crossway just because of how wide it is now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8795)|
| 2:26:43| and the traffic volume that it does carry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8803)|
| 2:26:46| Same reason why I wouldn't want to have anybody crossing Tazewell Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8806)|
| 2:26:51| So I agree, though, however, with Mr. Murphy's point, and I think it's valid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8811)|
| 2:26:57| which is I think we need to be careful going forward that we make sure that we look at some stub out connectivities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8817)|
| 2:27:02| because, you know, there's some great walking trails in Summer Rose subdivision that would have been nice to have incorporated in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8822)|
| 2:27:09| that would have made it, you know, connected the neighborhoods a little bit better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8829)|
| 2:27:12| So those are just some of the comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8832)|
| 2:27:15| But without, you know, Jim sitting here saying, yes, we're going to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8835)|
| 2:27:20| I wouldn't want to add a condition or anything about pedestrian crossway just because I think we would end up seeing things on the news| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8840)|
| 2:27:28| that we don't want to see with accidents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8848)|
| 2:27:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8852)|
| 2:27:34| Mr. Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8854)|
| 2:27:35| Thank you, Chairman Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8855)|
| 2:27:38| Jim, are there any sidewalks in this area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8858)|
| 2:27:42| Unfortunately, there's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8862)|
| 2:27:44| The county built this road in probably late 1990s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8864)|
| 2:27:50| You know, if we were building this road today, we would obviously be installing sidewalks at these locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8870)|
| 2:27:55| But at that period of time, for whatever reason, we chose not to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8875)|
| 2:27:59| So, no, there's really no sidewalks anywhere in this vicinity along Murphy Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8879)|
| 2:28:05| So the idea of putting a crosswalk in I think lends itself more to potential liability if you have crosswalk and no sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8885)|
| 2:28:15| It would be, you know, to Commissioner Smith's point, I mean, we would want to see activated flashers and, you know, probably a refuge island.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8895)|
| 2:28:24| And there's not really a good place to put that refuge island unless you go, you know, probably upstream of this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8904)|
| 2:28:32| You're having to, to your point, having to build sidewalks on both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8912)|
| 2:28:35| It's just a tough spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8915)|
| 2:28:40| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8920)|
| 2:28:47| I have the exact opposite experience of Commissioner Smith because for the last, I think, gazillion years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8927)|
| 2:28:54| I've been in the position of needing to cross that road multiple times a year with children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8934)|
| 2:29:01| And what I would have given to have a crosswalk there with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8941)|
| 2:29:06| And I've watched mothers caring their little kids to get across that road with the only help being someone who happens to stop their car and pause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8946)|
| 2:29:16| So I hear what Jim is saying about the difficulty there in providing some kind of safe passage for people and that there's the chance for liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8956)|
| 2:29:30| But I think that's the way you actually start slowing things down is by actually having some signalization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8970)|
| 2:29:36| And we have added new developments in the last two years along the Murphy Road all the way to the intersection with Haswell Pike in very large number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8976)|
| 2:29:50| I would really be curious to know how many new households we've added in the last two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8990)|
| 2:29:57| I don't know if anyone can give me a rough estimate, but it's a lot of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=8997)|
| 2:30:04| So whether there was some kind of crossway or signalization anywhere along there, I just feel like it's time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9004)|
| 2:30:11| We didn't get sidewalks before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9011)|
| 2:30:14| And, you know, we've only added to the residential population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9014)|
| 2:30:18| So something really should be done to account for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9018)|
| 2:30:23| I particularly appreciated the pictures that Mr. Murphy posted to this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9023)|
| 2:30:28| I hope that every commissioner looked at those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9028)|
| 2:30:31| If you didn't, do so now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9031)|
| 2:30:34| They're there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9034)|
| 2:30:35| But it is a dramatic difference between one side of the street and the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9035)|
| 2:30:42| One side has vegetative screening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9042)|
| 2:30:46| One side looks like you're looking at something you're not supposed to be seeing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9046)|
| 2:30:53| And that's because it's kind of like a sound set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9053)|
| 2:30:58| Like there's only one way to view that residence appropriately, and it's from the front of their house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9058)|
| 2:31:05| If you see it from any other angle, you're kind of looking at the sound set and the back side of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9065)|
| 2:31:11| And it is very visible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9071)|
| 2:31:13| When you're driving along there, it doesn't matter if you're a resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9073)|
| 2:31:16| Just if you're driving along, there's a big difference between these two sides of the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9076)|
| 2:31:20| So I do think that this plan should require a vegetative border that is akin to the one that is right across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9080)|
| 2:31:31| I wish that I had some great suggestion for how to fix the road issue there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9091)|
| 2:31:40| And it doesn't sound like having a crosswalk requirement is something that would be tenable from what you're saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9100)|
| 2:31:49| but some kind of consideration for how these two properties connect to one another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9109)|
| 2:31:55| if they have agreements to share resources, and then some kind of plan for connectivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9115)|
| 2:32:01| I'm not the best person to point out where the ideal stub out should be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9121)|
| 2:32:05| but some kind of connectivity between these two or three subdivisions now would be, I think, an important thing to do now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9125)|
| 2:32:15| Case in point, there is a case that was heard on consent today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9135)|
| 2:32:22| and the reason I didn't raise my hand about it is because there really couldn't be a stub out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9142)|
| 2:32:27| because the properties all around it had never provided one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9147)|
| 2:32:30| So it's kind of this catch-22 that you get into if we don't ever take a little bit of a pause and figure out how to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9150)|
| 2:32:36| So I would encourage us to really think about that today as we're voting on this and putting together ideas to improve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9156)|
| 2:32:46| Thank you. Commissioner Schell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9166)|
| 2:32:50| So there's no sidewalks within this concept plan, correct, that I can tell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9170)|
| 2:32:56| No, I believe we do have sidewalks on one side of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9176)|
| 2:33:03| That could be inaccurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9183)|
| 2:33:07| Okay, I'm sorry, there are no sidewalks, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9187)|
| 2:33:09| Okay, and so this is connecting to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9189)|
| 2:33:14| Not connecting, or it's part of the same HOA or amenities across the street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9194)|
| 2:33:21| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9201)|
| 2:33:23| So that subdivision does have sidewalks, but those were put in and are managed by the HOA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9203)|
| 2:33:34| No, by the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9214)|
| 2:33:36| I don't believe they're managed by the HOA. Those are county sidewalks, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9216)|
| 2:33:40| All throughout that entire subdivision, there's a lot of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9220)|
| 2:33:45| So if you don't put sidewalks in, I mean, I guess we're not looking at the right concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9225)|
| 2:33:51| It's already approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9231)|
| 2:33:52| That Stargate Drive, is there a plan to have a â€“ I mean, we can't put a potential connection between the two crossing the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9232)|
| 2:34:01| if there's no sidewalk to cross to, necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9241)|
| 2:34:06| So I don't know what that really accomplishes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9246)|
| 2:34:09| because we should have required sidewalks on the other section that this is connecting to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9249)|
| 2:34:14| Luckily, we did require stub out on that, and it's not a new, you know, connection onto Murphy Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9254)|
| 2:34:27| It's unfortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9267)|
| 2:34:29| I mean, we can't even really set it up to say, hey, county, look at this in five years to make it safe to cross,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9269)|
| 2:34:35| because we don't have sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9275)|
| 2:34:37| So, I mean, we need to start requiring them, even if it's on the HOA to manage them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9277)|
| 2:34:44| and not on the county, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9284)|
| 2:34:46| It's an amenity for a PR zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9286)|
| 2:34:51| And just to â€“ I don't want to say something that's not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9291)|
| 2:34:56| Typically â€“ and I handle the land development portion for our business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9296)|
| 2:35:02| We actually leave the sidewalks to the home builder portion of our business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9302)|
| 2:35:07| Even when it's not required by the county, we typically do put sidewalks at least on one side of every road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9307)|
| 2:35:13| I can't guarantee that they are in here, but I do think they are, but I can't speak to that for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9313)|
| 2:35:20| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9320)|
| 2:35:22| So, again, pardon me if a lot of you all know this, you know, but this is an area that I grew up in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9322)|
| 2:35:30| and I can remember going to high school when Murphy Road was â€“| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9330)|
| 2:35:35| you would pass each other and hope that your mirrors didn't meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9335)|
| 2:35:38| It was that narrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9338)|
| 2:35:40| Kevin, you'll remember this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9340)|
| 2:35:41| Before Shannon Valley Farm, before Summer Rose, all of that was farmland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9341)|
| 2:35:45| and there was this pathway underneath the road for the cattle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9345)|
| 2:35:49| because they didn't even want cattle going across Murphy Road because it was too dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9349)|
| 2:35:53| They would let the cattle go underneath Murphy Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9353)|
| 2:35:55| So, this area has a long history of some dangerous driving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9355)|
| 2:36:02| Now, the county did come in and widen it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9362)|
| 2:36:04| That entire area is growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9364)|
| 2:36:06| As you said, we've got a ton of new developments out in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9366)|
| 2:36:10| It's going to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9370)|
| 2:36:11| You look long range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9371)|
| 2:36:13| People are moving into that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9373)|
| 2:36:14| So, what I would say is while we can't add the conditions now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9374)|
| 2:36:18| I would want to encourage the county engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9378)|
