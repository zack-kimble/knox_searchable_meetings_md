| 0:01:44| I thought somebody said...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=104)|
| 0:01:47| I thought she...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=107)|
| 0:01:48| I thought there was a first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=108)|
| 0:01:50| I just did the second, so somebody will have to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=110)|
| 0:01:53| He made it first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=113)|
| 0:01:55| Oh, Schoonmaker did?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=115)|
| 0:01:56| Well...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=116)|

| 0:01:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=119)|
| 0:02:00| I'm going to turn this over to the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=120)|
| 0:02:02| He's going to explain the procedures for today's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=122)|
| 0:02:06| Go ahead, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=126)|
| 0:02:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=128)|
| 0:02:09| If you're here today to testify before this, the Knox County Beer Committee, will you please stand and raise your right hand at this time and be sworn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=129)|
| 0:02:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=145)|
| 0:02:30| Do you solemnly swear and affirm the testimony you shall give in these matters shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=150)|
| 0:02:37| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=157)|
| 0:02:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=158)|
| 0:02:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=159)|
| 0:02:40| Be seated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=160)|
| 0:02:41| For the non-applicant issues, those who are brought here before this committee with suspension or revocation allegations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=161)|
| 0:02:53| what will happen in this particular phase is our officer will have an officer come to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=173)|
| 0:03:01| Your name will be called, and the officer will come to the podium and testify toward the allegations that have been alleged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=181)|
| 0:03:10| Then you will have an opportunity to hear what the officer says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=190)|
| 0:03:14| You will have an opportunity to either affirm or deny those allegations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=194)|
| 0:03:20| After that, you will have an opportunity to give testimony before this body in any shape, form, or manner you need to to present your side of the case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=200)|
| 0:03:30| and then the committee will deliberate the facts as presented and make a judgment regarding your situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=210)|
| 0:03:41| So the chairman will be calling each one of these cases individually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=221)|
| 0:03:46| and then I will be asking the sheriff's department to come and testify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=226)|
| 0:03:50| Then we'll be asking you to follow suit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=230)|
| 0:03:54| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=234)|
| 0:03:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=236)|
| 0:03:57| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=237)|
| 0:03:58| Madam Clerk, the first one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=238)|
| 0:04:00| Consideration of suspension, revocation of the beer permit for the following establishments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=240)|
| 0:04:05| Up in Smoke, 930 East Emory Road, Chris D. Selvidge, owner, third offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=245)|
| 0:04:10| First offense, April 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=250)|
| 0:04:12| Second offense, April 2017, District 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=252)|
| 0:04:19| I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=259)|
| 0:04:20| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=260)|
| 0:04:25| Would you like to present testimony in regard to the allegations related to this event?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=265)|
| 0:04:34| On March 14, 2018, conducted an underage beer sting at Up in Smoke, 930 East Emory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=274)|
| 0:04:41| Purchased a 25-ounce can, Bud Light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=281)|
| 0:04:49| If you'd like to present your name and address, please, for the record at the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=289)|
| 0:04:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=293)|
| 0:04:54| My name is Brent Nolan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=294)|
| 0:04:55| I'm an attorney representing Up in Smoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=295)|
| 0:04:57| My address is 347 Hickory Stone Lane in Powell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=297)|
| 0:05:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=302)|
| 0:05:03| Mr. Nolan, you've heard the testimony that was given before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=303)|
| 0:05:06| Do you affirm or deny the allegations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=306)|
| 0:05:09| We affirm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=309)|
| 0:05:10| We affirm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=310)|
| 0:05:11| Do you have anything that you'd like to state on behalf of your client before this board at this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=311)|
| 0:05:15| I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=315)|
| 0:05:17| I think Thursday of last week we had the opportunity to submit a response that outlined some of the information that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=317)|
| 0:05:26| What we have is a situation that my client has been in business about 20 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=326)|
| 0:05:33| and up until the last two years basically had no real issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=333)|
| 0:05:39| What has occurred was his wife was overseeing day-to-day operations at the store| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=339)|
| 0:05:45| and has some medical issues that has required her to be hospitalized at times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=345)|
| 0:05:50| and be away from the store at certain times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=350)|
| 0:05:53| So what we did after the last citation, the second citation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=353)|
| 0:05:59| he implemented a program, spent over $6,000 on a software program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=359)|
| 0:06:04| that had required the license to actually be scanned by the clerk into this software,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=364)|
| 0:06:11| and then it would either approve or decline the sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=371)|
| 0:06:15| And what happened in this situation was the clerk actually scanned the license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=375)|
| 0:06:20| and the red flags came up on the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=380)|
| 0:06:23| And rather than decline the sale, the clerk manually overrode the system and proceeded forward with the sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=383)|
| 0:06:30| My client then immediately terminates this employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=390)|
| 0:06:35| and begins contacting Kim Pouncey over at Top Shelf| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=395)|
| 0:06:40| and trying to figure out what can we do to even improve our system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=400)|
| 0:06:46| that we thought was fail-safe at that point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=406)|
| 0:06:49| And so Ms. Pouncey came in and did a thorough review of the policies and procedures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=409)|
| 0:06:55| that we have in place and actually submitted that to us last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=415)|
| 0:07:01| and we put that in a form of corrective action plan and attached it to our submittal last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=421)|
| 0:07:06| And these actions include having each clerk go forward and sign a date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=426)|
| 0:07:14| recognizing what the date is at the beginning of each shift,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=434)|
| 0:07:18| and also going forward with training of every employee not annually but twice annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=438)|
| 0:07:25| So that way we're trying to go above and beyond to make sure that this does not occur, that it is zero tolerance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=445)|
| 0:07:33| We understand that it's not acceptable, and we thought we put into play a system that was fail-safe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=453)|
| 0:07:39| and any time that you introduce a human element into the process, it's clear that mistakes can occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=459)|
| 0:07:47| And so he took immediate action in making sure that it was taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=467)|
| 0:07:56| We got a letter of recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=476)|
| 0:07:58| I think Ms. Pouncey indicated in the letter that he's been very responsive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=478)|
| 0:08:05| This is not a situation where we have a business that's just ignoring the law or flaunting the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=485)|
| 0:08:15| This is a situation that, because of some medical conditions, that we've now had to rely on employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=495)|
| 0:08:23| and we're trying to put in the systems to make sure that this doesn't occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=503)|
| 0:08:27| And we're here today telling you that we've tried to do things that we can to make sure this does not occur in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=507)|
| 0:08:35| and any suggestions that anybody would make, whether it be law enforcement or anybody else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=515)|
| 0:08:43| we'd be happy to implement it, but we're doing the, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=523)|
| 0:08:47| we think we have a good plan going forward to ensure that this does not occur again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=527)|
| 0:08:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=532)|
| 0:08:53| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=533)|
| 0:08:56| Okay, is there any discussion amongst the commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=536)|
| 0:08:59| Commissioner Boesler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=539)|
| 0:09:01| I've got a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=541)|
| 0:09:02| Here's a gentleman that has tried to implement a program that, you know, that they have to scan the license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=542)|
| 0:09:11| and then you have an individual that is employed that knowingly violates that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=551)|
| 0:09:17| And how many were, let me ask you this, Brent, how many were in the store at the time that this happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=557)|
| 0:09:24| How many customers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=564)|
| 0:09:25| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=565)|
| 0:09:27| Employees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=567)|
| 0:09:28| Employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=568)|
| 0:09:29| Were there two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=569)|
| 0:09:30| There would be two employees on that shift, and this was a relatively new employee for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=570)|
| 0:09:38| Okay, the relatively new employee was the one that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=578)|
| 0:09:42| That did the selling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=582)|
| 0:09:45| Who else was in the store?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=585)|
| 0:09:46| It would have been a shift manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=586)|
| 0:09:50| And it's my understanding they didn't realize what had transpired until after it occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=590)|
| 0:09:59| This is the third time in three years, one every year, and you try to do the best you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=599)|
| 0:10:07| What are our options here for this gentleman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=607)|
| 0:10:11| Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=611)|
| 0:10:15| Well, under the normal traditional, you can fine them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=615)|
| 0:10:23| You can suspend their license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=623)|
| 0:10:26| You can revoke their license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=626)|
| 0:10:30| And the, I think the maximum fine in this case normally is $1,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=630)|
| 0:10:39| But the one they've been using, what is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=639)|
| 0:10:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=645)|
| 0:10:46| Last year you did 30-day suspension of $2,000 fine, so you weren't following the, this was an extra case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=646)|
| 0:10:56| What you can do up to $2,500, I think, is the maximum fine you can impose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=656)|
| 0:11:01| You can suspend the license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=661)|
| 0:11:02| You can terminate the license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=662)|
| 0:11:04| You can do a combination of whatever you want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=664)|
| 0:11:08| It's a policy decision for this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=668)|
| 0:11:13| Sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=673)|
| 0:11:16| You said it was a relatively new employee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=676)|
| 0:11:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=678)|
| 0:11:19| Had that employee been through the serving training program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=679)|
| 0:11:22| They had been scheduled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=682)|
| 0:11:23| I think she had only been in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=683)|
| 0:11:25| She had been through it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=685)|
| 0:11:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=686)|
| 0:11:27| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=687)|
| 0:11:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=688)|
| 0:11:32| Mr. Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=692)|
| 0:11:36| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=696)|
| 0:11:37| Chief May, have you been there to their location other times other than last April and the April before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=697)|
| 0:11:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=706)|
| 0:11:47| How many times have they, do you recall how many times they've passed or do you have any record of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=707)|
| 0:11:53| Can he use his microphone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=713)|
| 0:11:56| Yeah, I can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=716)|
| 0:12:00| They've passed several times in the three-year period that we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=720)|
| 0:12:06| I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=726)|
| 0:12:07| The thing that really stands out most to me, if it's April and this is going into prom season,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=727)|
| 0:12:12| and this is when everybody has to be extremely careful, not that you shouldn't be extremely careful all the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=732)|
| 0:12:17| but you know what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=737)|
| 0:12:18| That's when you might have people trying to, or young people trying to get around more often than not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=738)|
| 0:12:27| That is what really sticks out in my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=747)|
| 0:12:30| But you have passed several times other than these three in the last three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=750)|
| 0:12:35| So that's, I'm glad to hear that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=755)|
| 0:12:40| Commissioner Busser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=760)|
| 0:12:42| I'm sorry, hold on, Charles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=762)|
| 0:12:44| Robertsville will let Evelyn go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=764)|
| 0:12:46| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=766)|
| 0:12:47| I saw under your underage beer compliance, since this was a relatively new employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=767)|
| 0:12:53| that no one can sell beer 15 days after their employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=773)|
| 0:12:59| I guess this person was 15, was still in their probationary period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=779)|
| 0:13:03| Is that part of what the issue was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=783)|
| 0:13:06| Yes, and what we have is under the beer compliance that you have indicated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=786)|
| 0:13:12| that we submitted as under, this was the new policy that we are implementing that we got from Miss Pouncey last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=792)|
| 0:13:20| and that's one of the things that she suggested that we do, and we've begun implementing that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=800)|
| 0:13:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=806)|
| 0:13:28| Commissioner Busser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=808)|
| 0:13:29| So the last time that we were in here, we did what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=809)|
| 0:13:32| What was the fine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=812)|
| 0:13:35| A $2,000 fine and a 30-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=815)|
| 0:13:42| Somebody that's trying that hard to do something, I don't want to completely suspend their license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=822)|
| 0:13:48| but I make a motion that we do $2,500 and a 30-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=828)|
| 0:13:57| Let me repeat the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=837)|
| 0:13:59| It's a $2,500 fine and a 30-day suspension?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=839)|
| 0:14:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=844)|
| 0:14:05| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=845)|
| 0:14:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=846)|
| 0:14:08| Sir, as someone whose family ran a business, a convenience store business, for 28 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=848)|
| 0:14:14| I know how hard it is to find employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=854)|
| 0:14:17| I often sit up here and tell these people that we have people's livelihood, their businesses are on the line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=857)|
| 0:14:25| and they're having to trust that their employees will do the right thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=865)|
| 0:14:29| and quite often the employee gets cited too, but it's basically a $50 fine that gets waived when they go to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=869)|
| 0:14:37| I've often said we need more help from the state to put some teeth into making everybody accountable for their actions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=877)|
| 0:14:43| because it's totally impossible to always watch over your employees completely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=883)|
| 0:14:49| Okay, with that, we have a motion and a second on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=889)|
| 0:14:53| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=893)|
| 0:14:54| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=894)|
| 0:14:56| Opposed say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=896)|
| 0:14:57| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=897)|
| 0:15:01| Commissioner, could I, just for a point of clarification so I can explain to my client,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=901)|
| 0:15:05| with a 30-day suspension maybe I should talk to the officer about implementing the cutoff time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=905)|
| 0:15:12| I don't know who to speak to so I can advise my client as to the date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=912)|
| 0:15:17| Is it just when we walk out the door or when they come in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=917)|
| 0:15:20| The penalty is effective now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=920)|
| 0:15:23| You'll get with Chief May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=923)|
| 0:15:25| I keep forgetting if he got promoted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=925)|
| 0:15:27| Chief May and they will work with you and your beer supplier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=927)|
| 0:15:31| and he will deal with you on the paperwork as far as your permit goes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=931)|
| 0:15:38| and the reinstatement will be back through the chief and the clerk's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=938)|
| 0:15:44| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=944)|
| 0:15:50| Also, you have seven days to pay the fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=950)|
| 0:15:53| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=953)|
| 0:15:56| Pilot number 121-6900 Maynardville Pike, Pilot Corporation, owner of First Defense, District 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=956)|
| 0:16:21| Chief May, if you would like to testify and bring the allegations before this body for the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=981)|
| 0:16:28| this is the Maynardville Pike store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=988)|
| 0:16:33| On March 15, 2018, conducted underage beer sting, Pilot 121-6900 Maynardville Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=993)|
| 0:16:41| bought Bud Light Coconut Rita.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1001)|
| 0:16:45| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1005)|
| 0:16:48| Mr. Spokesman for Pilot, state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1008)|
| 0:16:51| Keith Maynard, 115 Seneca Lane in Clinton, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1011)|
| 0:16:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1017)|
| 0:16:58| Mr. Maynard, you have heard the allegations before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1018)|
| 0:17:01| Do you affirm or deny these allegations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1021)|
| 0:17:03| Affirm, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1023)|
| 0:17:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1024)|
| 0:17:05| This is your opportunity to tell this committee anything you would like for them to hear on your behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1025)|
| 0:17:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1029)|
| 0:17:10| And so I'll turn the floor over to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1030)|
| 0:17:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1031)|
| 0:17:12| So I am the compliance and training officer for Pilot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1032)|
| 0:17:16| as far as the food marks go in the Knoxville area and the surrounding counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1036)|
| 0:17:21| And the thing, I just wanted to let you know the things that we do as a company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1041)|
| 0:17:25| to try to prevent these things from happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1045)|
| 0:17:28| We do a mandatory task class, which you're probably all aware of, at KPD,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1048)|
| 0:17:33| and all of our Knox County and Knox City store managers go every year and get recertified on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1053)|
| 0:17:42| And we're up to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1062)|
| 0:17:43| As of today, we're up to date on every one of our stores for that training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1063)|
| 0:17:48| which is the techniques of alcohol servers knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1068)|
| 0:17:52| As far as employees go, we have an e-training that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1072)|
| 0:17:56| So when an employee is hired, before they run the register for the first time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1076)|
| 0:18:00| they have to go through this e-learning, which tells them the right way to sell alcohol,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1080)|
| 0:18:05| which is carding and physically looking at the card in your hand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1085)|
| 0:18:09| and doing the right thing as far as that goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1089)|
| 0:18:12| Other things that we do, and that, again, is before they run their first shift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1092)|
| 0:18:16| So they're not out there for two or three days, and then we train them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1096)|
| 0:18:19| Before they get on the register, we want them to know exactly what the right thing to do is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1099)|
| 0:18:25| We also have a welcome letter that's sent out to every new employee electronically to the store from our vice president| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1105)|
| 0:18:33| that welcomes them to our company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1113)|
| 0:18:35| And in that letter, he'll state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1115)|
| 0:18:38| I look forward to seeing your successful any kind of beer sting or any kind of customer service things come my way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1118)|
| 0:18:45| which is basically another motivational tactic to try to get them to do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1125)|
| 0:18:51| We do a TIPS class, which is the Training for Intervention procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1131)|
| 0:18:56| It's a statewide thing, and the travel center's on our side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1136)|
| 0:18:59| I actually do that as well, and we do that quarterly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1139)|
| 0:19:02| And when we do that, we'll bring in any new employee for additional training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1142)|
| 0:19:06| and we'll invite Chief May to come along, and he'll speak to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1146)|
| 0:19:10| Anytime we do these classes, I get with Chief May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1150)|
| 0:19:12| He'll come in and spend 30 minutes with them, explain some of the things that he's witnessed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1152)|
| 0:19:16| and then he'll field any questions that they might have at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1156)|
| 0:19:21| Another thing that we do is we send a monthly reminder to the store,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1161)|
| 0:19:24| and it's a physical piece of paper, and it has our policy and procedures intact on there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1164)|
| 0:19:30| and every employee has to sign that and send it back in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1170)|
| 0:19:33| and we keep those on file, which we have the records for all those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1173)|
| 0:19:37| There's also a shiftly reminder, so when an employee comes into work and they clock in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1177)|
| 0:19:42| they go straight to the shiftly reminder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1182)|
| 0:19:44| and they have to physically write today's legal date to sell beer and sign it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1184)|
| 0:19:48| and we have that as well, and that's handwritten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1188)|
| 0:19:54| Other things that we do is our above store team, we've got a staff of 10 in our office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1194)|
| 0:19:58| and anytime we're in the stores and we physically are watching any kind of beer sale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1198)|
| 0:20:02| we consider that a beer staying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1202)|
| 0:20:04| We'll follow up with them to make sure they're doing the right things as we're in the store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1204)|
| 0:20:07| So anytime there's a beer sale while we're in the stores, we consider that a beer staying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1207)|
| 0:20:13| with us being the people that's watching to make sure we're doing the right thing as far as our training goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1213)|
| 0:20:20| And, again, any employee that's cited for doing this and is guilty is in immediate termination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1220)|
| 0:20:26| from Pilot Corporation, Pilot Food Marts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1226)|
| 0:20:31| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1231)|
| 0:20:34| Any discussion among the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1234)|
| 0:20:39| Mr. Bressler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1239)|
| 0:20:42| I was going to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1242)|
| 0:20:44| The first fine is what, is that $1,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1244)|
| 0:20:48| I'm going to make a motion that we do a fine of $1,000 or, what is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1248)|
| 0:20:55| 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1255)|
| 0:20:56| 30-day suspension of the beer sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1256)|
| 0:21:04| Do I have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1264)|
| 0:21:07| Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1267)|
| 0:21:08| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1268)|
| 0:21:10| How long had the employee been with Pilot Oil Corporation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1270)|
| 0:21:16| Three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1276)|
| 0:21:17| Three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1277)|
| 0:21:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1280)|
| 0:21:21| My name is Mike Kitts with Pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1281)|
| 0:21:24| I'd actually just given her a, she had passed a tobacco sting back in January| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1284)|
| 0:21:29| and I'd just given her a recommendation on a tobacco sting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1289)|
| 0:21:33| And I was actually present during this failure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1293)|
| 0:21:39| And it's very unfortunate with the tools we have that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1299)|
| 0:21:43| But I lost a three-year good employee that did make a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1303)|
| 0:21:51| But we went back and retrained the people that are working there now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1311)|
| 0:21:57| and got all the tools in place for this not to happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1317)|
| 0:22:05| Would you state your name and address for the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1325)|
| 0:22:07| Mike Kitts, 8108 Bells Campground Road in Powell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1327)|
| 0:22:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1331)|
| 0:22:13| So do you think your new procedures will prevent this from happening again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1333)|
| 0:22:18| And what I'm getting at is I've been on this committee since 2015,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1338)|
| 0:22:23| and I think this is the first time Pilot's been here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1343)|
| 0:22:25| but yet we've got three of them here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1345)|
| 0:22:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1351)|
| 0:22:32| Two of which belong to me and one of them is one of the travel center stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1352)|
| 0:22:37| But these are not new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1357)|
| 0:22:38| These are ongoing training that we've been doing for some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1358)|
| 0:22:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1362)|
| 0:22:49| Kitts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1369)|
| 0:22:50| Kitts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1370)|
| 0:22:51| Mr. Kitts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1371)|
| 0:22:52| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1372)|
| 0:22:53| Sir, what was the failure in the process when this transaction took place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1373)|
| 0:22:57| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1377)|
| 0:22:58| A young lady come to the checkout with a beer, and Kayla took the ID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1378)|
| 0:23:05| the register prompts it to type in the right ID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1385)|
| 0:23:09| and she turned around to look at it and put in the wrong year of the date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1389)|
| 0:23:18| Now, year or not, it was a failure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1398)|
| 0:23:22| And I was actually there on site when it happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1402)|
| 0:23:26| and talked to the officers and talked to her and terminated her ten minutes later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1406)|
| 0:23:33| And she, you know, everybody has an excuse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1413)|
| 0:23:36| but said the sun was in her eyes or whatever, but you've got to be –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1416)|
| 0:23:39| they go through training, they've got to put in the right date, and we know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1419)|
| 0:23:45| That's why we terminate anyone that fails or does anything that they shouldn't do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1425)|
| 0:23:51| That's – and I think she put in 1987 instead of 97.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1431)|
| 0:24:01| I think she's already went on to what – she took the tips class again and paid the fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1441)|
| 0:24:08| but will not come back and work for us, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1448)|
| 0:24:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1453)|
| 0:24:14| We have a motion and a second before us to either fine $1,000 or a 30-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1454)|
| 0:24:24| Is there any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1464)|
| 0:24:27| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1467)|
| 0:24:29| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1469)|
| 0:24:30| Opposed say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1470)|
| 0:24:31| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1471)|
| 0:24:35| You have a choice of the $1,000 fine or 30-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1475)|
| 0:24:45| $1,000, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1485)|
| 0:24:46| Okay. You have seven days to pay the clerk's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1486)|
| 0:24:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1488)|
| 0:24:52| Mr. Kitts, I just want to say one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1492)|
| 0:24:55| You've been a very good company for the 7th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1495)|
| 0:25:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1501)|
| 0:25:02| I didn't have to do this, but that's just the rules of the game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1502)|
| 0:25:05| Yeah, the 30 years we've been out in the halls, that was the first thing I know of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1505)|
| 0:25:10| I've been with the company 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1510)|
| 0:25:13| It's very unfortunate that it happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1513)|
| 0:25:18| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1518)|
| 0:25:19| Pilot number 123-6804 Clinton Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1519)|
| 0:25:22| Pilot Corporation owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1522)|
| 0:25:24| First offense, District 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1524)|
| 0:25:29| Chief May, this is the Clinton Highway location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1529)|
| 0:25:38| On March 14, 2018, went to Pilot 6804 Clinton Highway, purchased 16-ounce Miller Lite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1538)|
| 0:25:52| You've heard the allegation stated before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1552)|
| 0:25:54| Do you affirm or deny?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1554)|
| 0:25:55| Affirm, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1555)|
| 0:25:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1556)|
| 0:25:57| This is your opportunity again to say anything you'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1557)|
| 0:26:00| It would be just the same as the original.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1560)|
| 0:26:03| Do you want me to go through that again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1563)|
| 0:26:06| You guys and gals have heard my training procedures, and we can go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1566)|
| 0:26:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1571)|
| 0:26:12| What was the situation when this transaction took place to cause a failure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1572)|
| 0:26:16| Sir, I'm Gary Strange, 126 Hickory Net Drive, Clinton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1576)|
| 0:26:19| I'm the region manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1579)|
| 0:26:20| I'm on year 36 with Pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1580)|
| 0:26:23| It's been probably 15 years since I've had a failure in one of my locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1583)|
| 0:26:27| I apologize for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1587)|
| 0:26:29| The cadet pulled out his ID, was getting ready to hand it to Chris Rose, the employee that was terminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1589)|
| 0:26:35| Chris opted to key in his own birth date on the register.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1595)|
| 0:26:38| He didn't look at the officer's ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1598)|
| 0:26:43| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1603)|
| 0:26:48| Again, I look down here, and there's three pilots in my district that had a failure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1608)|
| 0:26:56| You've been a good company out in the 7th District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1616)|
| 0:27:01| but there must be something out there that's causing this to happen, three in the same district in three locations out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1621)|
| 0:27:10| I'm going to make a motion that it's a $1,000 fine or a 30-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1630)|
| 0:27:15| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1635)|
| 0:27:18| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1638)|
| 0:27:20| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1640)|
| 0:27:21| How long had the employee been in service with Pilot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1641)|
| 0:27:24| Chris had been in service 10 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1644)|
| 0:27:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1647)|
| 0:27:28| Do they also know when they look at an ID that there is a red border around the license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1648)|
| 0:27:33| that tells you automatically that that individual is less than 21 years of age?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1653)|
| 0:27:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1658)|
| 0:27:39| Before even looking at a date of birth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1659)|
| 0:27:42| But he just...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1662)|
| 0:27:44| He did not look at the cadet's ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1664)|
| 0:27:46| As soon as the officer pulled out the ID, he started keying in a birth date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1666)|
| 0:27:50| He did not look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1670)|
| 0:27:52| So he probably did that more than once then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1672)|
| 0:27:54| That's what I'm guessing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1674)|
| 0:27:59| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1679)|
| 0:28:00| Yeah, just a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1680)|
| 0:28:01| Maybe I misunderstood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1681)|
| 0:28:03| Did you say that the clerk typed in their own birthday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1683)|
| 0:28:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1687)|
| 0:28:08| Is that what they're supposed to do once they look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1688)|
| 0:28:11| or they're supposed to type in the birthday of the person buying the beer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1691)|
| 0:28:14| They're supposed to type in that birth date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1694)|
| 0:28:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1697)|
| 0:28:20| That's what some employees do then is type in their own birthday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1700)|
| 0:28:23| This particular employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1703)|
| 0:28:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1705)|
| 0:28:26| I didn't know there was a standard operating...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1706)|
| 0:28:27| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1707)|
| 0:28:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1708)|
| 0:28:29| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1709)|
| 0:28:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1711)|
| 0:28:32| We have a motion and a second before us to issue either a $1,000 fine or a 30-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1712)|
| 0:28:40| Is there any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1720)|
| 0:28:43| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1723)|
| 0:28:44| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1724)|

| 0:30:08| we do have tons of training everybody goes through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1808)|
| 0:30:11| I actually have got everybody recertified since this did happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1811)|
| 0:30:15| The employee that was terminated for this was with us maybe three weeks, four weeks tops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1815)|
| 0:30:21| She hadn't had a tips class yet, so it was scheduled, but she didn't make it to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1821)|
| 0:30:27| She came in, or I was actually not in the store at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1827)|
| 0:30:31| I got a call, and the cadet came in, showed his ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1831)|
| 0:30:35| The young lady looked at it, did not key in the date of birth, just said age okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1835)|
| 0:30:40| When I did talk to her about it, she was talking about how it was lined up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1840)|
| 0:30:44| was lined up, but I did tell her there was still no tolerance for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1844)|
| 0:30:47| She had to key in the date of birth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1847)|
| 0:30:50| So we did part ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1850)|
| 0:30:54| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1854)|

| 0:30:58| You said they just hit a key, said age okay, and hit the key?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1858)|
| 0:31:03| Yes, and she knows she's supposed to key in the birth date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1863)|
| 0:31:06| I mean, that's the only thing that you have to, what they're supposed to do, no swipe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1866)|
| 0:31:12| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1872)|
| 0:31:15| But she does know what a red stripe is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1875)|
| 0:31:17| She's not colorblind, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1877)|
| 0:31:19| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1879)|
| 0:31:23| This is a third one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1883)|
| 0:31:26| $1,000 fine or 30-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1886)|
| 0:31:31| Make sure that I don't see next month you back in any pilot store back in here, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1891)|
| 0:31:37| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1897)|

| 0:31:57| Opposed say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1917)|
| 0:31:58| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1918)|
| 0:32:00| Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1920)|
| 0:32:01| Mr. Grant, you have an option of a $1,000 fine or a 30-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1921)|
| 0:32:05| $1,000 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1925)|
| 0:32:06| Okay, you have seven days to pay the clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1926)|
| 0:32:08| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1928)|

| 0:32:55| Franklin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1975)|
| 0:32:56| Okay, Mr. Franklin, you've heard the allegations stated against your organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1976)|
| 0:33:01| Do you affirm or deny?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1981)|
| 0:33:03| Affirm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1983)|
| 0:33:04| Affirm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1984)|
| 0:33:05| This is your opportunity to testify before this committee and give them any information you'd like for them to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1985)|
| 0:33:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1991)|
| 0:33:12| Can I have a customer here who wants to talk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1992)|
| 0:33:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1994)|
| 0:33:15| It's a little unusual for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1995)|
| 0:33:18| My name is Carlton Bryant, and I think some of you know that I work for the Knox County Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=1998)|
| 0:33:23| I've talked to Chief May before addressing this board, and I want this board to know some things about Kevin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2003)|
| 0:33:31| I wrote three search warrants for this business prior to Kevin taking over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2011)|
| 0:33:36| This business prior to Kevin taking over was a real problem in South Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2016)|
| 0:33:43| One of the times our narcotics officers were in there and they were openly selling filthy magazines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2023)|
| 0:33:49| that weren't covered properly in the magazine racks, it made the officers more upset than a lot of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2029)|
| 0:33:56| But at any rate, Kevin's come in and done a very good job of cleaning up this market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2036)|
| 0:34:01| And in Kevin's situation, he's gotten a number of it, and he's very proud of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2041)|
| 0:34:06| Every time he gets a letter from my boss, JJ, for passing this, he's very proud of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2046)|
| 0:34:10| And when I came in shortly after this happened, he was distressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2050)|
| 0:34:15| And he showed me what happened on his videotape, and as you've heard from some of these pilot stores,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2055)|
| 0:34:20| Kevin has a system in place that he spent some money for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2060)|
| 0:34:24| And when the clerk scans the card or she punches in the date, and I've seen the video twice, it refused it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2064)|
| 0:34:34| His system was working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2074)|
| 0:34:37| She got frustrated and chose to override the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2077)|
| 0:34:43| And I understand that this board's kind of normal procedure is to assess a $1,000 fine or a 30-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2083)|
| 0:34:51| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2091)|
| 0:34:52| I would just suggest to this board that $1,000 to the pilot corporation versus $1,000 to a fella trying to operate a small business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2092)|
| 0:35:02| It's a little different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2102)|
| 0:35:04| And I heard Mr. Smith ask, you know, why do we have this problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2104)|
| 0:35:08| I've talked to Mike Kidd down at the Bilo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2108)|
| 0:35:11| You know, and why do we have this problem in some of these stores?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2111)|
| 0:35:14| And the problem small stores like Kevin and Mike and the others have is we can't find ñ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2114)|
| 0:35:20| they can't find people quality enough to work in these stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2120)|
| 0:35:24| And so, you know, Kevin's gotten rid of the girl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2124)|
| 0:35:27| He's made sure she went to court and she went through all the stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2127)|
| 0:35:31| But I would just ask you to consider what all good Kevin has done for South Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2131)|
| 0:35:38| when you decide how you want to punish him for what occurred at his store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2138)|
| 0:35:44| And he acknowledges it, but it was something that was very frustrating to Kevin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2144)|
| 0:35:49| Butch, would you give your name and address for the rest of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2149)|
| 0:35:52| My real name is Carlton Bryant Butch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2152)|
| 0:35:54| I live at 3042 McCammon Road in South Knox County, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2154)|
| 0:35:59| How long has it been open in the location?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2159)|
| 0:36:04| Kevin's had it four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2164)|
| 0:36:06| I don't know how long the fella opened prior to Kevin was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2166)|
| 0:36:09| but, again, I wrote the three search warrants for that outfit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2169)|
| 0:36:13| and it was horrible what was going on in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2173)|
| 0:36:17| He was selling the ñ back then the real popular thing was the fake marijuana, the ñ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2177)|
| 0:36:25| Synthetics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2185)|
| 0:36:26| Synthetics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2186)|
| 0:36:28| But there were a lot of problems with that store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2188)|
| 0:36:30| Kevin's had it for four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2190)|
| 0:36:31| I don't know if Chief May has it, but there's been a ñ I'm sure he knows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2191)|
| 0:36:35| There's been a number of times that Kevin's proudly displayed his letter from J.J.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2195)|
| 0:36:39| that, you know, he passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2199)|
| 0:36:47| Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2207)|
| 0:36:48| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2208)|
| 0:36:49| We applaud you for your efforts of doing that and cleaning up that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2209)|
| 0:36:55| I think that because of that, this will be the last time we'll ever have to do this to your store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2215)|
| 0:37:00| It should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2220)|
| 0:37:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2221)|
| 0:37:02| I make a motion that it's a $1,000 fine or a suspension of the license for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2222)|
| 0:37:08| I want to apologize for doing that, but that's what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2228)|
| 0:37:11| That's what this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2231)|
| 0:37:13| And when you break the law, you break the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2233)|
| 0:37:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2236)|
| 0:37:19| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2239)|
| 0:37:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2241)|
| 0:37:23| And I'd like to say, to the point, not to be argumentative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2243)|
| 0:37:27| but $1,000 to Pilot is different than $1,000 to this gentleman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2247)|
| 0:37:32| but the casualties that are caused by these acts are equally the same to everyone that's involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2252)|
| 0:37:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2261)|

| 0:39:04| Mr. Gill, you heard the allegations stated before this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2344)|
| 0:39:07| Do you affirm or deny?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2347)|
| 0:39:09| Affirm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2349)|

| 0:39:21| had been with us just a little under three months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2361)|

| 0:39:43| She simply looked at the birth date, and when she typed in the birth date, typed in the wrong date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2383)|
| 0:39:48| Since this has happened, I have talked with all of my cashiers to make sure that they are looking very closely at the IDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2388)|

| 0:41:32| You've heard the allegations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2492)|
| 0:41:33| Do you affirm or deny those allegations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2493)|
| 0:41:36| I affirm, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2496)|
| 0:41:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2497)|
| 0:41:38| This is your opportunity to state whatever you'd like for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2498)|
| 0:41:40| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2500)|
| 0:41:41| On March 14, 2018, I apologize for an incident that happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2501)|
| 0:41:45| I do understand that this is a serious matter, sir and ma'am,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2505)|
| 0:41:48| and we have corrected our mistake on that same day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2508)|
| 0:41:51| I have now been more aware than ever before, and I have taken action to update the register system where,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2511)|
| 0:41:58| just like the other folks had spoke about it, that we're going to start putting the customer's birth date in there accurately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2518)|
| 0:42:06| and make sure that it clears, only then the customer is eligible to purchase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2526)|
| 0:42:11| However, I've been taking care of this business since the last two and a half years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2531)|
| 0:42:15| This is the first time it ever happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2535)|
| 0:42:17| The employee had forgotten his glasses back home, and this is why, you know, he read it incorrectly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2537)|
| 0:42:24| even though he read it close and punching, of course, incorrect birth date into the system, and that's why it happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2544)|
| 0:42:34| And, I mean, I have suspended the employee for a certain time until I find the new person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2554)|
| 0:42:41| because we have to train them so much to make sure they understand everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2561)|
| 0:42:46| And the employee has already passed the test exam and also paid the state fine and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2566)|
| 0:42:53| I do apologize for this incident, and I will assure that this is not ever going to happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2573)|
| 0:43:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2581)|
| 0:43:02| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2582)|
| 0:43:03| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2583)|
| 0:43:05| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2585)|
| 0:43:08| I am sorry that this happened and that it's in my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2588)|
| 0:43:12| and I do commend you for two and a half years of not being up here before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2592)|
| 0:43:21| So I just want to make sure that you do have some things in place to make sure that it doesn't happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2601)|
| 0:43:31| And I know you didn't mention anything about the red stripe on the driver's license, so if you'll please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2611)|
| 0:43:38| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2618)|
| 0:43:39| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2619)|
| 0:43:40| So, yes, the employee didn't, I guess, knew about the red stripe because he has just recently moved out of state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2620)|
| 0:43:47| so he doesn't really know about the red stripe, but I've made sure, forget about the red stripe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2627)|
| 0:43:52| that you make sure that you enter the birth date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2632)|
| 0:43:54| In fact, I was at the store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2634)|
| 0:43:56| I know this is off the subject, but the customer was very unhappy because I asked him for the ID, and it was a beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2636)|
| 0:44:02| And he was very unhappy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2642)|
| 0:44:03| He cursed at me, and he left the store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2643)|
| 0:44:05| And that's okay because I don't want to face any of these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2645)|
| 0:44:08| So in talking about that, I've already, I went to the tax exam with him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2648)|
| 0:44:13| sat there for five hours and make sure that I personally understand everything for me to train my employees in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2653)|
| 0:44:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2659)|
| 0:44:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2660)|
| 0:44:21| Well, since this is your first offense, and I hope that it will be your first in life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2661)|
| 0:44:29| I will recommend a $1,000 fine or a 30-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2669)|
| 0:44:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2682)|
| 0:44:45| The directors informed me that for your people that work for you, that serve, they have to get a certificate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2685)|
| 0:44:52| They have to go through a program that's approved from the Sheriff's Department for it to be a certified certificate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2692)|
| 0:44:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2698)|
| 0:45:02| Okay, and you can, with any questions, you can speak to Chief Rufy May here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2702)|
| 0:45:08| and also from the Metro Drug Coalition over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2708)|
| 0:45:12| She will be more than happy to help you and educate you on exactly what would be the best way also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2712)|
| 0:45:19| So, again, a $1,000 fine or a 30-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2719)|
| 0:45:24| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2724)|
| 0:45:26| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2726)|
| 0:45:27| The employee still works for you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2727)|
| 0:45:29| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2729)|
| 0:45:30| He's been suspended until I find somebody new because I have to train somebody new anyway to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2730)|
| 0:45:37| because it's so hard for me to find somebody and just hire them because I would have to be with them for the whole time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2737)|
| 0:45:45| to make sure that he or she is not making that mistake again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2745)|
| 0:45:49| I'm okay with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2749)|
| 0:45:50| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2750)|
| 0:45:51| I mean, we're real quick to terminate people versus reassign them until they have further training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2751)|
| 0:45:57| or gradually re-instill them somewhere else in the store because we're very, I'm very sensitive to the nature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2757)|
| 0:46:03| that we just simply terminate good employees for mistakes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2763)|
| 0:46:08| versus layering on additional training and reassigning them somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2768)|
| 0:46:13| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2773)|
| 0:46:14| I just wanted to ask that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2774)|
| 0:46:15| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2775)|
| 0:46:18| Okay, we have a motion before us to either issue a $1,000 fine or a 30-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2778)|
| 0:46:25| Is there any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2785)|

| 0:46:32| Thank you, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2792)|
| 0:46:34| Do you have an option to pay a $1,000 fine or have a 30-day suspension of your license, and what choice do you make?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2794)|
| 0:46:41| I'll do the $1,000 fine, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2801)|
| 0:46:43| Okay, you have seven days to pay the clerk's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2803)|
| 0:46:46| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2806)|

| 0:49:56| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2996)|
| 0:49:57| Mr. Chair, I have a question first before we get into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=2997)|
| 0:50:02| As you look at the application, there are three boxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=3002)|
| 0:50:07| It's on, off, and on slash off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=3007)|
| 0:50:14| So should we have the middle box checked for off premise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=3014)|
| 0:50:20| He's made a mistake when he marked it, so he just wants off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=3020)|
| 0:50:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=3026)|
| 0:50:27| So when you make the motion, if you just say off, it should take care of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=3027)|
| 0:50:30| This is an amended application then for off premise only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=3030)|
| 0:50:35| And it also looks like a different person signed the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=3035)|
| 0:50:38| Is it a Jennifer Armstrong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=3038)|
| 0:50:40| Is that it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=3040)|
| 0:50:41| Or is that just the witness?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=3041)|

| 0:50:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=3046)|
| 0:50:55| Seeing that we need a motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=3055)|
| 0:50:59| I'll make a motion to approve off premise sale of beer at this location pending the turn in of the existing license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=3059)|
| 0:51:08| and the receipt of a certificate of occupancy and a certificate of registration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=3068)|
| 0:51:17| That is my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=3077)|
| 0:51:20| Do I have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=3080)|
| 0:51:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=3081)|

| 0:58:32| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=3512)|
| 0:58:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=3513)|
| 0:58:34| Before we get started, first I want to announce that Mayor Burchett is in our presence today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=3514)|
| 0:58:38| in the very back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=3518)|
| 0:58:39| And we have some other good news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=3519)|
| 0:58:42| Commissioner Carringer became a grandmother this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=3522)|
| 0:58:46| Again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=3526)|
| 0:58:47| Very own Drew, the manager of our commission office, turned 29 today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=3527)|
| 0:58:54| Excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=3534)|
| 0:58:58| And Ed Schaus, our trustee, celebrating a birthday too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=3538)|
| 0:59:03| That was a week last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=3543)|
| 0:59:07| And, of course, the fifth in line prince was born this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=3547)|
| 0:59:11| And I had the little princes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=3551)|
| 0:59:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=3557)|
| 0:59:18| Commissioner Wright, would you please lead us in our devotional?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=3558)|
| 0:59:27| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=3567)|
| 0:59:30| It's indeed a privilege for me to stand before you and bring the devotion this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=3570)|
| 0:59:37| I think the only person here, a couple of people here, may remember a long, long time ago, Bradley and Bud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=3577)|
| 0:59:49| The first time I ever did this, I stood here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=3589)|
| 0:59:54| And I was a shaky-legged commissioner at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=3594)|
| 1:00:01| All that aside, last month, my wife and I, we traveled to Egypt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=3601)|
| 1:00:07| We were there for going on three weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=3607)|
| 1:00:11| And I got back home, and I have this letter that says that I'm asked, I'm requested to lead the devotional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=3611)|
| 1:00:18| Where we traveled in Egypt, on any given day, you could stand with one foot in the sand and one foot on grass nourished by the Nile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=3618)|
| 1:00:34| And it reminded me of what I had to say to commission all those years ago when I first appeared here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=3634)|
| 1:00:42| And it had to do with the story of a man on a dusty road, traveling between cities, who fell upon difficulty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=3642)|
| 1:00:56| And he actually fell. He was in the ditch. He was hurt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=3656)|
| 1:01:01| And those people that were also traveling the road, some of them may have turned around and went back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=3661)|
| 1:01:11| They may have got over a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=3671)|
| 1:01:14| They may have gone to the other side of the road to get by, avoiding the person that was needing help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=3674)|
| 1:01:22| And I guess what I had to say way back then was I wanted us commissioned not to make that mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=3682)|
| 1:01:38| I wanted us to work together and look after those that may have fallen on hard time, needed our help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=3698)|
| 1:01:47| and to do the best we can to continue to negotiate the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=3707)|
| 1:01:55| Since having been on commission now, and I'll say it again, all this long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=3715)|
| 1:02:03| I have come to realize that the other side of that coin can also be applied to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=3723)|
| 1:02:12| We may not be walking down that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=3732)|
| 1:02:16| We may be the person that has fallen over on the side of the road and need help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=3736)|
| 1:02:23| I've seen that in myself here with my fellow commissioners, whether it be large commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=3743)|
| 1:02:31| whether it be new commission, or whether it be people that have just recently been seated on commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=3751)|
| 1:02:37| or looking forward to being on this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=3757)|
| 1:02:41| I want to stand here and tell you I appreciate every one of your smiling faces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=3761)|
| 1:02:50| and not what you've done for me, but what we're here doing for each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=3770)|
| 1:03:01| Now normally, I say whenever I've got a prayer, I'm going to do it with my eyes wide open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=3781)|
| 1:03:11| But I'd like to say these few words in reflection of my time here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=3791)|
| 1:03:20| and our admonishment that we should receive today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=3800)|
| 1:03:25| So if you could take a deep breath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=3805)|
| 1:03:32| Join with me in a moment of silence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=3812)|
| 1:03:36| Let me raise a few more words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=3816)|
| 1:03:41| We give thanks for another day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=3821)|
| 1:03:47| In this room, we pause to offer up gratitude for the gift of this great land in which we live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=3827)|
| 1:04:00| Continue to inspire us through difficult days that we might keep liberty and justice alive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=3840)|
| 1:04:11| Give us the sense of your presence that we may understand each other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=3851)|
| 1:04:20| respect each other, work with each other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=3860)|
| 1:04:26| live with each other, and do good to each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=3866)|
| 1:04:34| Make Knox County great in its goodness and good in its greatness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=3874)|
| 1:04:45| And I say amen and amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=3885)|
| 1:04:51| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=3891)|
| 1:04:53| Thank you, Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=3893)|

| 1:04:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=3899)|
| 1:05:00| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=3900)|
| 1:05:05| and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=3905)|
| 1:05:10| indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=3910)|
| 1:05:31| Okay. If the commission will allow me, I'm going to deviate from our printed agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=3931)|
| 1:05:38| We have several families here for honorary resolutions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=3938)|
| 1:05:42| and I'd like to get to those before we go to public forum, if that's agreeable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=3942)|

| 1:10:30| It's an honor to know you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4230)|

| 1:10:36| what she has done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4236)|

| 1:10:54| for a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4254)|
| 1:10:57| I firmly believe that alcohol and marijuana is a gateway drug| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4257)|
| 1:11:00| and your fight against that is beyond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4260)|
| 1:11:03| and this is a great, great honor for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4263)|

| 1:11:32| For those of you who know me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4292)|
| 1:11:35| know that I just like to be behind the scenes doing my thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4295)|
| 1:11:38| So this is something that I have a hard time doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4298)|
| 1:11:41| So this is something that I have a hard time doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4301)|
| 1:11:44| But anyway, I'm very grateful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4304)|
| 1:11:47| I tell everybody across the state and people I meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4307)|
| 1:11:50| I tell everybody across the state and people I meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4310)|
| 1:11:53| with from other parts of the country and in other states| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4313)|

| 1:11:59| that we are truly blessed here in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4319)|
| 1:12:02| because regardless of who it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4322)|
| 1:12:05| when I'm working on a particular problem or issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4325)|
| 1:12:08| in this community, I can honestly say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4328)|
| 1:12:11| no one will tell me no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4331)|
| 1:12:14| And people will come together, roll up their sleeves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4334)|
| 1:12:17| and try to solve some of the most difficult problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4337)|
| 1:12:20| So, you know, I tell our legislators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4340)|
| 1:12:23| when I meet with them in Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4343)|
| 1:12:26| that I would not live anywhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4346)|
| 1:12:29| Yes, we have problems, but again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4349)|
| 1:12:32| I think we have a community that knows how to come together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4352)|
| 1:12:36| and we know how to work together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4356)|
| 1:12:39| and we know how to put our differences aside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4359)|
| 1:12:42| to really create a better community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4362)|
| 1:12:45| and to help those in need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4365)|
| 1:12:47| I'm very proud to stand here and represent all of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4367)|
| 1:12:51| in the work that I do every day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4371)|
| 1:12:54| and I want to thank you again for this recognition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4374)|
| 1:12:57| I'm very humbled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4377)|
| 1:13:00| And let me just say, I couldn't do it without support staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4380)|
| 1:13:03| that I have. One of them is here with me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4383)|
| 1:13:06| Debra Krause, who you all see on a regular basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4386)|
| 1:13:09| She covers our beer board meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4389)|
| 1:13:12| but she does so much more in the office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4392)|
| 1:13:14| and helping me, too, as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4394)|
| 1:13:17| And then I've got one of my board members here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4397)|
| 1:13:20| Commissioner Carringer, and also Commissioner Bob Thomas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4400)|
| 1:13:23| also serve on the board of directors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4403)|
| 1:13:26| And we have an awesome board and a lot of great support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4406)|
| 1:13:29| in the community, and again, it takes all of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4409)|
| 1:13:32| working together to really deal with some of these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4412)|
| 1:13:35| So I appreciate you all very, very much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4415)|
| 1:13:38| and thank you, and you know how to reach me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4418)|
| 1:13:41| if you need me. Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4421)|
| 1:13:44| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4424)|
| 1:13:47| I've often been accused of asking questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4427)|
| 1:13:50| not knowing the answer, especially the law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4430)|
| 1:13:53| but Ms. Pershing, did I see you at the airport in the last week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4433)|
| 1:13:56| Were you on Honor Air?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4436)|
| 1:13:59| I did. I did go on the Honor Air flight as an escort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4439)|
| 1:14:03| As an escort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4443)|
| 1:14:06| It's something I've always wanted to do, and I finally just said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4446)|
| 1:14:09| you know what, I'm going to take a day and I'm going to go do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4449)|
| 1:14:11| I can tell you, if none of you have been on one of those flights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4451)|
| 1:14:14| I highly recommend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4454)|
| 1:14:17| It was one of the most meaningful things I've ever done in my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4457)|
| 1:14:20| And I've already heard back from my veterans that went with me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4460)|
| 1:14:24| and it's just really a neat experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4464)|
| 1:14:27| And I wanted to make this a twofer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4467)|
| 1:14:30| Would journalist second class Mike Steely please stand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4470)|
| 1:14:35| So you see, I'm making a twofer out of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4475)|
| 1:14:41| Honor Air is the part that we're plugging right at the moment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4481)|
| 1:14:45| but you're involved in it, and there is a result of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4485)|
| 1:14:50| I have also had the honor of being an escort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4490)|
| 1:14:56| and I know what it means, but I also want to recognize the veterans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4496)|
| 1:15:01| in knowing that this is a big deal for the veterans to go on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4501)|
| 1:15:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4506)|
| 1:15:12| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4512)|
| 1:15:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4515)|
| 1:15:18| I just want to say how honored I am to know Karen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4518)|
| 1:15:22| I was on the Metro Drug Coalition Board when we were interviewing Karen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4522)|
| 1:15:27| So we go back a long way, and no one ever tells her no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4527)|
| 1:15:32| because, as you can tell, she is passionate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4532)|
| 1:15:36| If you ask her anything about neonatal babies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4536)|
| 1:15:39| and how well the state of Tennessee has done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4539)|
| 1:15:42| Children's Hospital and UT Hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4542)|
| 1:15:45| they were not seeing the sick babies being addicted to drugs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4545)|
| 1:15:49| because of the great job of Karen going down to our legislation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4549)|
| 1:15:53| and having state laws and everybody working together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4553)|
| 1:15:57| on helping these moms get great child care, baby care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4557)|
| 1:16:03| before their babies are born.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4563)|
| 1:16:04| So she's an honor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4564)|
| 1:16:07| We are very privileged to have her in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4567)|
| 1:16:10| and Mayor Burchett may want to say, add a little tag or two onto that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4570)|
| 1:16:15| Thank you, Karen. We love you, and we appreciate you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4575)|
| 1:16:22| Thank you, Grandmother. I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4582)|
| 1:16:25| It's a pleasure being here with Karen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4585)|
| 1:16:27| The opioid addiction issue is just, you can't escape it anymore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4587)|
| 1:16:31| and we're addressing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4591)|
| 1:16:33| and I'm delighted at the work that Karen's doing on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4593)|
| 1:16:36| All the way from the top to the bottom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4596)|
| 1:16:38| we've got to address it as a community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4598)|
| 1:16:40| and as our faith-based institutions and as our families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4600)|
| 1:16:43| So I really appreciate the great work you've done on that, Karen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4603)|
| 1:16:46| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4606)|
| 1:17:02| Steely Dunn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4622)|
| 1:17:07| For the record, Mr. Chairman, I've already signed that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4627)|
| 1:17:10| and he tried to get me to sign the vetoed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4630)|
| 1:17:12| so I approved it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4632)|
| 1:17:22| Mayor, you've signed all these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4642)|
| 1:17:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4651)|

| 1:18:27| No? And it won't slide?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4707)|
| 1:18:31| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4711)|

| 1:21:17| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4877)|
| 1:21:19| First, let me acknowledge that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4879)|
| 1:21:21| I am a Gibbs High School graduate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4881)|
| 1:21:26| Long time ago, no wrestling team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4886)|
| 1:21:29| but I do have to thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4889)|
| 1:21:31| the Knox County Board of Education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4891)|
| 1:21:34| superintendent present here with us this evening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4894)|
| 1:21:38| for this opportunity to stand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4898)|
| 1:21:40| and represent Gibbs High School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4900)|
| 1:21:43| and say congratulations to this group of young people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4903)|
| 1:21:47| at their accomplishments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4907)|
| 1:21:49| Sometimes in life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4909)|
| 1:21:51| it's difficult to get a good foothold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4911)|
| 1:21:54| on what's taking place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4914)|
| 1:21:56| because you have to build a team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4916)|
| 1:21:59| before you can make some progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4919)|
| 1:22:03| Sports in high school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4923)|
| 1:22:05| are that opportunity to build teamwork,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4925)|
| 1:22:08| to know who you can depend upon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4928)|
| 1:22:11| and to improve yourself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4931)|
| 1:22:13| at supporting the team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4933)|
| 1:22:15| I would like to introduce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4935)|
| 1:22:16| the coach of the Gibbs High School wrestling team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4936)|
| 1:22:20| for a few words at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4940)|
| 1:22:23| I'd like to thank the County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4943)|
| 1:22:25| and Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4945)|
| 1:22:27| Thank you so much for this honor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4947)|

| 1:22:32| These boys and girl right here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4952)|
| 1:22:35| in our girls wrestling team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4955)|
| 1:22:37| and then we've got our girls coach here, Lisa,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4957)|
| 1:22:40| and all the rest of my coaching staff here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4960)|
| 1:22:42| are just phenomenal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4962)|
| 1:22:43| Great leaders, great role models,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4963)|
| 1:22:46| and then these kids are able to come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4966)|
| 1:22:48| and see some of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4968)|
| 1:22:50| And then wrestling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4970)|
| 1:22:52| which I think is one of the hardest sports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4972)|
| 1:22:54| in the entire sports realm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4974)|
| 1:22:57| and these kids stuck with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4977)|
| 1:22:59| They knew what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4979)|
| 1:23:01| We had a plan from the minute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4981)|
| 1:23:03| to win that state title,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4983)|
| 1:23:05| and they never deviated from that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4985)|
| 1:23:07| and we continued on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4987)|
| 1:23:09| and they just blew my mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4989)|
| 1:23:11| on what they were able to accomplish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4991)|
| 1:23:13| It was above beyond what we were even thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4993)|
| 1:23:16| We thought we would win it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4996)|
| 1:23:18| but what they did was even more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=4998)|
| 1:23:20| And we'd just like to thank you so much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5000)|
| 1:23:23| for recognizing all the hard work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5003)|
| 1:23:26| the blood, the sweat, the tears,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5006)|
| 1:23:28| all the things nobody really sees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5008)|
| 1:23:30| You see us holding up this trophy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5010)|
| 1:23:32| but it's a lot more than just holding up a trophy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5012)|
| 1:23:35| and the pride that they will have now forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5015)|
| 1:23:38| They will forever be state champions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5018)|
| 1:23:40| And I also just want to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5020)|
| 1:23:41| Keegan Cooch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5021)|
| 1:23:43| he is part of the Honor Air Guard service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5023)|
| 1:23:50| He really did a couple things with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5030)|
| 1:23:53| They were talking about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5033)|
| 1:23:55| and he was, hey, I did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5035)|

| 1:24:16| It's just been a goal of ours for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5056)|

| 1:24:20| at Gibbs High School wrestling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5060)|
| 1:24:23| And without Coach Pittman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5063)|
| 1:24:25| I would not have had my own state title.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5065)|
| 1:24:27| And I just hope that my younger teammates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5067)|
| 1:24:30| will go on to win another state title.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5070)|

| 1:30:15| somewhere on Earth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5415)|

| 1:31:11| and it was a great race| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5471)|
| 1:31:13| and we got to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5473)|
| 1:31:15| we sort of had some issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5475)|
| 1:31:17| during the campaign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5477)|
| 1:31:19| but we got to be great friends after that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5479)|
| 1:31:21| and I think he's the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5481)|
| 1:31:23| without question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5483)|
| 1:31:24| the best male guy in town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5484)|
| 1:31:26| for political campaigns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5486)|
| 1:31:28| and we'll miss him for a lot more than that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5488)|
| 1:31:30| but he was a great friend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5490)|
| 1:31:32| Sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5492)|
| 1:31:33| Lynn worked in my very first campaign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5493)|
| 1:31:35| in 1994| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5495)|
| 1:31:37| and we knocked on doors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5497)|
| 1:31:39| and it was out of 99 house races.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5499)|
| 1:31:41| We were the only person to beat an incumbent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5501)|
| 1:31:43| in the entire state that year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5503)|
| 1:31:45| and it was primarily due| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5505)|
| 1:31:47| to the great data mining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5507)|
| 1:31:49| of Lynn Redman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5509)|
| 1:31:50| That's a word everybody uses now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5510)|
| 1:31:52| but back then nobody did it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5512)|
| 1:31:54| and he did it masterfully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5514)|
| 1:31:56| I remember he gave me all the lists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5516)|
| 1:31:58| of all the people's doors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5518)|
| 1:32:00| I needed to knock on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5520)|
| 1:32:01| for the unbelievable price| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5521)|
| 1:32:03| of $200.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5523)|
| 1:32:05| And I remember I went to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5525)|
| 1:32:07| when I first was elected to Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5527)|
| 1:32:09| I went and all these computer folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5529)|
| 1:32:11| were down there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5531)|
| 1:32:12| and they pulled up in their big fancy semis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5532)|
| 1:32:14| and they had all this computer hardware| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5534)|
| 1:32:16| and they were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5536)|
| 1:32:17| I remember the guy said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5537)|
| 1:32:19| that they could probably,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5539)|
| 1:32:21| I asked him if they could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5541)|
| 1:32:23| and I gave him the criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5543)|
| 1:32:25| that Lynn had used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5545)|
| 1:32:26| and I believe it was somewhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5546)|
| 1:32:28| in the neighborhood of $10,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5548)|
| 1:32:29| and I said we should have gotten with Lynn Redman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5549)|
| 1:32:31| and we should have got a business together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5551)|
| 1:32:33| He was wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5553)|
| 1:32:34| There's none like him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5554)|
| 1:32:35| and there'll never be another one like him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5555)|
| 1:32:37| He'll be missed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5557)|
| 1:32:43| Lynn, when I first got on the MPC in 1991,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5563)|
| 1:32:48| he was the one that encouraged me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5568)|
| 1:32:50| not just to come to the meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5570)|
| 1:32:52| but get out and see everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5572)|
| 1:32:54| that was brought before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5574)|
| 1:32:56| And at every meeting thereafter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5576)|
| 1:32:57| he also encouraged me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5577)|
| 1:32:58| to be out there too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5578)|
| 1:33:00| And so it was a lively discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5580)|
| 1:33:02| we always had between each other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5582)|

| 1:39:09| and talk about some things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5949)|
| 1:39:11| We came down there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5951)|
| 1:39:13| and he made time out for me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5953)|
| 1:39:15| and then I was proud to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5955)|
| 1:39:17| that I asked him if we could have a public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5957)|
| 1:39:19| and I had folks from the TBI and the FBI there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5959)|
| 1:39:21| and he said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5961)|
| 1:39:23| yeah, I think we can probably put you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5963)|
| 1:39:25| a little thing together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5965)|
| 1:39:27| and I was assuming it would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5967)|
| 1:39:29| in a small little classroom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5969)|
| 1:39:31| and when I got down there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5971)|
| 1:39:33| if you knew anything about Doug Sager,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5973)|
| 1:39:35| there was nothing small,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5975)|
| 1:39:37| there was nothing bigger, actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5977)|
| 1:39:39| and I came in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5979)|
| 1:39:41| and then I hit the button,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5981)|
| 1:39:43| and this screen comes down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5983)|
| 1:39:45| and it's like something out of Disney World| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5985)|
| 1:39:47| or something, I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5987)|
| 1:39:49| I was in awe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5989)|
| 1:39:51| and of course, the FBI and the TBI were like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5991)|
| 1:39:53| man, what did you all get me into,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5993)|
| 1:39:55| and we actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=5995)|

| 1:40:01| we passed some of the toughest laws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6001)|
| 1:40:03| in the country that year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6003)|
| 1:40:05| dealing with folks that would offend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6005)|
| 1:40:07| the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6007)|

| 1:40:23| I've already been frisked twice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6023)|
| 1:40:25| before I could enter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6025)|
| 1:40:27| but no, I'm Greg Coleman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6027)|

| 1:40:31| I won't go into how I feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6031)|
| 1:40:33| about Brother Doug,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6033)|
| 1:40:35| because it would take too long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6035)|
| 1:40:37| but he's one of the members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6037)|
| 1:40:39| of the adopted family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6039)|

| 1:40:43| because she's on the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6043)|
| 1:40:45| but in any event, her name's Candace,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6045)|
| 1:40:47| so I'll put that in the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6047)|

| 1:40:59| and his much better and beautiful wife, Vicki,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6059)|
| 1:41:01| and then we've got, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6061)|
| 1:41:03| Faye's already introduced the family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6063)|
| 1:41:05| but what Brother Doug meant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6065)|
| 1:41:07| and what he put his words into,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6067)|
| 1:41:09| but I'll remember forever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6069)|
| 1:41:11| as many of us do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6071)|

| 1:41:43| to see if by chance he could be here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6103)|

| 1:46:38| as provided by the Charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6398)|
| 1:46:40| of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6400)|
| 1:46:42| the public welfare requiring it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6402)|
| 1:46:44| Thank you, Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6404)|
| 1:46:46| It's quite an honor to come before you today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6406)|
| 1:46:48| to memorize Mr. Harbin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6408)|
| 1:46:50| In 2007, when I was contemplating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6410)|
| 1:46:52| running for office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6412)|
| 1:46:54| Mr. Harbin invited me into his home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6414)|
| 1:46:56| to give me some advice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6416)|
| 1:46:58| and kind of talk about his history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6418)|
| 1:47:00| and what he had done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6420)|
| 1:47:02| and until you read and listen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6422)|
| 1:47:04| to the impact he had as a commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6424)|
| 1:47:06| and as a father and as a community member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6426)|
| 1:47:08| there was a lot of people that got jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6428)|
| 1:47:10| because of his work and his family's work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6430)|
| 1:47:12| and Levi's came to Powell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6432)|
| 1:47:14| and made a difference in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6434)|
| 1:47:16| and I think that's what we all strive for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6436)|
| 1:47:18| so we assume, since our role up there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6438)|
| 1:47:20| we assume you guys had sacrificed in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6440)|
| 1:47:22| He was a father to us for a time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6442)|
| 1:47:24| and we appreciate the service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6444)|
| 1:47:26| that he had to our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6446)|
| 1:47:28| so thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6448)|
| 1:47:37| I can stand, but I can't walk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6457)|
| 1:47:41| I'll keep this very brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6461)|
| 1:47:44| Thank you to all the commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6464)|
| 1:47:48| for this recognition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6468)|
| 1:47:50| of my father's achievements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6470)|
| 1:47:52| in life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6472)|
| 1:47:54| It means so much to our family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6474)|
| 1:47:57| and he will be missed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6477)|
| 1:48:00| but the good thing about my father| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6480)|
| 1:48:03| was he loved to make the wheels turn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6483)|
| 1:48:06| and everything he did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6486)|
| 1:48:09| whether it's building, developing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6489)|
| 1:48:12| or even working for county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6492)|
| 1:48:14| in politics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6494)|
| 1:48:16| he wanted to make something happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6496)|
| 1:48:18| and he was a good man to work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6498)|
| 1:48:22| He was a good man in that respect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6502)|
| 1:48:24| and the one thing that I will say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6504)|
| 1:48:26| that he inspired in me in growing up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6506)|
| 1:48:30| was if I wanted something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6510)|
| 1:48:32| I had to get a job and work for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6512)|
| 1:48:34| and that's the way he was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6514)|
| 1:48:36| He never asked for anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6516)|
| 1:48:38| that he wasn't willing to work for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6518)|
| 1:48:40| but our family appreciates this recognition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6520)|
| 1:48:43| and it is a real honor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6523)|
| 1:48:46| and thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6526)|
| 1:48:48| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6528)|
| 1:48:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6532)|
| 1:49:05| Okay, we'll go back to our as-written agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6545)|
| 1:49:09| and move on to public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6549)|
| 1:49:12| The first speaker I have is Scott Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6552)|
| 1:49:18| Mr. Davis, do you wish to speak to something in general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6558)|
| 1:49:20| or something specific to our agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6560)|
| 1:49:23| In general, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6563)|
| 1:49:25| Okay, so you probably want to go ahead and go now, then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6565)|
| 1:49:27| Yeah, I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6567)|
| 1:49:29| Scott Davis, Fieldbox 11315, Knoxville 37939.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6569)|
| 1:49:31| I appreciate y'all's service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6571)|
| 1:49:33| I know you've got a lot on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6573)|
| 1:49:35| I'll make it brief, and very readily, as you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6575)|
| 1:49:37| do I come and speak at the public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6577)|
| 1:49:39| but a couple things I would like for y'all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6579)|
| 1:49:41| to think about going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6581)|
| 1:49:43| As you know, MPC right now consists of 15 members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6583)|
| 1:49:45| There's eight appointed by the Knox County mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6585)|
| 1:49:47| seven appointed by the city mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6587)|
| 1:49:48| The largest number of votes before MPC right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6588)|
| 1:49:50| are split votes between city representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6590)|
| 1:49:52| and county representatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6592)|
| 1:49:54| My question for you all today is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6594)|
| 1:49:56| why are city appointees allowed to vote on county matters?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6596)|
| 1:50:01| If I'm a county property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6601)|
| 1:50:03| and I'm not happy with the mayor's appointments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6603)|
| 1:50:05| I can vote or help vote to vote out the county mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6605)|
| 1:50:09| I don't have the same right with the city mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6609)|
| 1:50:12| So, therefore, I am disenfranchised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6612)|
| 1:50:14| and misrepresented on MPC as a county property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6614)|
| 1:50:18| because I have no recourse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6618)|
| 1:50:20| with the city appointed members of MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6620)|
| 1:50:23| So I would like for you all to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6623)|
| 1:50:25| at some point moving forward to split MPC vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6625)|
| 1:50:28| whereby city MPC appointed commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6628)|
| 1:50:31| do not vote on county matter issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6631)|
| 1:50:33| because county residents are not properly represented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6633)|
| 1:50:36| by city appointed commissioners to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6636)|
| 1:50:39| Not that MPC city appointees would consider doing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6639)|
| 1:50:43| but there may be a motive to make it as difficult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6643)|
| 1:50:45| to develop in the county as it is in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6645)|
| 1:50:46| to force people back into the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6646)|
| 1:50:49| I'm not saying that's what MPC representatives do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6649)|
| 1:50:51| but that is a possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6651)|
| 1:50:53| So please consider that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6653)|
| 1:50:55| and it puts a lot of burden on you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6655)|
| 1:50:57| When you have a split MPC vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6657)|
| 1:50:59| it puts more pressure on you all, the county commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6659)|
| 1:51:01| And just to consider that as we look going forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6661)|
| 1:51:05| as you all well know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6665)|
| 1:51:07| there's only two ways to increase the tax base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6667)|
| 1:51:09| You can either raise taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6669)|
| 1:51:11| or you have economic development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6671)|
| 1:51:13| that creates new tax revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6673)|
| 1:51:15| As we move forward with MPC as it is right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6675)|
| 1:51:18| we will probably be looking at a tax increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6678)|
| 1:51:21| because it's getting more and more and more difficult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6681)|
| 1:51:23| to develop in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6683)|
| 1:51:25| I'll make it real brief again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6685)|
| 1:51:27| I've done my first project up in Sevier County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6687)|
| 1:51:29| I went to their planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6689)|
| 1:51:31| stood up to the podium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6691)|
| 1:51:33| and they said, Mr. Davis, thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6693)|
| 1:51:35| Thank you for investing your hard-earned dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6695)|
| 1:51:37| in Sevier County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6697)|
| 1:51:39| Thank you for helping create jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6699)|
| 1:51:41| Thank you for helping keep our property taxes high| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6701)|
| 1:51:44| and low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6704)|
| 1:51:46| And thank you for making affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6706)|
| 1:51:48| Mr. Davis, what can we do for you today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6708)|
| 1:51:52| We don't hear that here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6712)|
| 1:51:55| I appreciate you all's time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6715)|
| 1:51:57| Thank you again for your service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6717)|
| 1:51:59| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6719)|
| 1:52:01| Next we have Trustee Ed Schaus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6721)|
| 1:52:09| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6729)|
| 1:52:11| Ed Schaus, 1301 Wilshire Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6731)|
| 1:52:13| I'm here to respond to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6733)|
| 1:52:15| I guess, your question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6735)|
| 1:52:17| at the finance meeting a week ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6737)|
| 1:52:19| What would be the financial impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6739)|
| 1:52:21| of the reassessment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6741)|
| 1:52:23| as it relates to the pallets?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6743)|
| 1:52:26| That's an acronym for payment in lieu of taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6746)|
| 1:52:28| for the utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6748)|
| 1:52:30| Well, you have a brief cheat sheet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6750)|
| 1:52:32| in front of you there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6752)|
| 1:52:34| The reassessment, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6754)|
| 1:52:36| dropped 232 to 212.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6756)|
| 1:52:39| This sounds like a typical,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6759)|
| 1:52:41| a political answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6761)|
| 1:52:43| I had nothing to do with the appraisal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6763)|
| 1:52:46| nor does my colleague, John Whitehead,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6766)|
| 1:52:48| had anything to do with the appraisals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6768)|
| 1:52:50| as far as the utilities are concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6770)|
| 1:52:53| The assessment dropped from 505 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6773)|
| 1:52:57| to 488 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6777)|
| 1:53:00| And with the 232 dropping to 212,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6780)|
| 1:53:03| we're looking at a $753,000 loss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6783)|
| 1:53:06| A $753,000 shortfall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6786)|
| 1:53:10| So that's the bottom line of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6790)|
| 1:53:12| I do have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6792)|
| 1:53:14| I'll be happy if anyone wants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6794)|
| 1:53:16| a hard copy or an email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6796)|
| 1:53:18| There are 204 utilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6798)|
| 1:53:20| that we send tax bills to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6800)|
| 1:53:22| The biggest one is, of course, KUB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6802)|
| 1:53:24| Norfolk Southern Railroad, Comcast,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6804)|
| 1:53:26| but then there's 170 more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6806)|
| 1:53:29| that you've probably never heard of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6809)|
| 1:53:31| Private rail car companies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6811)|
| 1:53:33| and just pipelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6813)|
| 1:53:34| colonial pipeline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6814)|
| 1:53:36| they pay a pretty good amount of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6816)|
| 1:53:38| I think they pay over $100,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6818)|
| 1:53:40| But that's the bottom line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6820)|
| 1:53:42| about a $750,000 hit to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6822)|
| 1:53:46| And it's something that I've had discussions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6826)|
| 1:53:49| since we talked Monday with Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6829)|
| 1:53:54| Our growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6834)|
| 1:53:56| our increase in revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6836)|
| 1:54:00| is up about 3.5 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6840)|
| 1:54:02| this year over last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6842)|
| 1:54:05| And so if this were not on the books,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6845)|
| 1:54:09| we'd probably be up $4,300,000 or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6849)|
| 1:54:13| So it is an impact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6853)|
| 1:54:16| a negative impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6856)|
| 1:54:18| How are their properties assessed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6858)|
| 1:54:20| How are their properties assessed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6860)|
| 1:54:22| How are they appraised?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6862)|
| 1:54:24| It's done on the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6864)|
| 1:54:26| State appraisers do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6866)|
| 1:54:28| So if we stay revenue neutral| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6868)|
| 1:54:29| when we do our reassessments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6869)|
| 1:54:33| did that happen or did we drop $750,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6873)|
| 1:54:36| or did that $750,000 get spread to other residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6876)|
| 1:54:39| to keep us at revenue neutral?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6879)|
| 1:54:41| I wouldn't think this is revenue neutral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6881)|
| 1:54:46| That would be more of an assessor question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6886)|
| 1:54:48| But you see a drop of, what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6888)|
| 1:54:51| about 4%, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6891)|
| 1:54:53| I don't know how they use that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6893)|
| 1:54:55| I mean, it's got to be multiple appraisers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6895)|
| 1:54:57| to appraise a railroad, a pipeline, a Comcast,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6897)|
| 1:55:01| a utility district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6901)|
| 1:55:03| I don't know what methodology they would use, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6903)|
| 1:55:07| I see Chris walking by there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6907)|
| 1:55:09| Chris?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6909)|
| 1:55:11| At 3 quarters of a million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6911)|
| 1:55:14| we used to use a penny in sales tax per million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6914)|
| 1:55:17| So that would be 3 quarters of a penny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6917)|
| 1:55:19| I think after the new assessments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6919)|
| 1:55:21| you and I talked and it's really like 1.15 now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6921)|
| 1:55:23| So this is almost 80% of a percent loss in sales tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6923)|
| 1:55:27| property tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6927)|
| 1:55:29| And I think, keep in mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6929)|
| 1:55:31| that these public utilities are basically viewed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6931)|
| 1:55:34| as a payment in lieu of taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6934)|
| 1:55:36| So I don't want to speak for Mr. Whitehead,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6936)|
| 1:55:38| but I think if you looked at his schedule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6938)|
| 1:55:40| that he had to prepare to do his new assessment rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6940)|
| 1:55:44| I bet you pilots are not included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6944)|
| 1:55:46| I bet you it's just the taxable base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6946)|
| 1:55:49| So we've been through how many of these reassessments now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6949)|
| 1:55:51| without raising property tax?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6951)|
| 1:55:53| Oh, wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6953)|
| 1:55:55| Five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6955)|
| 1:55:57| It's 20 years, you've got five assessments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6957)|
| 1:55:59| So can we figure that possibly 500 to 700,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6959)|
| 1:56:03| has been lost each time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6963)|
| 1:56:05| The question is, and we can get what Mr. Whitehead is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6965)|
| 1:56:09| I don't think that pilots are included| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6969)|
| 1:56:12| on the state's schedule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6972)|
| 1:56:14| when they determine your new tax rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6974)|
| 1:56:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6976)|
| 1:56:18| That's why there's a decrease, would be my guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6978)|
| 1:56:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6982)|
| 1:56:23| Well, thank you guys for looking that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6983)|
| 1:56:24| It's very helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6984)|
| 1:56:26| Let me give you one more number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6986)|
| 1:56:28| If you do the numbers on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6988)|
| 1:56:30| as you know, your home is assessed at 25%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6990)|
| 1:56:34| your business at 40,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6994)|
| 1:56:36| this is at 55.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6996)|
| 1:56:37| So just to make the numbers work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6997)|
| 1:56:39| use the 55 ratio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=6999)|
| 1:56:41| Okay. Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7001)|
| 1:56:45| Next we have Todd Shelton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7005)|
| 1:56:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7007)|
| 1:56:54| Hello, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7014)|
| 1:56:55| If you would, please give your name and address for the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7015)|
| 1:56:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7018)|
| 1:56:59| Todd Shelton, and I'm at 3111 Foster Lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7019)|
| 1:57:02| in South Knox County, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7022)|
| 1:57:07| It's been some years since I've been before this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7027)|
| 1:57:10| and I want to appreciate the hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7030)|
| 1:57:12| I know that y'all put in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7032)|
| 1:57:15| to get the job done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7035)|
| 1:57:17| I want to share with you some feelings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7037)|
| 1:57:19| I have about the budget of the Knox County school system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7039)|
| 1:57:22| which I know is coming your way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7042)|
| 1:57:25| in the next week or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7045)|
| 1:57:27| I found myself attending their school board meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7047)|
| 1:57:32| and following up on education issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7052)|
| 1:57:34| that are important to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7054)|
| 1:57:36| My wife and I had two children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7056)|
| 1:57:38| go all the way through the Knox County schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7058)|
| 1:57:41| and we were both quite active| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7061)|
| 1:57:43| in the parent and teacher organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7063)|
| 1:57:46| in those times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7066)|
| 1:57:48| Looking back, I wish I had been more attentive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7068)|
| 1:57:51| to how the whole system was working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7071)|
| 1:57:53| instead of just what my kids needed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7073)|
| 1:57:56| but it's never too late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7076)|
| 1:57:59| Myself, along with others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7079)|
| 1:58:01| who have been asking for improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7081)|
| 1:58:03| in certain areas of the school system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7083)|
| 1:58:06| have also realized that the current budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7086)|
| 1:58:08| for the school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7088)|
| 1:58:10| does not allow for any wiggle room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7090)|
| 1:58:12| for new helpful programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7092)|
| 1:58:13| such as needed teacher raises,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7093)|
| 1:58:16| much needed increases in specialty personnel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7096)|
| 1:58:19| to support the teachers' work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7099)|
| 1:58:22| It seems that the school budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7102)|
| 1:58:24| has shrunk as a percentage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7104)|
| 1:58:26| of the entire county budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7106)|
| 1:58:29| by about 4% over the last 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7109)|
| 1:58:33| By some people's figures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7113)|
| 1:58:35| that would mean an extra $35 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7115)|
| 1:58:38| for the school system today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7118)|
| 1:58:40| if it had remained at that percentage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7120)|
| 1:58:43| that it was at 20 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7123)|
| 1:58:46| There have also been no local tax increases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7126)|
| 1:58:49| for education in over 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7129)|
| 1:58:52| During this same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7132)|
| 1:58:54| the school system itself has grown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7134)|
| 1:58:56| in student numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7136)|
| 1:58:58| and the number of employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7138)|
| 1:59:00| Data has shown that there are increases needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7140)|
| 1:59:03| in certain personnel positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7143)|
| 1:59:05| and that we are losing good teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7145)|
| 1:59:07| to other school systems who pay more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7147)|
| 1:59:10| Thanks to new and old ways merging together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7150)|
| 1:59:14| to create improvements in the curriculum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7154)|
| 1:59:17| there have been new programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7157)|
| 1:59:19| such as project grad programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7159)|
| 1:59:21| magnet and STEM programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7161)|
| 1:59:23| community schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7163)|
| 1:59:25| programs like PBIS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7165)|
| 1:59:27| and restorative practice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7167)|
| 1:59:29| and cultural competency trainings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7169)|
| 1:59:31| made available to the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7171)|
| 1:59:34| They all need to be implemented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7174)|
| 1:59:35| in a real timely manner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7175)|
| 1:59:38| without adding more work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7178)|
| 1:59:40| to the classroom teacher jobs definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7180)|
| 1:59:43| Many times when a new program comes in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7183)|
| 1:59:45| it's one more thing added on the teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7185)|
| 1:59:48| in the classroom who are already overworked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7188)|
| 1:59:52| Our teachers' classes' sizes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7192)|
| 1:59:54| are way too large for good instruction as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7194)|
| 1:59:58| This means more teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7198)|
| 2:00:00| as well as more specialty teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7200)|
| 2:00:02| such as trainers, social workers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7202)|
| 2:00:05| special study teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7205)|
| 2:00:08| and special behavior consultants are needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7208)|
| 2:00:11| The funding we get from the state is not enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7211)|
| 2:00:15| and it will always fluctuate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7215)|
| 2:00:17| and will never be enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7217)|
| 2:00:19| to satisfy the increased needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7219)|
| 2:00:21| and growth of our school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7221)|
| 2:00:23| I feel it is up to us NACA citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7223)|
| 2:00:26| to make the school system work successfully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7226)|
| 2:00:29| with new needed funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7229)|
| 2:00:32| I don't like taxes that are wasted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7232)|
| 2:00:35| Nobody does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7235)|
| 2:00:37| However, I feel proud to be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7237)|
| 2:00:39| to pay taxes that provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7239)|
| 2:00:42| for a number one school program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7242)|
| 2:00:44| with well-paid teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7244)|
| 2:00:46| providing great instruction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7246)|
| 2:00:48| and kids who graduate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7248)|
| 2:00:50| with skills and learning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7250)|
| 2:00:52| that will strengthen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7252)|
| 2:00:54| any community they live in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7254)|
| 2:00:56| I just wanted to let you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7256)|
| 2:00:58| as the county commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7258)|
| 2:01:00| know that I'm not alone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7260)|
| 2:01:02| and when I say I feel it is time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7262)|
| 2:01:03| to do more and raise the taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7263)|
| 2:01:05| of our county school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7265)|
| 2:01:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7267)|
| 2:01:09| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7269)|
| 2:01:11| Next, we have Daniel Garrigan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7271)|
| 2:01:13| I believe I'm saying that correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7273)|
| 2:01:15| And, sir, I have down here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7275)|
| 2:01:17| Twin Creek Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7277)|
| 2:01:19| Would you rather wait| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7279)|
| 2:01:21| until that item comes up on the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7281)|
| 2:01:23| Okay, I'll remember to pull you up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7283)|
| 2:01:25| back down whenever that comes up, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7285)|
| 2:01:27| Last, I have a Carl Wheeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7287)|
| 2:01:30| Mr. Wheeler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7290)|
| 2:01:33| How are you, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7293)|
| 2:01:35| If you would, please give your name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7295)|
| 2:01:37| and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7297)|
| 2:01:39| Doing fine, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7299)|
| 2:01:41| Carl Wheeler, 2631 Bakertown Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7301)|
| 2:01:43| Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7303)|
| 2:01:45| Been a resident of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7305)|
| 2:01:47| for 30 plus years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7307)|
| 2:01:49| I, as my predecessor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7309)|
| 2:01:51| just spoke here a minute ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7311)|
| 2:01:53| had two children that went| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7313)|
| 2:01:55| through the county school systems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7315)|
| 2:01:57| and I'm glad to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7317)|
| 2:01:59| that they went on to college| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7319)|
| 2:02:01| and now they're helping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7321)|
| 2:02:03| with their retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7323)|
| 2:02:05| But seriously speaking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7325)|
| 2:02:07| you folks are the folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7327)|
| 2:02:09| that make the decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7329)|
| 2:02:11| for where the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7331)|
| 2:02:12| spends its money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7332)|
| 2:02:14| That includes the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7334)|
| 2:02:16| School board's task| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7336)|
| 2:02:18| is to provide to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7338)|
| 2:02:20| a viable, real,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7340)|
| 2:02:22| needed budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7342)|
| 2:02:24| for you to take action on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7344)|
| 2:02:26| to satisfy the needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7346)|
| 2:02:28| of Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7348)|
| 2:02:30| And as Mr. Shelton said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7350)|
| 2:02:31| we've had a lot of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7351)|
| 2:02:33| that have happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7353)|
| 2:02:34| in the school systems here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7354)|
| 2:02:36| over the last 15, 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7356)|
| 2:02:38| In addition to that growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7358)|
| 2:02:40| that comes with schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7360)|
| 2:02:42| and children and families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7362)|
| 2:02:44| moving in and additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7364)|
| 2:02:46| children coming into the system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7366)|
| 2:02:48| the costs have risen every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7368)|
| 2:02:53| However, it appears| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7373)|
| 2:02:55| that the budget needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7375)|
| 2:02:57| to maintain that school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7377)|
| 2:02:59| has been staggered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7379)|
| 2:03:01| back maybe 10, 15 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7381)|
| 2:03:03| So the issue now before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7383)|
| 2:03:06| is do we want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7386)|
| 2:03:08| that class A school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7388)|
| 2:03:10| or do we want something less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7390)|
| 2:03:12| than the class A school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7392)|
| 2:03:14| And if we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7394)|
| 2:03:15| and I think we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7395)|
| 2:03:17| want the class A school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7397)|
| 2:03:19| then we must provide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7399)|
| 2:03:21| through your support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7401)|
| 2:03:23| we must provide the services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7403)|
| 2:03:25| the financial resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7405)|
| 2:03:27| that the school board needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7407)|
| 2:03:29| to provide an exceptional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7409)|
| 2:03:31| level of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7411)|
| 2:03:33| I was thinking earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7413)|
| 2:03:35| about some of the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7415)|
| 2:03:37| that Mr. Shelton mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7417)|

| 2:03:53| that adequate treatment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7433)|

| 2:04:04| that when the county school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7444)|
| 2:04:06| puts together their budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7446)|
| 2:04:08| and I sincerely believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7448)|

| 2:09:50| for the past 13 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7790)|
| 2:09:53| First, I'd like to thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7793)|
| 2:09:54| Commissioner Daley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7794)|
| 2:09:55| for bringing the issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7795)|
| 2:09:57| of this dump site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7797)|
| 2:09:58| before this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7798)|
| 2:10:00| And I would also like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7800)|
| 2:10:01| the commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7801)|
| 2:10:02| I believe most of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7802)|
| 2:10:03| went down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7803)|
| 2:10:04| and took a look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7804)|
| 2:10:05| at the dump site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7805)|
| 2:10:08| just its sheer magnitude| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7808)|
| 2:10:10| and the longevity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7810)|
| 2:10:12| of its existence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7812)|
| 2:10:13| is just a disgrace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7813)|
| 2:10:15| to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7815)|
| 2:10:17| And I believe that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7817)|
| 2:10:19| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7819)|
| 2:10:20| some have said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7820)|
| 2:10:21| it's been there for 30 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7821)|
| 2:10:22| but talking to some people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7822)|
| 2:10:24| who have lived| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7824)|
| 2:10:25| down in south Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7825)|
| 2:10:27| it's more like 80 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7827)|
| 2:10:30| I actually own property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7830)|
| 2:10:32| one of my driveways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7832)|
| 2:10:34| is I own two wells| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7834)|
| 2:10:36| on the 38 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7836)|
| 2:10:37| that I own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7837)|
| 2:10:39| The dump by the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7839)|
| 2:10:40| is three-tenths of a mile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7840)|
| 2:10:42| from my house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7842)|
| 2:10:43| The dump itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7843)|
| 2:10:46| is 800 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7846)|
| 2:10:47| from my property line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7847)|
| 2:10:49| and I have 1,500 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7849)|
| 2:10:51| of that branch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7851)|
| 2:10:52| of Twin Creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7852)|
| 2:10:53| which originates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7853)|
| 2:10:54| at the headwaters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7854)|
| 2:10:55| in that dump| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7855)|
| 2:10:56| that runs across my property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7856)|
| 2:10:59| And this is not something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7859)|
| 2:11:01| that's an abstract thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7861)|
| 2:11:03| to me at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7863)|
| 2:11:04| and it has nothing to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7864)|
| 2:11:06| with the convenience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7866)|
| 2:11:07| of how I get to my property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7867)|
| 2:11:09| It's all about the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7869)|
| 2:11:11| that this is a hazard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7871)|
| 2:11:12| to the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7872)|
| 2:11:13| of south Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7873)|
| 2:11:15| and the dump| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7875)|
| 2:11:17| is creating a hazard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7877)|
| 2:11:19| that not only originates there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7879)|
| 2:11:21| in the people around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7881)|
| 2:11:23| from the mosquitoes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7883)|
| 2:11:24| that are born| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7884)|
| 2:11:25| down in the thousands of tires| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7885)|
| 2:11:27| that are down in the dump,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7887)|
| 2:11:29| they can travel up to three miles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7889)|
| 2:11:31| to infect people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7891)|
| 2:11:32| with encephalitis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7892)|
| 2:11:34| and Zika| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7894)|
| 2:11:35| and West Nile virus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7895)|
| 2:11:38| and the rats| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7898)|
| 2:11:40| that would be attracted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7900)|
| 2:11:42| to the food| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7902)|
| 2:11:43| and other things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7903)|
| 2:11:44| from household garbage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7904)|
| 2:11:46| carry diseases, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7906)|
| 2:11:48| and the insects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7908)|
| 2:11:50| that are carried on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7910)|
| 2:11:52| those rats and the mice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7912)|
| 2:11:54| I would like to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7914)|
| 2:11:56| that I've spoken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7916)|
| 2:11:57| over 13 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7917)|
| 2:11:58| with the codes enforcement people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7918)|
| 2:12:00| the county engineering division,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7920)|
| 2:12:02| the law department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7922)|
| 2:12:03| and they've all been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7923)|
| 2:12:04| very responsive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7924)|
| 2:12:07| especially here recently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7927)|
| 2:12:08| when I've spoken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7928)|
| 2:12:09| with a lot of the commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7929)|
| 2:12:11| personally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7931)|
| 2:12:12| to say that this is something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7932)|
| 2:12:14| that's gone on long enough,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7934)|
| 2:12:15| and I think it needs to be addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7935)|
| 2:12:18| by closing the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7938)|
| 2:12:19| Anything other than closing that road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7939)|
| 2:12:22| will be inefficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7942)|
| 2:12:25| We will be spending county money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7945)|
| 2:12:27| to clean up the dump,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7947)|
| 2:12:29| and as soon as the road is open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7949)|
| 2:12:30| the dump will resume| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7950)|
| 2:12:32| because the dump| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7952)|
| 2:12:33| has been cleaned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7953)|
| 2:12:34| in previous occasions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7954)|
| 2:12:35| approximately in 2000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7955)|
| 2:12:37| and 1,000 feet of fence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7957)|
| 2:12:39| six-foot chain-link fence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7959)|
| 2:12:40| was put up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7960)|
| 2:12:41| and the fence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7961)|
| 2:12:42| was immediately knocked down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7962)|
| 2:12:44| and the dumping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7964)|
| 2:12:45| continued unabated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7965)|
| 2:12:46| until now it's grown back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7966)|
| 2:12:48| to what you saw| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7968)|
| 2:12:49| when you visited the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7969)|
| 2:12:51| in the last few weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7971)|
| 2:12:53| I have heard some of the arguments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7973)|
| 2:12:56| against closing the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7976)|
| 2:12:58| and one of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7978)|
| 2:12:59| is the security| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7979)|
| 2:13:00| of Harris Chapel Baptist Church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7980)|
| 2:13:02| and I understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7982)|
| 2:13:03| and I know that there was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7983)|
| 2:13:04| an arson committed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7984)|
| 2:13:05| at that church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7985)|
| 2:13:06| and it was burned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7986)|
| 2:13:07| but I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7987)|
| 2:13:08| that with the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7988)|
| 2:13:09| engineering department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7989)|
| 2:13:11| maybe putting up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7991)|
| 2:13:12| some more lights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7992)|
| 2:13:13| and maybe even some cameras,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7993)|
| 2:13:15| that their security| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7995)|
| 2:13:16| would actually be better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7996)|
| 2:13:17| In addition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7997)|
| 2:13:18| once the road is closed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=7998)|
| 2:13:20| the people that live| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8000)|
| 2:13:21| on Twin Creek Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8001)|
| 2:13:22| would begin to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8002)|
| 2:13:23| who is going down that road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8003)|
| 2:13:25| and who should not be there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8005)|
| 2:13:27| and there shouldn't be any traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8007)|
| 2:13:28| there late at night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8008)|
| 2:13:29| so I would submit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8009)|
| 2:13:30| that the increased insecurity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8010)|
| 2:13:32| would be better for the church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8012)|
| 2:13:33| not worse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8013)|
| 2:13:35| because the road was actually open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8015)|
| 2:13:36| when the church was burned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8016)|
| 2:13:38| so I can't see how that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8018)|
| 2:13:40| would bear on it anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8020)|
| 2:13:44| As far as it being a hardship,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8024)|
| 2:13:46| I understand that it may be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8026)|
| 2:13:48| two miles and a four minute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8028)|
| 2:13:49| travel time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8029)|
| 2:13:50| which I'm perfectly willing to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8030)|
| 2:13:53| in order to get to where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8033)|
| 2:13:55| I need to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8035)|
| 2:13:56| up in North Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8036)|
| 2:13:58| You know, the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8038)|
| 2:14:02| spends our tax money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8042)|
| 2:14:04| in order to clean this up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8044)|
| 2:14:05| and it should go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8045)|
| 2:14:07| and make the hard decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8047)|
| 2:14:08| Pretty much any decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8048)|
| 2:14:09| this board ever makes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8049)|
| 2:14:11| makes somebody unhappy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8051)|
| 2:14:13| and generally the laws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8053)|
| 2:14:15| that are passed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8055)|
| 2:14:16| by any government body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8056)|
| 2:14:17| is an inconvenience to somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8057)|
| 2:14:19| I just had an inconvenience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8059)|
| 2:14:21| with a 1040 form last weekend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8061)|
| 2:14:24| as you most probably did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8064)|
| 2:14:26| and I believe that voting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8066)|
| 2:14:28| to close that section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8068)|
| 2:14:30| of Twin Creek Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8070)|
| 2:14:31| is the only way that that dump| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8071)|
| 2:14:33| will not reappear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8073)|
| 2:14:35| and cause pollution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8075)|
| 2:14:37| not only from the dump site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8077)|
| 2:14:39| across all the adjacent properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8079)|
| 2:14:41| down Twin Creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8081)|
| 2:14:43| down to Stock Creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8083)|
| 2:14:44| down to the Little River,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8084)|
| 2:14:46| and ultimately down to Loudoun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8086)|
| 2:14:48| All those property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8088)|
| 2:14:49| and uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8089)|
| 2:14:50| anybody that comes in contact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8090)|
| 2:14:52| with the water,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8092)|
| 2:14:53| is potentially going to be harmed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8093)|
| 2:14:55| by whatever is dumped there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8095)|
| 2:14:57| and I do appreciate your hard work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8097)|
| 2:14:59| on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8099)|
| 2:15:00| and thank you for letting me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8100)|
| 2:15:02| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8102)|
| 2:15:04| Commissioner Gill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8104)|
| 2:15:05| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8105)|
| 2:15:06| Did you say you had property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8106)|
| 2:15:08| on the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8108)|
| 2:15:09| or you lived on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8109)|
| 2:15:10| Twin Creek Road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8110)|
| 2:15:19| Would you just come to the mic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8119)|
| 2:15:20| I was just trying to clarify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8120)|
| 2:15:21| if you lived on Twin Creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8121)|
| 2:15:23| or you have property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8123)|
| 2:15:24| on Twin Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8124)|
| 2:15:25| I have two properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8125)|
| 2:15:26| on Twin Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8126)|
| 2:15:27| So you live there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8127)|
| 2:15:28| No, I have a rental house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8128)|
| 2:15:29| on Twin Creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8129)|
| 2:15:31| and another house on Twin Creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8131)|
| 2:15:33| I use for recreation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8133)|
| 2:15:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8135)|
| 2:15:36| But that, to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8136)|
| 2:15:38| makes no difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8138)|
| 2:15:39| whether I live there or not, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8139)|
| 2:15:41| I mean, would you like to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8141)|
| 2:15:43| the contents of that dump| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8143)|
| 2:15:44| flowing across 1,500 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8144)|
| 2:15:47| of a creek that is entirely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8147)|
| 2:15:49| contained on my property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8149)|
| 2:15:51| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8151)|
| 2:15:52| So the fact that I live there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8152)|
| 2:15:54| makes no difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8154)|
| 2:15:55| The fact that I have to, year-round,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8155)|
| 2:15:58| have to have that junky creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8158)|
| 2:16:00| flowing through my property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8160)|
| 2:16:02| that is more than an inconvenience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8162)|
| 2:16:04| That makes no difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8164)|
| 2:16:05| where I live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8165)|
| 2:16:06| I own that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8166)|
| 2:16:08| And so I think that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8168)|
| 2:16:10| completely irrelevant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8170)|
| 2:16:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8172)|
| 2:16:14| Commissioner Busler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8174)|
| 2:16:16| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8176)|
| 2:16:17| This is a question, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8177)|
| 2:16:18| for the legal department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8178)|
| 2:16:20| If you have property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8180)|
| 2:16:22| that touches this road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8182)|
| 2:16:24| or you're affected by the closure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8184)|
| 2:16:25| of this road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8185)|
| 2:16:27| is there any violation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8187)|
| 2:16:28| to the rights of those people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8188)|
| 2:16:29| that live on that road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8189)|
