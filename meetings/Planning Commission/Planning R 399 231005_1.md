| 3:01:26| I think would like to let them speak if that's okay for all right. Do we have opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=10886)|
| 3:01:43| Irene would in Jerry would 536 Coram Road, Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=10903)|
| 3:01:49| 37924 where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=10909)|

| 3:01:55| west border of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=10915)|
| 3:01:58| the property that's a question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=10918)|
| 3:02:00| If we could pull that up, and if we could also pull up the satellite view of that as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=10920)|
| 3:02:20| If we can zoom in please| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=10940)|
| 3:02:25| I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=10945)|
| 3:02:49| Think there was a satellite view further up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=10969)|
| 3:02:55| We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=10975)|
| 3:03:11| Are the property to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=10991)|
| 3:03:16| Northwest of that entire boundary and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=10996)|
| 3:03:20| if there wasn't that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11000)|
| 3:03:22| Grid the yellow grid there you would see that there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11002)|
| 3:03:27| Canvas camping on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11007)|
| 3:03:30| Mr.. Bramwell's property on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11010)|
| 3:03:34| what the Western| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11014)|
| 3:03:39| East| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11019)|
| 3:03:48| So it's the western portion of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11028)|
| 3:03:52| By which he's looking to have rezoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11032)|
| 3:03:56| Has three canvas on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11036)|
| 3:04:00| stilts tents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11040)|
| 3:04:02| We were here last time. We don't have any objection to him having his commercial businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11042)|
| 3:04:08| His rural retreats his places where he has people stay overnight, and there's other buildings on there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11048)|
| 3:04:16| we only had an issue with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11056)|
| 3:04:19| the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11059)|
| 3:04:21| canvas tents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11061)|
| 3:04:22| Being within the 200 foot offset| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11062)|
| 3:04:27| Which was there to protect us if it was a rural retreat?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11067)|
| 3:04:32| now apparently there is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11072)|
| 3:04:34| Another application to have it changed from the rural retreat to open spaces which would allow campgrounds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11074)|
| 3:04:41| So our concerns are the same these are canvas tents which are allowed indoor propane tanks for heating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11081)|
| 3:04:48| and it had also has a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11088)|
| 3:04:51| Campsites with open fires with that are within 20 feet of our property, so we are pretty familiar with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11091)|
| 3:05:00| Process and if you have already made up your minds that you're going to grant this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11100)|
| 3:05:08| Zoning so that he can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11108)|
| 3:05:10| Sort of skirt the 200 feet protection that we did have to now having virtually no protection from their campsites| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11110)|
| 3:05:21| And that their condition is that he an erect a fence on the western portion of that property which we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11121)|
| 3:05:29| Which borders our property and which is all densely forest?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11129)|
| 3:05:35| Since this commercial enterprise a mr.. Bramwell's enterprise has been running for three years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11135)|
| 3:05:43| Without any approval from zoning and is now coming to you to ask for this if if this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11143)|
| 3:05:51| Going to be your approval for now from rural from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11151)|
| 3:05:54| Agricultural to a rural retreat to open spaces allowing for open campgrounds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11154)|
| 3:05:59| We are going to ask you that you kindly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11159)|
| 3:06:05| Decide what type of fencing would be provided for our protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11165)|
| 3:06:11| Any sort of oversight and any sort of deadline to have this fencing completed again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11171)|
| 3:06:19| He has been running this commercial business. He doesn't live there for three years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11179)|
| 3:06:24| without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11184)|
| 3:06:25| Applying for any sort of zoning and we're asking for protection for our property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11185)|
| 3:06:36| Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11196)|
| 3:06:44| Thank you, I'm gonna respond to a couple of the comments that were made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11204)|
| 3:06:47| One being the offset for the rural retreat is 200 feet for an open space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11207)|
| 3:06:52| I believe it's 20 feet or 32 feet from the boundary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11212)|
| 3:06:56| It is a dense 10 acre forest can't see it. They actually didn't know about us until| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11216)|
| 3:07:02| We actually went to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11222)|
| 3:07:05| Respectfully to request a waiver several months ago, so that's why this process is happening this way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11225)|
| 3:07:11| The other thing is it's you know a dense forest, so you don't really need a fence if you have a forest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11231)|
| 3:07:16| I mean, that's a fence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11236)|
| 3:07:17| It's a huge barrier with slopes and you know, I couldn't even walk through there without being covered in poison ivy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11237)|
| 3:07:23| So that's the one thing I would say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11243)|
| 3:07:25| The other thing is the reason we were operating is because we thought it was lodging was permitted in the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11245)|
| 3:07:30| I do have Airbnbs on the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11250)|
| 3:07:32| So it wasn't to be a campground. It's I mean, these are you know permanent structures. They're not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11252)|
| 3:07:39| Transient tents so with staff recommendation and the help of the Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11259)|
| 3:07:44| Staff we've been told that this really should be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11264)|
| 3:07:48| Classified as open space and that's the best way to use this property. So it wasn't out of I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11268)|
| 3:07:53| Guess blatant disregard of this Commission. It was just we thought it was lodging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11273)|
| 3:07:57| Which was something I have run for several years in the property with Airbnb. So that's a response to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11277)|
| 3:08:04| Of course, we are within the open space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11284)|
| 3:08:08| You know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11288)|
| 3:08:09| Preservation zone recreational use everything that I've read on the Tennessee website says that this is a great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11289)|
| 3:08:15| Use of the land and for preservation and public enjoyment and all the all the good things that we like the outside to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11295)|
| 3:08:22| So that's my only response. I'm happy to take any questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11302)|
| 3:08:30| Commissioner she'll so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11310)|
| 3:08:32| so for staff or maybe for codes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11312)|
| 3:08:36| engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11316)|
| 3:08:38| So we we reasoned this are we granted a special use for rural retreat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11318)|

| 3:08:46| That's why there's a 200 foot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11326)|
| 3:08:50| minimum buffer for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11330)|
| 3:08:53| lodging so correct so the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11333)|
| 3:08:56| Few months a couple months ago. I can't remember but there was a rural retreat approved on the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11336)|
| 3:09:01| There's actually another one this month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11341)|
| 3:09:04| The rural retreat does allow lodging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11344)|
| 3:09:06| But the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11346)|
| 3:09:09| The lodging has to be outside of the buffers if you're not outside the buffers any of the waivers and so on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11349)|
| 3:09:16| So, I mean it does there is a rural retreat approval though within and within open space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11356)|
| 3:09:21| Camping is defined as what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11361)|
| 3:09:25| exactly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11365)|
| 3:09:26| there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11366)|
| 3:09:29| There's nothing in the county ordinance that explicitly says camping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11369)|
| 3:09:33| But there's a use in open space that allows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11373)|
| 3:09:39| Camps and resorts and that's the closest that we really can get resort campgrounds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11379)|
| 3:09:47| So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11387)|
| 3:09:48| yeah, I guess I mean what I kind of see here is, you know an applicant that was trying to become properly zoned and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11388)|
| 3:09:55| Get his lodgings which are as he said is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11395)|
| 3:09:59| basically a permanent tent or a type of structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11399)|
| 3:10:03| within compliance and then a neighbor doesn't want to sign the waiver and this seems to kind of be like a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11403)|
| 3:10:10| Workaround for it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11410)|
| 3:10:12| and so I guess in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11412)|
| 3:10:14| terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11414)|
| 3:10:16| It doesn't make me fully comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11416)|
| 3:10:19| Voting for it knowing that neighbor is not approving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11419)|
| 3:10:23| Something that if they would approve they would be fine. It seems to me. So I guess I would just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11423)|
| 3:10:36| So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11436)|
| 3:10:38| Trying to think of how to purchase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11438)|
| 3:10:41| They they already have air Airbnbs on the site, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11441)|
| 3:10:44| So like an Airbnb anybody can rent out a house right now in the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11444)|
| 3:10:49| As an Airbnb unless they change their the rules but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11449)|
| 3:10:54| Doesn't have to be tied to a road retreat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11454)|
| 3:10:57| Now if you have something that's more than just a house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11457)|
| 3:11:00| Then or something that's different like a tent like or with the glamping. That's not a house. That's not a permitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11460)|
| 3:11:08| Residential structure so you can't use that same rules. You still got to come in compliance with the zoning. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11468)|
| 3:11:15| if they didn't have the road retreat component, which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11475)|
| 3:11:18| now approved anyways outside of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11478)|
| 3:11:22| They could have come through and asked for a campground or OS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11482)|
| 3:11:27| It's really is the camping use going to be appropriate in this in this location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11487)|
| 3:11:32| They will have to come back through use or development plan approval to the Planning Commission before the campground can be approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11492)|
| 3:11:39| So I wouldn't necessarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11499)|
| 3:11:42| Curry I wouldn't encourage you to think about it as I'm trying to skirt the rules. It's just there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11502)|
| 3:11:47| I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11507)|
| 3:11:48| Think of it as two separate uses all together. They are two separate uses. You have a road retreat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11508)|
| 3:11:52| That's one thing and then you have a campground. That's another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11512)|
| 3:12:02| Let's see any other commissioner shall so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11522)|
| 3:12:10| I'll make a motion we approve per staffs recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11530)|
| 3:12:16| We've got a motion to approve for staff recommendation, we have a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11536)|
| 3:12:23| If I can get a clarification on the fence that they've asked for then I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11543)|
| 3:12:30| Second that motion would did you want to include the fence type as they requested? I'll include that. Yes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11550)|
| 3:12:46| I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11566)|
| 3:13:02| There we go, what kind of fence is better than I mean, I'm telling you can't walk through these this forest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11582)|
| 3:13:08| So that's the only thing and in response to mr. Shell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11588)|
| 3:13:11| So I it's not to skirt the rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11591)|
| 3:13:13| It's just the best use of the property and it's if you want to come visit sometime. It's just very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11593)|
| 3:13:18| Naturey everybody's hanging out. It's very very calm. So not trying to violate anybody's privacy in any way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11598)|
| 3:13:26| Okay, so the staff recommendation says to install a fence in 60 days is staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11606)|
| 3:13:31| Comfortable with the type of fence that we're expecting to see. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11611)|
| 3:13:35| would leave that to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11615)|
| 3:13:37| Your guys's discretion as to if you want it to be something more like a split rail fence that may be more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11617)|
| 3:13:48| Easy it easier to install given the rustic nature of the terrain or if you guys wanted it to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11628)|
| 3:13:55| Something a little bit more robust| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11635)|
| 3:13:59| Commissioner and that is also something that I can be determined during development plan review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11639)|
| 3:14:05| Because they will have to come back through for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11645)|
| 3:14:13| Can you may want to leave it one at one option is leave it to the discretion of the staff I'm fine with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11653)|
| 3:14:21| well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11661)|
| 3:14:22| I'm curious what the intention of the fence is because a split rail fence doesn't offer privacy or really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11662)|
| 3:14:30| Split rail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11670)|
| 3:14:31| Accomplishes providing, you know, here's where you are leaving one area and going into another which I don't know if that's what the opposition's desire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11671)|
| 3:14:39| Is they may split rails obviously not going to obscure to the applicants point the forest obscures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11679)|
| 3:14:46| But there may be something else that the fence is supposed to be doing so I was going to ask I'm seeing the nod of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11686)|
| 3:14:50| The head that I think that's their desire is just to define the boundary. Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11690)|
| 3:14:55| Yeah, and that's what I was trying to respect based on their previous comments that they made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11695)|
| 3:15:00| during the rural retreat and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11700)|
| 3:15:02| To demark the property to prevent guests from traversing on to their site because it's all one wooded area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11702)|
| 3:15:09| So if a camper were to want to go walk in the woods while they camp| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11709)|
| 3:15:14| They would run into the fence that makes sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11714)|
| 3:15:17| The nice thing about a split rail as well is that it means that the wildlife can do what it wants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11717)|
| 3:15:23| It's yeah, not blocking it. Yeah, so if I was cherry was that a second or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11723)|
| 3:15:29| Or no, okay, it was a second. All right. Okay. We have a motion and a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11729)|

| 3:19:27| with the the South Knox Community Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11967)|
| 3:19:30| And there was a large meeting with that and a lot of the comments that were were generated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11970)|
| 3:19:35| We talked about it. We're following that that meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11975)|
| 3:19:38| At the zoning meeting there were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11978)|
| 3:19:41| Miss Hooper. Mr. Proctor and Kim of the I think Harper the three neighbors to the south that came up and said hey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11981)|
| 3:19:48| You really haven't reached out to us directly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11988)|
| 3:19:50| we're the ones that access the property through the easement and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11990)|
| 3:19:54| You should you would think we would talk to us too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11994)|
| 3:19:58| and we said we'll be happy to speak with you guys and talk to you all further and we've had a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=11998)|
| 3:20:04| Lot of engagement with them to the point where they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12004)|
| 3:20:08| Those neighbors did not oppose the rezoning at the density that we requested and actually one of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12008)|
| 3:20:14| Talked about the need for additional infrastructure out there, but was in support of the density that we were requesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12014)|
| 3:20:19| We've had several meetings with those individuals. We did not have another overall large meeting. We we talked to and I read mr. Thompson's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12019)|
| 3:20:29| Comment on it actually he and I spoke before he submitted the comment. He told me he was going to submit it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12029)|
| 3:20:35| We asked if we should come to the September| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12035)|
| 3:20:39| Community Association meeting and again, we talked to Commissioner Carson Daly about that and he said he didn't think that there was a need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12039)|
| 3:20:47| That the neighbors to the south were the ones that were primarily affected by this as long as we were continuing to work with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12047)|
| 3:20:53| He was he was satisfied with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12053)|
| 3:20:55| so we didn't go to that September meeting because there wasn't any perceived need for it and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12055)|
| 3:21:01| And as I understand it this this didn't even come up during that meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12061)|
| 3:21:04| So we did engage with those those neighbors that said we hadn't in the past and I think they are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12064)|
| 3:21:13| Supportive of it with the landscaping screening that we've proposed or that has been conditioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12073)|
| 3:21:17| I appreciate you lining out for all those neighbors that weren't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12077)|
| 3:21:22| Contacted and weren't part of that kind of trio that so they now hear from you as to what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12082)|
| 3:21:27| What dialogue did take place and if you were advised that it wasn't necessary for you to go to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12087)|
| 3:21:33| We talked about whether we needed to go to the September meeting and and the council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12093)|
| 3:21:37| They were told no, we don't we don't think so because the Commissioner Daly knew we were talking to mr. Proctor ms. Hooper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12097)|
| 3:21:45| Mr. And mrs. Dr. And mrs. May and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12105)|
| 3:21:49| Mr. I think it's a Harper his name is the one that I have trouble| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12109)|
| 3:21:54| But yeah, we and we had a meeting actually mr. Mays office with all of them and they had counsel at that meeting. So yes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12114)|
| 3:22:01| great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12121)|
| 3:22:03| Commissioner Higgins, thank you. I brought this up at our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12123)|
| 3:22:08| Meeting on Tuesday, but I noticed that there are no sidewalks apart from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12128)|
| 3:22:14| directly on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12134)|
| 3:22:16| Main road there. Well, no, there's existing sidewalks that and then there's a sidewalk included in the corner connecting to the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12136)|
| 3:22:24| I understand that this does not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12144)|
| 3:22:27| May not meet a threshold, but I'd like to my biggest concern here is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12147)|
| 3:22:32| This is going to be I think this would be very appealing for families with students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12152)|
| 3:22:39| going to the high school and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12159)|
| 3:22:41| I think getting to those sidewalks to get to the high school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12161)|
| 3:22:46| Poses some safety risks in terms of having to walk on the streets, especially if you've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12166)|
| 3:22:52| High school drivers as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12172)|
| 3:22:55| You know young drivers who tend to be a little bit faster and less aware of their surroundings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12175)|
| 3:23:01| So I would really like to see some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12181)|
| 3:23:05| Sidewalks here and I'd like to ask engineering if there's any way to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12185)|
| 3:23:11| If y'all think that it might be more appropriate to have a little bit more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12191)|
| 3:23:17| Pedestrian| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12197)|
| 3:23:18| Route on here. Yes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12198)|
| 3:23:20| We discussed this internally with our staff and we debated it back and forth and after the agenda review the other day me and Jim| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12200)|
| 3:23:27| Discussed and we would be open if you want to include it as a condition Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12207)|
| 3:23:32| would accept those sidewalks along road a and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12212)|
| 3:23:35| Potentially part of Road B there to make that loop and we would accept those and maintain them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12215)|
| 3:23:42| Okay, great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12222)|
| 3:23:45| With that I would like to make a motion to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12225)|
| 3:23:50| for staffs recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12230)|
| 3:23:53| We've got three motions here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12233)|
| 3:23:55| one you have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12235)|
| 3:23:58| The motion motion number one be the alternate design standards. So you take care of that one first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12238)|
| 3:24:04| All right motion to approve the alternate design standards per staffs recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12244)|
| 3:24:11| second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12251)|
| 3:24:13| Motion by Commissioner Higgins second by Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12253)|
| 3:24:16| Schultz. Oh| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12256)|
| 3:24:19| All in favor say aye| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12259)|
| 3:24:21| Opposed. No| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12261)|
| 3:24:22| Let's have it motion. Number two is the concept plan where you could add that condition and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12262)|
| 3:24:28| Sure. Can I just address the sidewalks as on that because I know that's a condition that wasn't on the on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12268)|
| 3:24:35| It was and I know it came up at the agenda review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12275)|
| 3:24:37| I did talk to my clients about it and then and I respect where you're coming from with these sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12277)|
| 3:24:43| I think my client would prefer that not be a condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12283)|
| 3:24:48| The reasons for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12288)|
| 3:24:49| I mean we're looking at really trying to hit a specific price point for these slots at sub| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12289)|
| 3:24:55| 350,000 try to keep that them affordable and the the sidewalks are an additional expense to that that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12295)|
| 3:25:02| You know may push that price point up. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12302)|
| 3:25:05| Would say, you know, I live in an older neighborhood without sidewalks level hills, you know, it's got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12305)|
| 3:25:11| You know wide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12311)|
| 3:25:13| wide streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12313)|
| 3:25:14| And you know, we we walk on on the side of the street and then there's not an issue with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12314)|
| 3:25:20| The streets here are 26 feet in width and have a 50-foot right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12320)|
| 3:25:25| That's wider than Tipton station the the road that accesses it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12325)|
| 3:25:29| So I think that you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12329)|
| 3:25:31| There is an opportunity for safe pedestrian access respectfully on that and we we really would not want that condition on there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12331)|
| 3:25:38| But understand Higgins on Tuesday. Did you talk about going from Tipton station just on the main road to the intersection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12338)|
| 3:25:47| Really anywhere, but I think that the sidewalks that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12347)|
| 3:25:53| Would be applicable would just be on or that engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12353)|
| 3:25:59| mentioned would just be on a and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12359)|
| 3:26:02| Part of B. And so I think that that would be probably connecting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12362)|
| 3:26:08| The kind of the center area of the neighborhood up to Tipton station and then probably trying to get a little bit of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12368)|
| 3:26:17| Direction over to that cul-de-sac where the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12377)|
| 3:26:19| Where the sidewalk to the the school is so, you know, I that doesn't really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12379)|
| 3:26:25| completely satisfy my concern because I think that even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12385)|
| 3:26:29| residents of affordable housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12389)|
| 3:26:32| Should be protected as well, but I think that that's a good start. So I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12392)|
| 3:26:40| Highway Department, did you understand that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12400)|
| 3:26:42| I remember a little bit of this conversation on Tuesday and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12402)|
| 3:26:45| Remember you bringing up just the main road as it came to the intersection. I don't remember any conversations past that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12405)|
| 3:26:51| Did you and your staff talk about that anymore? Yes, we would be okay with just road a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12411)|
| 3:26:55| There is a stub out. It's what there's 72 units now, so you wouldn't need but like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12415)|
| 3:27:01| 28 more to trip that thousand ADT. So and then they would be warranted by the ordinance. So road a would be fine with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12421)|
| 3:27:09| and with that if if there were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12429)|
| 3:27:12| more units coming in from that stub out would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12432)|
| 3:27:16| They would sidewalks need to be built on these roads. It would only be streets where the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12436)|
| 3:27:25| Daily trips would exceed a thousand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12445)|
| 3:27:27| so I think you I think the only street that would potentially trip that would be the road a the main road in I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12447)|
| 3:27:37| Don't believe there's enough property at the rear that you would get many more units to trip it on the other roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12457)|
| 3:27:42| well, I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12462)|
| 3:27:45| Road B, which is the one that you know, the main road comes in and then Road B| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12465)|
| 3:27:50| Kind of connects it to the east there where that other sidewalk is. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12470)|
| 3:27:55| Think it's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12475)|
| 3:27:58| Out of the question or you know too much to ask to include a small sidewalk there it's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12478)|
| 3:28:07| handful of lots and really not a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12487)|
| 3:28:10| very long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12490)|
| 3:28:12| Route and I I just don't I can't imagine that having a large impact on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12492)|
| 3:28:18| Portability of the units, but I do think that if those are the two directions where pedestrians will be going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12498)|
| 3:28:24| getting to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12504)|
| 3:28:26| That sidewalk would be you know a pretty good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12506)|
| 3:28:32| Get having something where people could land and then get to the main| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12512)|
| 3:28:36| Sidewalks on the corners. I think would be pretty good. So I would still include in my motion to a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12516)|
| 3:28:45| Condition to put a sidewalk on Road a and then a sidewalk on Road B| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12525)|
| 3:28:53| Connecting over to Road D. Okay, I let me ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12533)|
| 3:28:57| Director Brooks about this real quick. So as I understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12537)|
| 3:29:03| We can ask an applicant to do sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12543)|
| 3:29:07| But we can't require that and and we ask about a participation with the highway department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12547)|
| 3:29:14| Because they have a sidewalk ordinance that does not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12554)|
| 3:29:17| require them to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12557)|
| 3:29:19| Maintain those sidewalks and they are trying to participate on a road if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12559)|
| 3:29:24| or a section of sidewalk if the applicant agrees to it so you can ask but I don't think there's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12564)|
| 3:29:32| Tell director Brooks. Yes that that is correct vice-chair Odin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12572)|
| 3:29:41| So it can't be included as a condition not unless the applicant is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12581)|
| 3:29:46| Willing to do so and the highway department would have to concur on this amount of sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12586)|
| 3:29:52| Director Snowden, I see you wanting to talk. Yeah, I tend to agree. We were under the impression that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12592)|
| 3:29:58| the applicant would be willing to install the sidewalks, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12598)|
| 3:30:03| Because they originally showed on the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12603)|
| 3:30:05| But if if now that they are, you know in somewhat opposition to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12605)|
| 3:30:11| The ordinance is clear that you know, we can't enforce that condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12611)|
| 3:30:15| So I think it would be very problematic to add that as a condition from from the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12615)|
| 3:30:24| I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12624)|
| 3:30:25| Guess the question for the applicant is would you all be interested in a sidewalk on Road A?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12625)|
| 3:30:33| I'd have to consult with with my client obviously on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12633)|
| 3:30:37| I know that you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12637)|
| 3:30:37| we we did go through several different versions of this trying to get to the plan that made the most sense for this property and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12637)|
| 3:30:43| for what we were trying to accomplish and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12643)|
| 3:30:46| It is part of that that we we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12646)|
| 3:30:49| Ended up taking the sidewalks off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12649)|
| 3:30:53| All right, I do not have a motion then all right, so I would be seeking a motion for the concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12653)|
| 3:31:01| Commissioner Huber| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12661)|
| 3:31:02| Yeah, I'd like to make a motion to approve the concept plan subject to the nine conditions listed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12662)|
| 3:31:09| Have a second. So yeah| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12669)|
| 3:31:12| Mr. Browning seconds to approve the concept set plans to subject to the nine conditions all in favor. Say aye| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12672)|

| 3:31:52| Those no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12712)|

| 3:32:54| There's a traffic impact study that was done that recommended a turn lane on Emory Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12774)|
| 3:33:00| If we so we could approve up to 66 lots based on the traffic impact study before the potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12780)|
| 3:33:07| Turn lane was recommended on Emory Road of which the state I think is in the process of acquiring right away to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12787)|
| 3:33:14| And they've come up with new how they figure traffic impact studies recently and with the new traffic analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12794)|
| 3:33:22| It can now go to 80 before a turn lane is recommended on Emory Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12802)|
| 3:33:27| that was submitted to staff and to engineering and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12807)|
| 3:33:31| so we're respectfully requesting to allow us to go to 80 lots on our plot as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12811)|
| 3:33:38| Opposed to the 66 because of the new traffic impact analysis that was done in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12818)|
| 3:33:43| addition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12823)|
| 3:33:45| As you all are much aware where three months ago this would not be coming before you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12825)|
| 3:33:51| There was a cork in state law whereby staff was administratively able to approve flats| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12831)|
| 3:33:57| Right now with lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12837)|
| 3:33:59| 25 and more it has to come back before you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12839)|
| 3:34:03| So all I'm asking today is that you'll approve the plat for 80 lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12843)|
| 3:34:08| We still have to jump through all the hoops with engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12848)|
| 3:34:11| We still have to jump through all the hoops with with Knox County planning before they'll sign the plat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12851)|
| 3:34:16| If we cannot meet all that criterion, they won't sign the plat and we can't record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12856)|
| 3:34:21| So all I'm doing today is respectfully asking you all to allow us to plot 80 lights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12861)|
| 3:34:27| Which the traffic impact analysis supports we still have to go to engineering. They still have to analyze everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12867)|
| 3:34:33| They will not sign the plat until and unless we meet all of their criterion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12873)|
| 3:34:39| So that's my request today is we approve the plat for 80 lots and allow me to continue to work with staff and in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12879)|
| 3:34:46| Staff report if you look in the comments of the staff report, it says this could be approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12886)|
| 3:34:53| administratively by planning staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12893)|
| 3:34:56| This allows me to go to that next step with planning staff. You're all's next meeting is 35 days away. We have asphalt down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12896)|
| 3:35:04| It cost me a thousand thirty five dollars a day in interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12904)|
| 3:35:09| That's almost forty thousand dollars. That's going to cost me to wait until the next meeting to get this approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12909)|
| 3:35:17| Okay, if you all approve it today, we still go through the planning staff. They still have authority not to sign the plat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12917)|
| 3:35:24| Engineering still has authority not to sign the plat. This just allows me to move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12924)|
| 3:35:32| Thank you, can I get someone from staff to comment on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12932)|
| 3:35:38| Where we are it looks to me like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12938)|
| 3:35:41| There were a couple things that need to be done that he's addressing but I'd just like to hear from staff and then also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12941)|
| 3:35:49| Am I remembering wrong or if you have a final plot I thought you had to go up or down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12949)|
| 3:35:53| I didn't think you could postpone a final plot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12953)|
| 3:35:57| Yeah, we did look into this if it's not in substantial compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12957)|
| 3:36:02| There is a provision where you can postpone you can postpone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12962)|
| 3:36:06| But if it's related to the traffic study, I would defer to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12966)|
| 3:36:10| Knox County Engineering, is that is that your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12970)|
| 3:36:15| It says that it's not in substantial compliance, so I'm trying to figure out what that means| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12975)|
| 3:36:21| Mr. Reynolds, do you can you speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12981)|
| 3:36:24| I'll just start with the traffic study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12984)|
| 3:36:26| The staff has not had an opportunity to approve the revised traffic study yet, and we're waiting on to hear back from TDOT as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12986)|
| 3:36:33| I'm not so I can't speak to that that part of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=12993)|
| 3:36:41| The the rest of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13001)|
| 3:36:44| So we have a couple other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13004)|
| 3:36:48| Elements we need to discuss they have the stub out to the east| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13008)|
| 3:36:53| So basically what we're seeing is a plat with 80 lots. There are the hatched areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13013)|
| 3:36:59| That do show dashed lot lines where future lots of be they're called future development I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13019)|
| 3:37:08| Can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13028)|
| 3:37:10| You know part of that concern is they're not meeting all the conditions of previous approval by showing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13030)|
| 3:37:15| stub out to the east and also labeling a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13035)|
| 3:37:18| Part of the property as future development that was really look more like a common area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13038)|
| 3:37:25| Those are like little nuance items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13045)|
| 3:37:29| But still a bit concerning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13049)|
| 3:37:37| Let me ask you this Mike if if County Engineering and Public Works feels comfortable with the traffic impact study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13057)|
| 3:37:46| Is that something where you would get that from them prior to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13066)|
| 3:37:51| Signing the plot as he's suggesting or their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13071)|
| 3:37:55| Other like I said, I might have to lean on the name Michelle if you have a more context on this I don't I don't deal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13075)|
| 3:38:01| with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13081)|
| 3:38:02| approval part of plats too often and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13082)|
| 3:38:05| Something comes to the Planning Commission you prove that plot. Is it ready to certify that moment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13085)|
| 3:38:10| That's what I'm not too familiar with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13090)|
| 3:38:13| Do we have that that wiggle room to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13093)|
| 3:38:17| Further refine a plat after the fact from the planning like and once it gets through the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13097)|
| 3:38:24| Yeah, I guess it's a little bit tricky so I guess if this body made a motion that it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13104)|
| 3:38:29| Approvable contingent on engineering's approval of the traffic study. That would be one thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13109)|
| 3:38:34| we would also need to make it contingent upon the other more nuanced housekeeping issues like the label of future development on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13114)|
| 3:38:40| Property that's on the top like plan, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13120)|
| 3:38:42| It's labeled future development. Whereas in the past plan it approved concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13122)|
| 3:38:47| It's open space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13127)|
| 3:38:48| and so one of our concerns was that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13128)|
| 3:38:50| You know with it being labeled this way and approved this way as a final plat that that could potentially be sold and developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13130)|
| 3:38:55| as lots in the future which would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13135)|
| 3:38:56| Then overtake the density that they're allowed to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13136)|
| 3:38:59| So that was a concern that we had and then also the the step out as Mike was saying that middle prong on the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13139)|
| 3:39:06| right side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13146)|
| 3:39:07| Does not extend all the way to the property line. That's based on a fall zone. You can see the circle dashed area of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13147)|
| 3:39:16| telecommunications tower| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13156)|
| 3:39:18| And so we did reach out to our consultant they confirmed that a right-of-way is permissible within that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13158)|
| 3:39:25| So that common area that's dashed there isn't isn't necessarily strictly needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13165)|
| 3:39:28| So we would want to see that stub out continue through that little common area to attach to that adjacent property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13168)|
| 3:39:35| It's another large property. That's well over. I don't know how many acres it is. It's very large| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13175)|
| 3:39:40| So the stub out would provide some additional connectivity because that connects up to another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13180)|
| 3:39:44| Classified road, but it could provide some connectivity in the area. So that was basically our concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13184)|
| 3:39:49| so you could probably condition all of it today, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13189)|
| 3:39:52| That's why we were recommending postponing was to kind of work that out so that we could have a plan that was approvable as is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13192)|
| 3:39:58| Before this body before it came through for certification just that everything was more clear. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13198)|
| 3:40:03| Have absolutely no problem meeting and making it contingent upon meeting all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13203)|
| 3:40:09| Engineering and Public Works requirements as well as meeting all MP staff requirements. I have no problem with that at all and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13209)|
| 3:40:16| So they will not sign the plat until and unless I meet all of their requirements. We can't record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13216)|
| 3:40:23| Without their signature and we cannot record without MPG staff signature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13223)|
| 3:40:28| So they still have control. So I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13228)|
| 3:40:31| Have no problem making a contingent upon those items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13231)|
| 3:40:34| Before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13234)|
| 3:40:36| I go to our commissioners engineering public works looks like they have a comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13236)|
| 3:40:45| The question we would have is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13245)|
| 3:40:48| This plant is 80 lots if TDOT comes back and says he can only plant 64| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13248)|
| 3:40:53| Could then we approve a plant with only 64 lots on it and sign it or would it have to come back before this body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13253)|
| 3:40:59| I'm assuming based on what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13259)|
| 3:41:01| the applicant just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13261)|
| 3:41:04| Articulated is that if you all would not approve the plot as it's submitted that you couldn't sign it and he'd have to go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13264)|
| 3:41:10| And get a revised plot is what it sounds to me like correct. Yes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13270)|
| 3:41:14| Okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13274)|
| 3:41:17| Mr. Higgins were you first I can't believe so my just I think maybe just one question for Mike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13277)|
| 3:41:24| he had mentioned that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13284)|
| 3:41:27| At the applicant had mentioned that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13287)|
| 3:41:29| Previously this could have been staff approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13289)|
| 3:41:33| Before the the state's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13293)|
| 3:41:35| change if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13295)|
| 3:41:37| This had have come before you all and it were able to be staff approved with these changes. Would you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13297)|
| 3:41:43| Approved it or what? Do you have sent back to make those changes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13303)|
| 3:41:51| Yeah, previously it would just would have been a discussion with staff to get the get the plat and to compliance with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13311)|
| 3:41:56| substantial compliance with the concept plan approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13316)|
| 3:41:59| wouldn't have to come to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13319)|
| 3:42:02| the Planning Commission for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13322)|
| 3:42:03| formal approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13323)|
| 3:42:05| I'll piggyback on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13325)|
| 3:42:07| I say I think one of the reasons were the rigs in their work and I can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13327)|
| 3:42:10| Recommending postponement is because we didn't find it's in substantial compliance based on those things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13330)|
| 3:42:14| So if that were still the case we would have had we've had to bring it to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13334)|
| 3:42:18| Anyway, because of that we wouldn't have been able to sign it administratively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13338)|
| 3:42:21| Even if it would have been 25 plus because we wouldn't have been finding that it was in substantial compliance if that makes sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13341)|
| 3:42:26| Yeah, and in that scenario| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13346)|
| 3:42:28| You would have had to bring it to us if they wanted to proceed with it not in substantial compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13348)|
| 3:42:34| If they had have said, okay, we'll change it. Would you have been able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13354)|
| 3:42:38| still approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13358)|
| 3:42:40| We wouldn't have been able to approve it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13360)|
| 3:42:43| They would probably try to ask for variances from some of those things which would have triggered the need to come to you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13363)|
| 3:42:48| gotcha, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13368)|
| 3:42:50| If we are we able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13370)|
| 3:42:53| approve this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13373)|
| 3:42:55| with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13375)|
| 3:42:56| Today with the condition that it's brought to compliance in order to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13376)|
| 3:43:03| proceed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13383)|
| 3:43:05| I think there's the question of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13385)|
| 3:43:07| Previously approved concept plan. So if you guys wanted to approve it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13387)|
| 3:43:11| Based on the reasons that are not in compliance to make conditions to bring it into compliance with that then would not need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13391)|
| 3:43:18| Then you would be able to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13398)|
| 3:43:20| If you wanted to approve it as is and a revised concept plan would be needed and that's the part that could be approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13400)|
| 3:43:25| Administratively by staff. So if we approved it as is they would need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13405)|
| 3:43:30| Redo the concept plan and I assume that would probably slow them down even more than the third a 30-day postponement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13410)|
| 3:43:39| Not necessarily because it's administrative so it wouldn't have to come to you guys, but they we would need a revised plan showing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13419)|
| 3:43:45| You know, whatever whatever you guys approved here. That's not in compliance with what was approved before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13425)|
| 3:43:50| And I apologize because I the term substantial compliance is a little bit conflicting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13430)|
| 3:43:55| I mean the original concept plan was approved for 90 lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13435)|
| 3:44:01| We are in the roads haven't changed at all the pro profiles haven't changed the size of the lots hadn't changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13441)|
| 3:44:08| Nothing has changed. The only thing that has changed is the threshold by which we can plot 66 lots or plot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13448)|
| 3:44:16| 80 lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13456)|
| 3:44:18| The concept plan that was approved was 90 lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13458)|
| 3:44:23| There's only one variable that's changed through this process is the change in how they analyze traffic now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13463)|
| 3:44:29| And that has been amended one quick question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13469)|
| 3:44:32| Are you aware of the three or four comments that staff has written though that that on the concept plan that you're speaking of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13472)|
| 3:44:37| There were some stub roads and some things that yes, right and and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13477)|
| 3:44:41| Yes, and we're agreeable. Okay, we're okay with that. We can go back to staff and work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13481)|
| 3:44:46| What| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13486)|
| 3:44:47| so you would modify the final plot to to include these three items that staff has pointed out that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13487)|
| 3:44:55| Different than the originally approved concept plan in order to get the 80 approved if T dot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13495)|
| 3:45:01| Agrees with the traffic study. That's correct. Yes, sir. Okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13501)|
| 3:45:05| Commissioner Adams, no, mr. Huber| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13505)|
| 3:45:12| So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13512)|
| 3:45:13| the term final plat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13513)|
| 3:45:16| How can we approve a plat as a final plat if we're not looking at the final plat?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13516)|
| 3:45:23| Like can it really be a conditional approval of something? That's actually not final like wouldn't it wouldn't the state could be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13523)|
| 3:45:31| The reason they want us to look at it is it is the final version that will be recorded, right? Otherwise, we're really just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13531)|
| 3:45:37| Talking about it. I mean and I know this isn't a concept plan submission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13537)|
| 3:45:41| but this is we're just playing concept plan revision right now and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13541)|
| 3:45:45| Hoping that it can be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13545)|
| 3:45:47| administratively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13547)|
| 3:45:49| Signed off on it, right like that's that's where I'm and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13549)|
| 3:45:53| There are it's not just one thing here. We've got like three or four. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13553)|
| 3:45:59| You know, I know time is money, but this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13559)|
| 3:46:05| The future development labeling is also a little concerning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13565)|
| 3:46:10| So, I mean, I think we should just postpone it instead of trying to answer on how we can make this work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13570)|
| 3:46:16| And see it next month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13576)|
| 3:46:20| So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13580)|
| 3:46:22| You know pending confirmation maybe from Council on this I'd make the motion to postpone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13582)|
| 3:46:39| I do have some concerns Commissioner Schelso as Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13599)|
| 3:46:44| the bylaws of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13604)|
| 3:46:47| the Planning Commission say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13607)|
| 3:46:49| With regard to it's in section 10 concerning postponement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13609)|
| 3:46:54| that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13614)|
| 3:46:55| Any matter appearing on the Commission's agenda can be postponed to a subsequent meeting upon a majority vote of the Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13615)|
| 3:47:01| But there's a carve-out there provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13621)|
| 3:47:04| However, any application for final subdivision plat approval may not be postponed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13624)|
| 3:47:10| Without the concurrence and consent of the applicant. So the applicant can certainly consent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13630)|
| 3:47:17| To a postponement, but my concern is that if the applicant does not consent to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13637)|
| 3:47:23| that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13643)|
| 3:47:24| That is not at this point the Commission's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13644)|
| 3:47:28| Option without consent of postponement is you vote it up or you vote it down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13648)|
| 3:47:32| And my other part of the concern is is it a final like are we we're not really approving a final plat?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13652)|
| 3:47:39| I think that's the origin of that rule. I mean, I think that's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13659)|
| 3:47:44| That's right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13664)|
| 3:47:46| As you all probably aware plats are changed and amended many times after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13666)|
| 3:47:51| Excuse me at this point. I'm gonna have to ask that we limit the applicants comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13671)|
| 3:47:58| Yes, we're at the point now for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13678)|
| 3:48:00| Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13680)|
| 3:48:02| discussion, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13682)|
| 3:48:03| If you don't mind you feel free to take a seat where you'd be more comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13683)|
| 3:48:06| And if there's a question that's asked to you directly by Commissioner, then of course, we'd ask you to come back up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13686)|
| 3:48:11| But right now it's appropriate for Commission discussion. Yes, ma'am. I think it's no no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13691)|
| 3:48:16| My apologies and part of my concern is if we approve this with these conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13696)|
| 3:48:21| Like could a neighbor who doesn't like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13701)|
| 3:48:24| file a suit and say well the Planning Commission never actually approved the final plat like it's it's partially out of concern about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13704)|
| 3:48:29| The legitimacy of the plat. I think that's right. I think you want finality because it's called final. That's right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13709)|
| 3:48:36| and so that that's why I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13716)|
| 3:48:40| Would I guess implore the consent to postpone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13720)|
| 3:48:47| Commissioner Adams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13727)|
| 3:48:49| Just to make sure I'm tracking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13729)|
| 3:48:51| we have the option of the applicant accepting the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13731)|
| 3:48:57| recommendation of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13737)|
| 3:48:58| postponement or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13738)|
| 3:49:00| We have to vote up or down on what is in front of us today. That's what I thought originally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13740)|
| 3:49:04| Yes, that is my interpretation of the bylaws. Yes. Okay, so I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13744)|
| 3:49:09| second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13749)|
| 3:49:11| Commissioner Schultz's move to postpone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13751)|
| 3:49:14| With the consent of the applicant then in that case it would be appropriate at this point now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13754)|
| 3:49:21| It is your turn to speak. Mr. Applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13761)|
| 3:49:24| There is a motion and a second to postpone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13764)|
| 3:49:28| Is that a postponement for 30 days? Is that the motion that you've made?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13768)|
| 3:49:32| Okay, so there's a postponement for 30 days or to the next to the next meeting of this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13772)|
| 3:49:38| We will need to know before the Commission votes if you agree to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13778)|
| 3:49:44| Or you do not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13784)|
| 3:49:45| Well for clarification purposes, and I apologize. I wasn't trying to be rude. I wasn't trying to speak out of hand earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13785)|
| 3:49:54| We have millions of dollars invested here and so and I understand all that but it's okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13794)|
| 3:49:58| I'll answer your question. I really just need a yes or no, and then I can strike the board appropriately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13798)|
| 3:50:03| No, ma'am. I have a question and I need clarification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13803)|
| 3:50:06| Okay, if it is denied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13806)|
| 3:50:08| Let's just say it goes to the vote to deny the plot. What are the steps beyond that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13808)|
| 3:50:14| When can you come back and reapply? What is the steps? I'm sorry. You would you would need to reapply. That's correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13814)|
| 3:50:20| Well in some issues you have to wait a year. Do you have to wait a year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13820)|
| 3:50:23| You have to wait 30 days. When can you reapply for a plot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13823)|
| 3:50:31| I believe that you could read you could resubmit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13831)|
| 3:50:34| a plot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13834)|
| 3:50:35| But do you have to do it 45 days before the meeting? So this wouldn't be heard until December. That's correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13835)|
| 3:50:41| And what I mean, so I I'm sorry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13841)|
| 3:50:47| And in all due respect to this body, I don't I'm still not understanding and I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13847)|
| 3:50:52| You told me I have to give you a yes or no answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13852)|
| 3:50:55| But it's hard to do so without knowing and understanding what your rules are because there's some some ambiguity in the rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13855)|
| 3:51:01| But it sounds like and we're gonna close this and go to a vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13861)|
| 3:51:05| But it sounds like if you do not want to postpone it 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13865)|
| 3:51:09| That would ensure that you would get back on the agenda in November| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13869)|
| 3:51:12| If you're gonna change everything that you said staff asked for you to apparently it's going to be approved in November| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13872)|
| 3:51:18| With with TDOT and Highway Department's approval. You'd be approved in November| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13878)|
| 3:51:23| It sounds like if if if it's staff recommendation if we vote on it and we're gonna check that timing just to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13883)|
| 3:51:30| Yes, if not, I do want you to have a clear understanding of the timing if not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13890)|
| 3:51:35| Then it sounds like we have a motion that we need to deal with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13895)|
| 3:51:38| I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13898)|
| 3:51:49| Just want to clarify for myself, I know you just said it but I was debating something else and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13909)|
| 3:51:55| If it is postponed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13915)|
| 3:51:58| That would be a 30-day postponement. So that would mean November| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13918)|
| 3:52:02| That would mean November and if he is going to accept the staff comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13922)|
| 3:52:09| That he was going to make the final plot mirror. What was approved on the original concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13929)|
| 3:52:15| And if the traffic study is okay to the satisfaction of the Highway Department in TDOT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13935)|
| 3:52:19| Then I'm I would assume that staff would come back in November with a positive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13939)|
| 3:52:23| Recommendation because it meets the merits of the approved concept plan and we could approve or deal with it at that time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13943)|
| 3:52:29| but if it is if it goes to a vote for up or down on the plat and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13949)|
| 3:52:33| He chooses to and it is denied and he reapplies then the time period for that would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13953)|
| 3:52:40| Hey, it's not one year. So I'll read from the bylaws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13960)|
| 3:52:43| so if the Commission votes to deny any application for rezoning use on review special use or one-year plan amendment a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13963)|
| 3:52:48| New application for the same proposal shall not be accepted by the staff for a period of one year. So that does not include final| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13968)|
| 3:52:53| plats| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13973)|
| 3:52:55| But does it mean the 45 day or the December?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13975)|
| 3:52:59| Yes, the standard yes, what would the deadline be staff at this point? I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13979)|
| 3:53:08| Don't know the deadline I'll talk my head off to look that up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=13988)|
