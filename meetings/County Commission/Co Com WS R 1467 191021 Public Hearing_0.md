| 0:00:40| This is a special hearing, the purpose of which is to interview all of the applicants who have expressed an interest in joining the Knox County Ethics Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=40)|
| 0:00:52| Here's how it's going to work tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=52)|
| 0:00:55| At the beginning of the meeting, I'm going to, in just a second, I'm going to ask the clerk's office to call roll to verify all the commissioners who are actually present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=55)|
| 0:01:02| Then we are going to ask each one of the folks who have expressed an interest to come forward to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=62)|
| 0:01:10| You may feel comfortable if you need to, you may want to adjust the microphone, state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=70)|
| 0:01:18| and then you have five minutes to make a statement about why you think that you would be the best representative to serve in this volunteer and very important capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=78)|
| 0:01:29| Some of the commissioners may have some questions for you at that time, but I also want to be clear that no votes are going to be taken tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=89)|
| 0:01:36| This is really more of an informational meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=96)|
| 0:01:39| Yes, Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=99)|
| 0:01:41| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=101)|
| 0:01:42| I was just going to ask you, is there any way to give them direction on how to raise or lower the podium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=102)|
| 0:01:48| Just in case someone might.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=108)|
| 0:01:50| Yeah, there is a button.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=110)|
| 0:01:51| I just wanted them to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=111)|
| 0:01:53| Yeah, if you feel like the podium is blocking you, there is a button on the side that you can push and raise it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=113)|
| 0:01:58| Hey, Commissioner Biggs, since you're close down there, can you kind of go down and show it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=118)|
| 0:02:03| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=123)|
| 0:02:07| Always, when you're the guy that brings it up, you're going to be asked to be the one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=127)|
| 0:02:16| It's not hooked up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=136)|

| 0:02:55| Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=175)|
| 0:02:56| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=176)|
| 0:02:57| Commissioner Biggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=177)|
| 0:02:58| Present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=178)|
| 0:02:59| All members present and accounted for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=179)|
| 0:03:00| And, Mr. Chairman, our seats with the microphones are also on, so that will give people an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=180)|
| 0:03:02| Sure, that could work as an option quite as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=182)|
| 0:03:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=184)|
| 0:03:06| I guess you can see me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=186)|
| 0:03:07| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=187)|
| 0:03:08| I'm Virginia Anagnost, A-N-A-G-N-O-S-T.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=188)|
| 0:03:09| I live at 7609 Twining Drive in West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=189)|
| 0:03:10| Is there anything else you asked?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=190)|
| 0:03:11| I think that was it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=191)|
| 0:03:12| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=192)|
| 0:03:13| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=193)|
| 0:03:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=194)|
| 0:03:15| I guess that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=195)|
| 0:03:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=196)|
| 0:03:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=197)|
| 0:03:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=198)|
| 0:03:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=199)|
| 0:03:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=200)|
| 0:03:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=201)|
| 0:03:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=202)|
| 0:03:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=203)|
| 0:03:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=204)|
| 0:03:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=205)|
| 0:03:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=206)|
| 0:03:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=207)|
| 0:03:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=208)|
| 0:03:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=209)|
| 0:03:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=210)|
| 0:03:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=211)|
| 0:03:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=212)|
| 0:03:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=213)|
| 0:03:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=214)|
| 0:03:35| I can answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=215)|
| 0:03:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=216)|
| 0:03:37| And Miss Anagnost, if you could take just a few minutes to say what motivated you to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=217)|
| 0:03:41| apply for this role and why you think you'd be a good person to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=221)|
| 0:03:46| Well, I have served as a volunteer in a county agency, the Knoxville-Knox County Community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=226)|
| 0:03:56| Action Committee for more years than I'd like to say, over 30 years, as chair over 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=236)|
| 0:04:07| And it's been my privilege to do that. It's a multi-faceted agency, as you well know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=247)|
| 0:04:16| Commissioner Bussler is on our, by your direction, is on our board. And I've been on so long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=256)|
| 0:04:25| that I'm almost embarrassed to say how long I've been on. I have tried a number of times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=265)|
| 0:04:31| to step down. We have good board members. However, the director has asked me repeatedly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=271)|
| 0:04:41| to please stay on because it is a multi-faceted agency. But having said that, I've also been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=281)|
| 0:04:51| as you see from my VEDA, I think you've all gotten a copy of my resume. I've been an assistant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=291)|
| 0:04:57| dean at the University of Tennessee for 10 years. I was on the faculty for about 25 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=297)|
| 0:05:09| And I was the director of the National Conference for Community and Justice, which previously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=309)|
| 0:05:15| had been the National Conference of Christians and Jews. And that is an agency, not an agency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=315)|
| 0:05:22| but an organization that dated back to, oh, the time of the 1920s when there was a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=322)|
| 0:05:29| of controversy here in the United States about religious, particularly at that time, about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=329)|
| 0:05:36| religious conflicts. A Roman Catholic was running for the office of presidency and it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=336)|
| 0:05:41| caused a lot of turmoil. He was the first to do that, Candidate Smith at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=341)|
| 0:05:49| And NCCJ came into existence. So for many years, I have worked about 18, 19 years as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=349)|
| 0:05:56| a director of that agency, and I'm accustomed to working across the religious, racial, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=356)|
| 0:06:00| ethnic lines of our community. I'm sorry that NCCJ, after all this time, a good number of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=360)|
| 0:06:08| years after I retired, kind of phased out at the national level. Unfortunately, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=368)|
| 0:06:16| we need them more today than ever before. There's so much controversy and so much turmoil| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=376)|
| 0:06:21| in our nation. And thank goodness it hasn't hit our community all that much. We live in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=381)|
| 0:06:29| harmony for the most part, but we may have differences of opinion. We manage to surmount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=389)|
| 0:06:36| those and keep going. But with my experience, I thought that this would be a good opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=396)|
| 0:06:42| to further serve Knox County, and that motivated me to go ahead and apply when I saw that there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=402)|
| 0:06:50| were a couple of vacancies. So essentially, that's it. That's my background. I know a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=410)|
| 0:06:57| number of you personally, and you've always encouraged me to keep going, and so I keep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=417)|
| 0:07:04| going. And it would be my privilege to serve if that opportunity arises. So, anything you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=424)|
| 0:07:13| would like to ask me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=433)|
| 0:07:15| Let's see. The chair acknowledges two lights. Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=435)|
| 0:07:20| Jay. Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=440)|
| 0:07:23| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ms. Virginia, do you have any family members that are current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=443)|
| 0:07:29| Knox County employees, or any departments of Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=449)|
| 0:07:33| No, and I'm not a paid board member of CAC or paid head of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=453)|
| 0:07:43| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=463)|
| 0:07:45| Okay, Commissioner Biggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=465)|
| 0:07:47| Commissioner Biggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=467)|
| 0:07:48| Yeah, thank you for your time. Do you have any contracts or business with Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=468)|
| 0:07:53| No, I have no business whatsoever, except I'm a taxpayer. What else? I do pay my taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=473)|
| 0:08:03| so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=483)|
| 0:08:04| All right. Next, Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=484)|
| 0:08:07| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ms. Virginia, two questions. First question is, do you use social| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=487)|
| 0:08:14| media, Facebook?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=494)|
| 0:08:16| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=496)|
| 0:08:17| Good. I'll ask this to everybody. These will be my two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=497)|
| 0:08:22| I didn't expect that response from you when I said that. I said it with some chagrin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=502)|
| 0:08:28| Well, we had an appointment at one time, and it kind of made me mad that when I looked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=508)|
| 0:08:35| at his Facebook post, he was saying bad things about a certain commissioner. So, really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=515)|
| 0:08:42| it would not be wise, if you're on the Ethics Committee, anyone to use Facebook to downgrade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=522)|
| 0:08:48| anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=528)|
| 0:08:49| Second question is that the Ethics Committee seems like it's turned into a political witch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=529)|
| 0:08:57| hunt. It's not really being used for the last couple of times for what it's really set up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=537)|
| 0:09:05| for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=545)|
| 0:09:06| Who is? What group is that, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=546)|
| 0:09:11| In the past year, Commissioner Busler and Commissioner Thomas were brought before the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=551)|
| 0:09:15| Ethics Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=555)|
| 0:09:16| I remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=556)|
| 0:09:17| And so was Commissioner Andrews brought forth. Well, he didn't come, but he was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=557)|
| 0:09:22| That's what happens when you pay golf, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=562)|
| 0:09:27| But part of that is that the law director investigated. The law director's investigator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=567)|
| 0:09:44| said that there was no standing and no finding, but there was enough votes to send it forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=584)|
| 0:09:52| anyway. And if you cannot listen to an investigator and the law department that says that there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=592)|
| 0:09:59| no finding or no standing there and you still vote, my question is, will you be fair and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=599)|
| 0:10:06| will you listen to all the evidence?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=606)|
| 0:10:09| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=609)|
| 0:10:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=610)|
| 0:10:11| Those of you who know me know that I work very much above the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=611)|
| 0:10:16| All right. Thank you. Thank you. Commissioner Busler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=616)|
| 0:10:19| Thank you, Mr. Chair. Virginia, I tell you what, next board meeting I'm going to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=619)|
| 0:10:23| to say something about you at the board meeting. No, I'm just teasing you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=623)|
| 0:10:27| It's coming up Thursday. Better be there, Charlie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=627)|
| 0:10:32| That's the big joke in my district. Everybody says something about my golf playing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=632)|
| 0:10:37| Let me ask you this one question. Have you had an opportunity to look at the Ethics Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=637)|
| 0:10:42| guidelines in their booklet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=642)|
| 0:10:45| No, I haven't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=645)|
| 0:10:48| Might want to do that because there's a lot of responsibilities that you have in the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=648)|
| 0:10:53| the meetings are called also, so might want to look at that also. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=653)|
| 0:10:58| Okay. Thank you for your advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=658)|
| 0:11:00| Okay. Thank you. Coming back to Commissioner Biggs, I think you'd ask the first question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=660)|
| 0:11:03| but is your light still on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=663)|
| 0:11:05| Pardon me. I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=665)|
| 0:11:06| All right. Thank you. All right. Ms. Daniels, I think that's got it. You still actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=666)|
| 0:11:10| have a minute left on your time, but I don't think you've got anything else to say unless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=670)|
| 0:11:14| you'd like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=674)|
| 0:11:15| No questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=675)|
| 0:11:16| Okay. All right. Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=676)|
| 0:11:17| Thank you. Thank you for the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=677)|
| 0:11:22| Okay. Next on the list is Perry Beal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=682)|
| 0:11:26| Good evening, Mr. Beal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=686)|
| 0:11:47| It's Perry Beal, 5267 Fountainhead Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=707)|
| 0:11:53| Okay. Go ahead, Mr. Beal. The floor is yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=713)|
| 0:11:56| Okay. I've been a realtor, and one of the things that during the time I was a realtor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=716)|
| 0:12:05| I had the obligation to have fiduciary responsibility to all of my clients, and as such, what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=725)|
| 0:12:14| one of the core founding positions for a realtor is to have fiduciary responsibility. Also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=734)|
| 0:12:24| as a, and I think you saw my resume that I also am a pilot, and one of the parts of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=744)|
| 0:12:34| being a commercial pilot is also having a high degree of ethics. Matter of fact, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=754)|
| 0:12:39| train on ethics every two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=759)|
| 0:12:42| So other than that, you know, I'm active here in town, but other than that, I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=762)|
| 0:12:53| have a lot of extra to share with you. Other than that, I've owned a business, actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=773)|
| 0:13:00| several businesses, with pretty good staff. But that's me. I'm not overly spoken, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=780)|
| 0:13:12| if you'll find me thinking things through well, so that's just my nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=792)|
| 0:13:19| Okay. Thank you. Any additional statements, Mr. Beal? Okay. Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=799)|
| 0:13:27| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The at-large commissioner is going to combine their questions into one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=807)|
| 0:13:32| Do you have any relatives that are employees or contractors or are doing any business with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=812)|
| 0:13:37| Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=817)|
| 0:13:38| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=818)|
| 0:13:39| Thank you very much. Okay. Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=819)|
| 0:13:44| Same questions as before. Do you use social media?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=824)|
| 0:13:49| I do not write anything on social media. Do I go there to find information? Occasionally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=829)|
| 0:14:00| I'll look at it, but I'm a firm believer that I stay clear of it. It's gotten to be so convoluted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=840)|
| 0:14:09| that I just stay clear of it. So if somebody posts something on it, I'll read it, but that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=849)|
| 0:14:14| as far as it goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=854)|
| 0:14:16| Yeah. I mean, there's nothing wrong with using social media, but it's got to be positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=856)|
| 0:14:20| I don't get involved. I just don't get involved either way, negative or positive. I just don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=860)|
| 0:14:25| get involved. I just use it as a backdrop to see what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=865)|
| 0:14:29| Thank you very much. And the second question was about being objective when the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=869)|
| 0:14:38| hires an investigator and the investigator comes back and says there's nothing there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=878)|
| 0:14:43| and they said there's no standing. Will you be able to make an informed, conscientious decision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=883)|
| 0:14:54| Yes. As a matter of fact, one of the things I do as a pilot is you have to take all the facts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=894)|
| 0:15:00| into consideration and then make a logical deduction based on what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=900)|
| 0:15:07| And that's just my nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=907)|
| 0:15:12| Save a little time if the other candidates would answer these questions. You won't have to hear me, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=912)|
| 0:15:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=918)|
| 0:15:19| All right. Thank you. Commissioner Bussler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=919)|
| 0:15:22| Yes. Mr. Field, have you had an opportunity to look at the manual form?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=922)|
| 0:15:27| No. No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=927)|
| 0:15:29| Okay. It gives you guidelines. I suggest you should look at that thing. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=929)|
| 0:15:36| All right. Commissioner Skinmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=936)|
| 0:15:38| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. On your resume, I noticed that one of your goals was to own a Mooney aircraft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=938)|
| 0:15:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=945)|
| 0:15:46| Is that the same aircraft that Harrison Ford has one as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=946)|
| 0:15:50| Not a Mooney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=950)|
| 0:15:51| Not a Mooney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=951)|
| 0:15:52| Not the one that crashed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=952)|
| 0:15:53| No. As a matter of fact, he has several. I don't know if he's flying any of them at this time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=953)|
| 0:15:59| after he almost landed on a taxiway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=959)|
| 0:16:02| Yeah, but that was a couple of years ago. So he's still good, yeah. Okay. But do you fly that a lot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=962)|
| 0:16:07| The Mooney?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=967)|
| 0:16:08| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=968)|
| 0:16:09| Right now I haven't acquired it yet, so I can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=969)|
| 0:16:12| Oh, okay. You're still on. Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=972)|
| 0:16:15| But I'm looking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=975)|
| 0:16:16| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=976)|
| 0:16:17| All right. Very good. Any additional questions, my fellow commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=977)|
| 0:16:21| All right. Thank you, Mr. Beal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=981)|
| 0:16:27| All right. Next is Mr. Hardwig.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=987)|
| 0:16:35| Yeah, that's in order. Yeah, John Hardwig.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=995)|
| 0:16:37| If you could just step forward and please state your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=997)|
| 0:16:42| My name is John Hardwig, and my address is 810 Oak Grove Lane in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1002)|
| 0:16:50| I do not use social media.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1010)|
| 0:16:53| You'll have to restate your other question again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1013)|
| 0:17:01| I don't know whether I'm the best person for this job or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1021)|
| 0:17:03| That's your call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1023)|
| 0:17:05| So what I want to do is tell you what I think I've learned from serving on ethics committees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1025)|
| 0:17:11| and serving as a consultant to ethics committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1031)|
| 0:17:14| I have worked with or on ethics committees for the last 25 years, four different ethics committees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1034)|
| 0:17:21| and they have taught me great respect for ethical discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1041)|
| 0:17:28| I want to explain that a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1048)|
| 0:17:30| Now, a county ethics committee is different from a hospital ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1050)|
| 0:17:34| I understand that, and that's part of the reason I'm interested in serving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1054)|
| 0:17:38| I'm going to learn something about an ethics committee in a different context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1058)|
| 0:17:42| I don't think we're going to vote to pull the plug on anybody at the county ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1062)|
| 0:17:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1069)|
| 0:17:51| We come to an ethics committee meeting when the ethics committee is working properly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1071)|
| 0:17:56| and most of them have most of the time in my experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1076)|
| 0:18:00| with humility and recognizing that we don't have all the answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1080)|
| 0:18:04| We come with our own convictions and our own opinions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1084)|
| 0:18:07| but we recognize that other people come with different convictions and different opinions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1087)|
| 0:18:12| and we have to be open to learning from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1092)|
| 0:18:16| So what we try to do is listen carefully and respectfully to other people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1096)|
| 0:18:23| explain why we don't agree with that initially at least,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1103)|
| 0:18:27| and hopefully work toward some kind of position that we can agree on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1107)|
| 0:18:34| Ethics committees that I've served on don't like to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1114)|
| 0:18:39| Because voting is too superficial, we try to arrive at a consensus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1119)|
| 0:18:44| If you can arrive at a consensus, maybe not unanimity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1124)|
| 0:18:47| but if you can arrive at a consensus, that's the goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1127)|
| 0:18:50| And we arrive there by various members of the committee recognizing that this is a better idea than they came in with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1130)|
| 0:19:01| But consensus is not always forthcoming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1141)|
| 0:19:05| When consensus cannot be reached, agreement cannot be reached,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1145)|
| 0:19:09| then what you have to do is something a little different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1149)|
| 0:19:12| And that's where my experience, I've served for five or six years as a volunteer mediator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1152)|
| 0:19:19| for a community mediation center here in Knoxville, mostly with the family courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1159)|
| 0:19:29| An ethics committee does not do mediation, but what a mediator does, unlike an arbitrator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1169)|
| 0:19:36| a mediator has no power to craft a decision and certainly no power to make a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1176)|
| 0:19:42| All a mediator can do is guide the discussion, facilitate the discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1182)|
| 0:19:48| and try to move the disputants closer together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1188)|
| 0:19:52| And that is a very valuable skill I've found on ethics committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1192)|
| 0:19:58| So sometimes what you do is you do sort of mediation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1198)|
| 0:20:04| Another thing you do is compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1204)|
| 0:20:06| You compromise in light of the very strong convictions of some individual committee members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1206)|
| 0:20:14| You compromise also in light of what you know your ability to, let's see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1214)|
| 0:20:24| your purview is, your ability to be efficacious is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1224)|
| 0:20:27| There's no point sending forth a recommendation from an ethics committee that's dead on arrival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1227)|
| 0:20:32| All that does is serve to disempower the ethics committee on down the line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1232)|
| 0:20:40| in the eyes of the people who are empowered to make the decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1240)|
| 0:20:43| Knox County does not have government by ethics committee, and that's almost certainly a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1243)|
| 0:20:51| So all the ethics committee can do is make a recommendation to somebody else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1251)|
| 0:20:56| and there's no point in making a recommendation that has no credibility at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1256)|
| 0:21:02| in the people who must receive it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1262)|
| 0:21:04| Finally, what I've learned is that ethics cases and ethics decisions are not separate items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1264)|
| 0:21:13| They go forward, and an ethics committee has to be looking into the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1273)|
| 0:21:19| First of all, an ethics committee decision is never the end of the matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1279)|
| 0:21:26| Somebody's going to have to live with whatever the recommendation is if the recommendation is accepted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1286)|
| 0:21:32| We're also going to all have to work together as members of an ethics committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1292)|
| 0:21:37| as parts of Knox County government, and most basically as citizens living together in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1297)|
| 0:21:45| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1305)|
| 0:21:47| Thank you. Is there any additional questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1307)|
| 0:21:50| I know you'd mentioned one of the, yeah, Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1310)|
| 0:21:54| I'll follow up on mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1314)|
| 0:21:56| This ethics committee is a committee that someone brings a complaint against an associate of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1316)|
| 0:22:05| and your decision will be if they're found guilty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1325)|
| 0:22:09| your recommendation will be moved on to the district attorney for prosecution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1329)|
| 0:22:13| That's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1333)|
| 0:22:15| That is very serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1335)|
| 0:22:17| Not only that, it's the reputation of that person that has come,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1337)|
| 0:22:22| and that's the difference in between just, say, an ethics committee to where you make up rules or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1342)|
| 0:22:29| You're going to be a judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1349)|
| 0:22:31| You will be a judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1351)|
| 0:22:33| You're judging someone's life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1353)|
| 0:22:35| That's how important this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1355)|
| 0:22:37| It is important, and I agree that's different from an ethics committee in the hospitals I've worked at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1357)|
| 0:22:43| because the ethics committee is not empowered to make a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1363)|
| 0:22:48| All the ethics committees that I've served on can do is send it upstairs to somebody to make a decision on the basis of our recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1368)|
| 0:22:56| That's an important difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1376)|
| 0:22:58| I grant you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1378)|
| 0:22:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1379)|
| 0:23:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1380)|
| 0:23:01| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1381)|
| 0:23:02| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1382)|
| 0:23:03| Mr. Hardwig, do you have any relatives that are employees of Knox County or contracts with Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1383)|
| 0:23:09| I do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1389)|
| 0:23:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1390)|
| 0:23:11| Thank you very much, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1391)|
| 0:23:12| I was supposed to answer that before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1392)|
| 0:23:13| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1393)|
| 0:23:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1394)|
| 0:23:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1395)|
| 0:23:16| We'll remember that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1396)|
| 0:23:17| Mine is going to be the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1397)|
| 0:23:18| Have you taken a look at the ethics manual when you applied?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1398)|
| 0:23:22| I thought it would be time enough to do that if I were selected, but I agree that's a really important thing to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1402)|
| 0:23:28| and I will have it reviewed before the first meeting if I'm selected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1408)|
| 0:23:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1412)|
| 0:23:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1413)|
| 0:23:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1414)|
| 0:23:35| Any additional questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1415)|
| 0:23:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1416)|
| 0:23:37| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1417)|
| 0:23:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1418)|
| 0:23:42| Mr. Jason Johansen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1422)|
| 0:23:53| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1433)|
| 0:23:54| My name is Jason Johansen, J-O-H-A-N-S-E-N.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1434)|
| 0:23:59| I live at 250 East Anderson Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1439)|
| 0:24:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1444)|
| 0:24:05| The floor is yours, Jason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1445)|
| 0:24:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1446)|
| 0:24:07| I'm thankful for the opportunity to introduce myself to those present, to you good people who serve the good people of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1447)|
| 0:24:15| My name is Jason Johansen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1455)|
| 0:24:17| I've lived in Knoxville about 11 years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1457)|
| 0:24:19| I'm a pastor at Grace and Peace Church here in Knoxville, a father of five children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1459)|
| 0:24:25| I hold two master's degrees from Western Seminary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1465)|
| 0:24:27| I've taken numerous courses concerned with ethics, both at the graduate and undergraduate level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1467)|
| 0:24:33| I taught an undergraduate course in ethics as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1473)|
| 0:24:37| The training, I'm not sure how useful it is in this capacity, but if nothing else, it taught me the difference between asserting my own ethics and upholding the ethical guidelines that a particular group has been bound to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1477)|
| 0:24:52| which I believe is the responsibility of the Ethics Committee in this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1492)|
| 0:24:58| However, I believe the most important contribution I would contribute to this Ethics Committee have been gained outside of the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1498)|
| 0:25:06| I've served in pastoral ministry for more than 13 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1506)|
| 0:25:09| For the last nine, at Grace and Peace, as I mentioned, that's more than 13 years of cooperating and working on a committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1509)|
| 0:25:17| which I suspect this commission knows it takes a certain temperament and disposition to do that well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1517)|
| 0:25:23| Whatever the case, that's 13 years of doing that in at least a church setting where I've had to work with committees in order to accomplish anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1523)|
| 0:25:31| I'm pleased to – I recommend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1531)|
| 0:25:34| I'm happy to have had the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1534)|
| 0:25:36| Besides being a pastor, my wife and I served as foster parents here in Knoxville until we adopted our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1536)|
| 0:25:44| I tell you this just to let you know that even though I have very little experience in the public sphere of government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1544)|
| 0:25:54| I do have a great deal of experience working with folks who are affected by the work that you folks do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1554)|
| 0:26:01| As a pastor and a foster parent, I've had the opportunity to work with and meet very influential, well-off, and well-educated citizens of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1561)|
| 0:26:11| I've also had the great pleasure to serve some of the least fortunate, least educated, and least powerful people in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1571)|
| 0:26:17| And my interaction with both groups has shown me just how essential and important the work of the county government is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1577)|
| 0:26:23| So given how important your work is, I do think it is absolutely appropriate and healthy for there to be a code of ethics for all those who work as public servants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1583)|
| 0:26:33| And if the ladies and gentlemen of this commission see fit, I would be honored to serve on the Ethics Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1593)|
| 0:26:39| and contribute to the good work you do upholding those ethical standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1599)|
| 0:26:44| And as to your questions, no, I don't have – nobody in my family works for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1604)|
| 0:26:52| Yes, I believe I would be able to make reasonable and responsible decisions that take into account the consequences of those decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1612)|
| 0:27:06| I have had the opportunity to read through the Ethical Code of Conduct, and I do think, again, my experience with a good swath of folks around Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1626)|
| 0:27:16| gives me the capacity to understand what a reasonable – a normal, reasonable interpretation of those things would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1636)|
| 0:27:24| Were there any other preliminary questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1644)|
| 0:27:28| Thank you. Do you have any contracts with the county or do business with Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1648)|
| 0:27:32| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1652)|
| 0:27:35| All right, Commissioner Bessel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1655)|
| 0:27:36| Thank you. You said that you saw or looked at the Code of Conduct for Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1656)|
| 0:27:42| I did look at that. I've not seen any handbook as far as that goes, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1662)|
| 0:27:46| Okay, there is a handbook with it anyway. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1666)|
| 0:27:48| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1668)|
| 0:27:50| All right, thank you. Any additional questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1670)|
| 0:27:52| All right, thank you so much for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1672)|
| 0:27:54| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1674)|
| 0:27:58| Okay, Mr. Corey Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1678)|
| 0:28:12| Hello, I'm Mr. Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1692)|
| 0:28:13| Corey Johnson, 206 Gayview Drive, Apartment 60 in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1693)|
| 0:28:21| I currently do not have any contracts with Knox County. I don't have any family that works for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1701)|
| 0:28:26| I read over a little bit of the handbook earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1706)|
| 0:28:30| I do use social media for looking, a good laugh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1710)|
| 0:28:34| I don't post against people because what's the point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1714)|
| 0:28:39| And I do believe I could make an unbiased opinion if I need to make an unbiased opinion against anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1719)|
| 0:28:46| I've spent years as a fraud investigator for a bank as well as an incident manager,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1726)|
| 0:28:52| so I do have the knowledge and the know-how to actually make these decisions if need be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1732)|
| 0:29:01| I mean, it's the difference between someone's livelihood or sending someone to prison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1741)|
| 0:29:06| That's what I did, and that's what I still currently do at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1746)|
| 0:29:10| I believe in the facts, and I believe in letting people speak to hear what they actually have to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1750)|
| 0:29:17| before making an informed decision against what the facts actually are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1757)|
| 0:29:24| Okay. Any additional comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1764)|
| 0:29:27| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1767)|
| 0:29:28| Okay. Commissioner Bussler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1768)|
| 0:29:30| Thank you, Mr. Chair. You said that you've looked at the ethical handbook that we have here in Knox County, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1770)|
| 0:29:37| I did have a glance at it on the website, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1777)|
| 0:29:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1779)|
| 0:29:41| What do you think your responsibility is in litigating an ethical complaint?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1781)|
| 0:29:51| It's to make sure it's valid and make sure it can actually hold up to what we believe is correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1791)|
| 0:29:59| as well as what that person believes is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1799)|
| 0:30:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1803)|
| 0:30:04| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1804)|
| 0:30:06| All right. Thank you. Any additional questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1806)|
| 0:30:08| Mr. Chair, thank you for volunteering to Mayor Glenn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1808)|
| 0:30:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1813)|
| 0:30:15| All right. Thank you. Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1815)|
| 0:30:17| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1817)|
| 0:30:21| Ms. Nancy Elizabeth McBee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1821)|
| 0:30:31| It's actually Nancy Elizabeth McBee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1831)|
| 0:30:33| McBee, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1833)|
| 0:30:34| Nancy McBee. I reside at 6547 Virginia Lee Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1834)|
| 0:30:39| I've lived in Knox County my entire life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1839)|
| 0:30:41| Grew up in northeast Knox County on a farm that's been in my family over 200 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1841)|
| 0:30:46| Went to Coryton Elementary School, Gibbs High School with Commissioner Beeler over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1846)|
| 0:30:51| Attended the University of Tennessee and majored in engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1851)|
| 0:30:55| Graduated from UT and I've worked for three major corporations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1855)|
| 0:31:00| The current corporation I'm working for is Train, and we actually do business with Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1860)|
| 0:31:06| We do energy work for the county government and the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1866)|
| 0:31:11| Associated with that, I'm a board member of ASHRAE,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1871)|
| 0:31:14| which is the American Society of Heating, Air Conditioning, and Refrigeration Engineers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1874)|
| 0:31:18| of which I was the president of the East Tennessee chapter several years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1878)|
| 0:31:23| I've been a Girl Scout troop leader, a PTSO president.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1883)|
| 0:31:27| I've helped form two charitable foundations at Shannondale Elementary School and Gresham Middle School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1887)|
| 0:31:33| that raise money for things that the schools need that the county, the school system can't fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1893)|
| 0:31:39| And I'm currently the co-president of the Central High School Foundation where my daughter's a senior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1899)|
| 0:31:46| I'm in this year's Leadership Knoxville 2020 class, best class ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1906)|
| 0:31:52| And I guess it's through that that I've decided I need to branch out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1912)|
| 0:31:56| and see if there's more things I can do for my community to make it a better place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1916)|
| 0:32:00| It was suggested that the Ethics Committee would be a good place for me to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1920)|
| 0:32:04| So that's my three minutes. Now I'm down to three, three, three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1924)|
| 0:32:08| You've actually got a few more minutes if you want to keep it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1928)|
| 0:32:11| Well, I guess I could go on. I have not reviewed the manual yet, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1931)|
| 0:32:16| I am on social media, on several social media platforms because I have a teenage daughter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1936)|
| 0:32:23| and I need to monitor what she does. I do post things on Facebook, never anything negative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1943)|
| 0:32:29| Usually it's pictures of Central High School cheerleaders and my daughter and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1949)|
| 0:32:35| All right, thank you. Any questions? Yes, Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1955)|
| 0:32:40| Hi, thank you. Do you have any family affiliation that may have ties to Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1960)|
| 0:32:45| And do you have any contracts or do business with Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1965)|
| 0:32:49| I have no family members that work for Knox County, but my company, Train,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1969)|
| 0:32:53| does quite a bit of work for the county and the county school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1973)|
| 0:32:58| Okay, Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1978)|
| 0:33:00| I guess this question for the law department, will that make any difference if she's working for Train?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1980)|
| 0:33:07| I think the school system uses Train more than the county does, and I think they have their own ethics, don't they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1987)|
| 0:33:14| The school board has their own ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1994)|
| 0:33:18| The rules say that you can't be an employee of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=1998)|
| 0:33:23| and contracted services can create an employer-employee relationship, but generally it is with the company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2003)|
| 0:33:34| That would be something you all have to fit out in your own voting as to how you want to deal with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2014)|
| 0:33:40| But my understanding, the Train company's contract is with the schools, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2020)|
| 0:33:46| Well, with the county government also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2026)|
| 0:33:48| The county government also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2028)|
| 0:33:49| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2029)|
| 0:33:53| Good question. Commissioner Beeler, are you next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2033)|
| 0:33:58| I think, John, your light may have come on sooner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2038)|
| 0:34:01| So Commissioner Skinmaker, then back to Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2041)|
| 0:34:03| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2043)|
| 0:34:05| But just for clarification, your employment for Train,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2045)|
| 0:34:10| you are not the account executive that handles Knox County or Knox County schools, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2050)|
| 0:34:17| I'm one of the two primary contacts for the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2057)|
| 0:34:21| I don't do a whole lot with the county government side of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2061)|
| 0:34:26| And I do appreciate your service on the Tennessee TDDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2066)|
| 0:34:32| Tennessee Technology Corridor Development Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2072)|
| 0:34:35| Thank you for doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2075)|
| 0:34:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2077)|
| 0:34:38| Thank you. Back to you, Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2078)|
| 0:34:39| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2079)|
| 0:34:40| I was going to invite you to the homecoming game this week, but since I know we're going to see you next week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2080)|
| 0:34:44| I'll let you off the hook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2084)|
| 0:34:46| I'll be at Gibbs next Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2086)|
| 0:34:48| Very good. Are there any additional questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2088)|
| 0:34:50| Okay, thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2090)|
| 0:34:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2092)|
| 0:34:53| All right, next, Ms. Elizabeth Sherrod.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2093)|
| 0:35:06| So it's Elizabeth Sherrod, Elizabeth with a Z.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2106)|
| 0:35:09| Sherrod is S-H-E-R-R-O-D as in David, and I live at 533 Panorama Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2109)|
| 0:35:16| So thank you all for this opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2116)|
| 0:35:18| I'm usually much better at promoting other people than myself, so it's a little tough for me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2118)|
| 0:35:22| but we'll get through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2122)|
| 0:35:24| Most of you got a copy of my resume, and it's pretty easy to see from my resume that I have spent my entire professional career| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2124)|
| 0:35:30| doing investigations that involved either ethical and or criminal investigations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2130)|
| 0:35:34| So, yes, I can make those tough decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2134)|
| 0:35:37| I've made them for 29-plus years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2137)|
| 0:35:41| In doing so, I learned early to be very careful when conducting those investigations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2141)|
| 0:35:46| It's all about the evidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2146)|
| 0:35:48| It's not about my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2148)|
| 0:35:50| The evidence will tell me where we're going and what we're going to do with that when we get to the end of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2150)|
| 0:35:55| I also learned very early to be careful to guard the reputation of the person being investigated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2155)|
| 0:36:03| It's not my job to ruin their reputation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2163)|
| 0:36:05| It's my job to conduct a thorough and objective investigation and pass that on to the powers that be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2165)|
| 0:36:10| In my case, it was either federal prosecutors or it was state attorneys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2170)|
| 0:36:16| of which I built a lot of good relationships with them and also with defense attorneys in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2176)|
| 0:36:23| Most of them I sat across from until I retired about six years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2183)|
| 0:36:26| Now I work for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2186)|
| 0:36:28| And I will tell you that they came looking for me based on the reputation that I built in 29 years at the Office of Inspector General.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2188)|
| 0:36:37| I've also been a member of the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners for numerous years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2197)|
| 0:36:42| If you're familiar with that or not familiar with that, if you'll think of a CPA as to accountant, a CFE is to an investigator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2202)|
| 0:36:50| That holds me to a higher standard of ethics than any other investigator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2210)|
| 0:36:54| I work under a set of code of ethics already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2214)|
| 0:36:57| It says I will do this job in a certain manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2217)|
| 0:37:00| It says I will not do jobs I'm not qualified for, meaning when customers or clients come to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2220)|
| 0:37:05| if I'm not qualified for their investigation, I tell them that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2225)|
| 0:37:08| And it's cost me money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2228)|
| 0:37:10| Yes, it does every day when I tell people I can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2230)|
| 0:37:13| I worked under a very strict code of ethics for 26-plus years when I worked for the federal government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2233)|
| 0:37:19| because the federal government has a very strict code of ethics, much like Knox County's, which I have read, Mr. Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2239)|
| 0:37:25| I read those online, your Knox County Ethics and the Ethics Committee rules and regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2245)|
| 0:37:30| Carson, yes, I'm on social media, as you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2250)|
| 0:37:34| I try to be very positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2254)|
| 0:37:37| Jay, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2257)|
| 0:37:38| Larson, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2258)|
| 0:37:39| I have no family that works for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2259)|
| 0:37:42| My stepson is now a pilot in the private industry, so he no longer works for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2262)|
| 0:37:47| And we have no contracts with the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2267)|
| 0:37:49| So I think that was all the questions there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2269)|
| 0:37:53| I have learned in my life ethics is not a simple job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2273)|
| 0:37:58| There are some black and white issues, such as nepotism and conflicts of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2278)|
| 0:38:02| Those are fairly easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2282)|
| 0:38:04| But ethics as a whole takes a lot of wisdom and discernment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2284)|
| 0:38:09| One of the hardest ones, I would think, is lying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2289)|
| 0:38:12| And so when you get asked that question, do you lie, I have to answer that question, yes, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2292)|
| 0:38:18| I took care of two elderly parents with dementia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2298)|
| 0:38:22| And if you've cared for an elderly parent with dementia, you lie because your job is to keep the peace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2302)|
| 0:38:28| and to give them comfort and to give them grace and to give them dignity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2308)|
| 0:38:33| So ethics is not a black and white down the line every time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2313)|
| 0:38:38| It is in a lot of issues, but it's not in some issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2318)|
| 0:38:41| And I think my experience professionally and personally gives me an insight into that that others don't have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2321)|
| 0:38:50| And so I'll take any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2330)|
| 0:38:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2332)|
| 0:38:53| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2333)|
| 0:38:54| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2334)|
| 0:38:56| Ms. Sherrod, if you are appointed to the Ethics Committee, although you are a citizen representative on that committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2336)|
| 0:39:04| you are essentially now inside the bubble of government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2344)|
| 0:39:08| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2348)|
| 0:39:09| What would happen if somebody came to you in your ‑‑ if you were to be serving on that Ethics Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2349)|
| 0:39:15| and somebody came to you in a business sense and asked you to be a private investigator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2355)|
| 0:39:20| for somebody else within the walls of government?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2360)|
| 0:39:23| How would you handle that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2363)|
| 0:39:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2366)|
| 0:39:27| So just so I understand, you're asking if I had somebody come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2367)|
| 0:39:30| and ask me to investigate a member of the Knox County government?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2370)|
| 0:39:34| Is that what you're asking me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2374)|
| 0:39:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2375)|
| 0:39:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2376)|
| 0:39:37| I just want to make sure I understood your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2377)|
| 0:39:40| More likely than not, I would recuse myself, just as I do now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2380)|
| 0:39:45| So let me explain how this works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2385)|
| 0:39:49| I worked for TVA for 26‑plus years, and my niche is health care fraud,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2389)|
| 0:39:56| and I have an excellent reputation in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2396)|
| 0:39:58| It's what I do, and I'm good at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2398)|
| 0:40:01| And so currently, when an attorney calls me and says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2401)|
| 0:40:05| hey, I want you to work on a case, the first question out of their mouth is usually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2405)|
| 0:40:09| here's my client, are you conflicted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2409)|
| 0:40:12| And I've lost a few cases because, yes, I'm conflicted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2412)|
| 0:40:16| meaning somehow or the other I know that person or I'm connected to that person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2416)|
| 0:40:20| or I investigated that person or I had work involving that person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2420)|
| 0:40:23| or that industry or that entity before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2423)|
| 0:40:26| And so I just recuse myself and I refer them to somebody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2426)|
| 0:40:30| So in this case, I would probably ask the law director for his opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2430)|
| 0:40:35| but more likely than not, I'd recuse myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2435)|
| 0:40:38| And not take the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2438)|
| 0:40:39| And not take the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2439)|
| 0:40:41| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2441)|
| 0:40:43| Thank you, Commissioner Bessler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2443)|
| 0:40:45| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2445)|
| 0:40:46| Since you've read the manual back there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2446)|
| 0:40:48| what's the one standard that you use when you handle an ethical complaint?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2448)|
| 0:40:53| Well, first of all, you need to ensure that it's a valid complaint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2453)|
| 0:40:56| that meets all the criteria laid out in your rules and regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2456)|
| 0:40:59| that it came in in a timely manner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2459)|
| 0:41:01| that it can be supported by a particular set of facts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2461)|
| 0:41:04| that if it meets those standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2464)|
| 0:41:05| it can be referred to the county law director for his investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2465)|
| 0:41:12| So that would be what I would look to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2472)|
| 0:41:13| That's the most important thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2473)|
| 0:41:15| Is it a valid complaint?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2475)|
| 0:41:22| Does that catch your question, Commissioner Bessler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2482)|
| 0:41:25| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2485)|
| 0:41:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2487)|
| 0:41:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2488)|
| 0:41:29| Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2489)|
| 0:41:31| Just to piggyback off Commissioner Jay's comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2491)|
| 0:41:34| are you currently investigating anyone with Knox County government or anyone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2494)|
| 0:41:40| I'm not a member of the Ethics Committee yet, so no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2500)|
| 0:41:44| Do you have a guilty conscience?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2504)|
| 0:41:46| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2506)|
| 0:41:47| I just wanted to know if it's going to hurt your current investigation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2507)|
| 0:41:51| if you do get on the Ethics Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2511)|
| 0:41:52| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2512)|
| 0:41:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2513)|
| 0:41:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2514)|
| 0:41:55| No, there are not any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2515)|
| 0:41:56| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2516)|
| 0:41:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2517)|
| 0:41:58| Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2518)|
| 0:41:59| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2519)|
| 0:42:00| I just wanted to congratulate you on your service with the Metro Drug Coalition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2520)|
| 0:42:02| That's a great body, and I appreciate you serving on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2522)|
| 0:42:05| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2525)|
| 0:42:06| I love doing that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2526)|
| 0:42:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2529)|
| 0:42:10| Thank you very much for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2530)|
| 0:42:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2531)|
| 0:42:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2532)|
| 0:42:13| Next, let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2533)|
| 0:42:14| You want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2534)|
| 0:42:18| Mr. Michael Singletary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2538)|
| 0:42:23| Is Mr. Singletary here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2543)|
| 0:42:27| Well, I'll walk through that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2547)|
| 0:42:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2551)|
| 0:42:32| Ms. Tanya Thomas-Coates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2552)|
| 0:42:36| Mr. Chairman, I think we have an error in our packet regarding this applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2556)|
| 0:42:42| In checking with the commission office, we received ñ it came in by fax, I guess it was, by fax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2562)|
| 0:42:49| and we got two copies of page two, but not probably page one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2569)|
| 0:42:54| I just noticed an email that came in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2574)|
| 0:42:56| It shows that her employment ended in, like, 1994, so we don't have whatever is current for her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2576)|
| 0:43:03| So we've just double-checked to make sure, and we've got two pages of page two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2583)|
| 0:43:08| and the cover of page, and page three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2588)|
| 0:43:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2591)|
| 0:43:12| Well, and we can certainly give her a chance to bring us up to speed on anything that may have been missed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2592)|
| 0:43:17| when we got the initial resume in, which will be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2597)|
| 0:43:21| Did you also get it via ñ I think they sent it via email as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2601)|
| 0:43:26| so you should have received it via email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2606)|
| 0:43:30| It starts at Family Dollar Store, two pages, nothing prior to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2610)|
| 0:43:36| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2616)|
| 0:43:37| So that's the people that had sent it, but I was out of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2617)|
| 0:43:40| But I will catch you up to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2620)|
| 0:43:42| Tell you what, just bring us up to speed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2622)|
| 0:43:45| I'm going to go ahead and give you an extra minute or so just if we got an incorrect resume| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2625)|
| 0:43:51| for one of the pages that was missing because of a technical error.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2631)|
| 0:43:54| So if you'd like ñ well, first of all, go ahead and state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2634)|
| 0:43:57| and tell us just a little bit about why you'd like to serve on this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2637)|
| 0:44:02| and then after that, I guess professionally, just bring us up to speed, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2642)|
| 0:44:07| I will do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2647)|
| 0:44:08| My name is Tanya Thomas-Coates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2648)|
| 0:44:10| It's spelled Tanya, but it's Tanya.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2650)|
| 0:44:12| I live at 1734 Woodhaven Drive in East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2652)|
| 0:44:16| So I am interested in actually being part of the Ethics Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2656)|
| 0:44:21| to actually just get some inner workings of having this connectiveness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2661)|
| 0:44:26| between Knox County Schools and Knox County Government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2666)|
| 0:44:31| I've always been particularly interested in Knox County Government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2671)|
| 0:44:35| not so much as I know that one of the questions is if I've read the manual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2675)|
| 0:44:41| So I know that there's nine pages of that manual, but I didn't really delve into it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2681)|
| 0:44:45| because I thought maybe if I had the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2685)|
| 0:44:49| So I am a military child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2689)|
| 0:44:52| I'm a product of my dad was in the military for 20-plus years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2692)|
| 0:44:56| So I grew up in military schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2696)|
| 0:44:58| I moved here in Knox County in 1989, where I ended up graduating from Jefferson County High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2698)|
| 0:45:05| So I've been in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2705)|
| 0:45:09| I now consider myself a Knoxvillian because I did graduate from the University of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2709)|
| 0:45:13| with two degrees from the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2713)|
| 0:45:17| So I'm all Vol, but my kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2717)|
| 0:45:21| So I am a single mom that I have two kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2721)|
| 0:45:24| I have a son that is a Vol after by way of going to Tennessee Wesleyan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2724)|
| 0:45:31| He ended up going into the military, following after his grandfather,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2731)|
| 0:45:36| and he is in the National Guard Armory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2736)|
| 0:45:40| I wish he hadn't have done it, but it's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2740)|
| 0:45:45| I'm going to support him by any means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2745)|
| 0:45:48| He's a junior there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2748)|
| 0:45:50| My daughter is a graduate from Middle Tennessee State University with a math,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2750)|
| 0:45:54| so I have that background in math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2754)|
| 0:45:57| So I always think about in regards to codes of ethics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2757)|
| 0:46:02| So this is a piece about why I'm particularly interested in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2762)|
| 0:46:09| So I have been in education for 25-plus years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2769)|
| 0:46:14| and I know that sometimes we have to be ethical with kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2774)|
| 0:46:20| It doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2780)|
| 0:46:21| We educate all kids in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2781)|
| 0:46:24| So I've taught in Maryville City Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2784)|
| 0:46:27| I taught there for two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2787)|
| 0:46:29| but then the rest of the time I've been here in Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2789)|
| 0:46:32| So I know ethically it doesn't matter where they come,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2792)|
| 0:46:37| what socioeconomic background they come from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2797)|
| 0:46:42| or what their stature is, or who their parents are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2802)|
| 0:46:45| We have to treat every child that we're trying to educate them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2805)|
| 0:46:49| So I'm very interested in knowing how the employees or the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2809)|
| 0:46:54| how you're being, what are some of your ethical backgrounds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2814)|
| 0:46:59| what are the things that actually come up in regards to ethics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2819)|
| 0:47:04| Now it's unfortunate that I don't know that you've had some challenges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2824)|
| 0:47:07| but I know that we've had some challenges on Knox County's side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2827)|
| 0:47:10| So I always try to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2830)|
| 0:47:13| So currently I serve as the president of the Knox County Education Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2833)|
| 0:47:17| I am also the vice president for the State of Tennessee Teachers Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2837)|
| 0:47:22| where it's my fiduciary duty to make sure that I am trustworthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2842)|
| 0:47:28| So I always tell the educators that when I go to bed at night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2848)|
| 0:47:32| I try to make sure that I'm representing you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2852)|
| 0:47:35| and I'm advocating for what you want as a classroom teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2855)|
| 0:47:38| My heart is to make sure that I'm not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2858)|
| 0:47:43| I try to line up all the facts that people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2863)|
| 0:47:47| and I take people for the word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2867)|
| 0:47:49| I think sometimes that is one of my weaknesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2869)|
| 0:47:51| I take people for what they tell me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2871)|
| 0:47:54| And what you tell me, I believe it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2874)|
| 0:47:56| until I see otherwise when it's in writing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2876)|
| 0:47:59| or if it comes to paperwork in front of me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2879)|
| 0:48:02| and if it's something different than I am going to tell you about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2882)|
| 0:48:06| I'm going to set you straight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2886)|
| 0:48:08| Because you cannot go around just treating people bad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2888)|
| 0:48:12| and I think that is not a good sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2892)|
| 0:48:16| So I make sure that I go to bed and I can sleep well at night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2896)|
| 0:48:19| because I know that whatever comes out of my mouth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2899)|
| 0:48:21| whatever I do is trustworthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2901)|
| 0:48:25| So I believe somebody that's ethical in being on that committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2905)|
| 0:48:28| that you don't really, you're not pointing the fingers at people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2908)|
| 0:48:31| but you're actually trying to line up the evidence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2911)|
| 0:48:33| and trying to make sure that, one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2913)|
| 0:48:35| that you're doing what is fair and equitable to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2915)|
| 0:48:40| and I have a passion about women.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2920)|
| 0:48:43| So back in the late 90s, I started a program called Moms VIP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2923)|
| 0:48:53| and there was a crisis in Knox County about young women| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2933)|
| 0:48:56| that were going to school having children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2936)|
| 0:48:58| So I partnered with Knox County Health Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2938)|
| 0:49:01| of actually making sure that anywhere from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2941)|
| 0:49:04| we had some cases where young people, as young as 10 years old,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2944)|
| 0:49:09| have children, and as old as 30-plus years old,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2949)|
| 0:49:16| and help them understand why they need to have health care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2956)|
| 0:49:22| know all the health care challenges about stillborn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2962)|
| 0:49:26| and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2966)|
| 0:49:28| So I did have a relationship with Knox County at that point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2968)|
| 0:49:31| because we actually helped provide chairs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2971)|
| 0:49:33| and make sure they got to their hospital appointments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2973)|
| 0:49:36| and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2976)|
| 0:49:38| But I try to make sure that I'm very ethical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2978)|
| 0:49:40| I serve on several boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2980)|
| 0:49:42| I serve on the NAACP board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2982)|
| 0:49:44| I'm the actual treasurer at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2984)|
| 0:49:47| I am their treasurer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2987)|
| 0:49:49| So people know that I'm very stingy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2989)|
| 0:49:52| I think it's my responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2992)|
| 0:49:54| It's not my money, but it's the people's money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2994)|
| 0:49:56| that you just don't spend people's money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2996)|
| 0:49:59| You just do what they tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=2999)|
| 0:50:01| So if somebody tells me to do something, that's what I do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3001)|
| 0:50:03| not unless it didn't come from a board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3003)|
| 0:50:05| I've served on Great Schools Partnership Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3005)|
| 0:50:08| and I've served on several different capacities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3008)|
| 0:50:10| But to know that I try to be trustworthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3010)|
| 0:50:16| If that's helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3016)|
| 0:50:17| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3017)|
| 0:50:19| I saw a light over here earlier, but I wanted to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3019)|
| 0:50:21| I think it was actually Bud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3021)|
| 0:50:22| Was that the light in front of you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3022)|
| 0:50:24| All right, all right, might have bumped into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3024)|
| 0:50:26| Okay, go ahead, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3026)|
| 0:50:29| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3029)|
| 0:50:31| Ms. Coates, do you have any relatives that work for Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3031)|
| 0:50:35| Not anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3035)|
| 0:50:36| My father is a retired firefighter from the Knox County Fire Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3036)|
| 0:50:40| and he retired about two years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3040)|
| 0:50:42| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3042)|
| 0:50:43| And any contracts or any other business with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3043)|
| 0:50:46| I don't have that kind of money, so no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3046)|
| 0:50:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3048)|
| 0:50:49| A question for our law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3049)|
| 0:50:51| You said that the school system has a separate ethics committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3051)|
| 0:50:56| They have a separate ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3056)|
| 0:50:58| The legal question would be, are they an employee of Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3058)|
| 0:51:02| And under some of the cases that we've run into,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3062)|
| 0:51:05| if we do the payroll, we are considered a co-employer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3065)|
| 0:51:13| So right now, for another about 18 to 24 months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3073)|
| 0:51:17| I am not an employee of Knox County Schools because they pay for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3077)|
| 0:51:22| the Knox County Education Association pays for my salary through the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3082)|
| 0:51:27| So I am not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3087)|
| 0:51:28| You're not currently employed by the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3088)|
| 0:51:30| No, I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3090)|
| 0:51:31| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3091)|
| 0:51:34| If it's an agreement, it's a memorandum of understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3094)|
| 0:51:36| knowing that I'm off on leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3096)|
| 0:51:41| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3101)|
| 0:51:42| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3102)|
| 0:51:46| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3106)|
| 0:51:48| Facebook, Instagram, Twitter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3108)|
| 0:51:52| So I am on those social media sites,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3112)|
| 0:51:55| and I can say that I try to use that for positivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3115)|
| 0:51:58| If not, it can make you cry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3118)|
| 0:52:01| I can go through my Facebook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3121)|
| 0:52:04| Some of the things that I've just recently posted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3124)|
| 0:52:06| was about gun control in the United States, about kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3126)|
| 0:52:11| So it's a PSA that I posted about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3131)|
| 0:52:16| If you hadn't seen it, it's about the PBS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3136)|
| 0:52:20| They had a commercial about kids having to run to get new shoes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3140)|
| 0:52:25| and you'd think it's really great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3145)|
| 0:52:29| Publicity about kids the first day of school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3149)|
| 0:52:32| but they were actually running from an active shooter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3152)|
| 0:52:34| and you can hear it in the background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3154)|
| 0:52:35| So I always post things that bring awareness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3155)|
| 0:52:39| to what's going on for kids in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3159)|
| 0:52:41| If not, I'm always posting about my kids because I love my kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3161)|
| 0:52:44| I'm a surrogate mother to my brother's kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3164)|
| 0:52:48| and I've been a surrogate mother for the last three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3168)|
| 0:52:50| So I always post things to help people be aware of what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3170)|
| 0:52:57| But I don't publicly taunt people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3177)|
| 0:53:00| I just want people to be aware of what's going on in my profession,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3180)|
| 0:53:04| and particularly education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3184)|
| 0:53:06| But most of it's always uplifting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3186)|
| 0:53:09| And I've also posted in the last couple of weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3189)|
| 0:53:11| about we needing funding from the state for public education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3191)|
| 0:53:16| So if you always see me on Wednesday, I always have on red,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3196)|
| 0:53:19| and I'm always posting I'm red for ed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3199)|
| 0:53:22| because they need to fund public education more on the state level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3202)|
| 0:53:26| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3206)|
| 0:53:27| And the second one was, and this is for everybody again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3207)|
| 0:53:31| for the three people the sheriff's got an appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3211)|
| 0:53:35| But you are a quasi-judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3215)|
| 0:53:38| You are judging people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3218)|
| 0:53:41| You are judging people's lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3221)|
| 0:53:44| And I want you and everyone to understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3224)|
| 0:53:50| that you have to follow the evidence to make sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3230)|
| 0:53:57| and I just want to make sure that you understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3237)|
| 0:54:00| and confirm that you will look at the evidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3240)|
| 0:54:03| And if the law department or the investigator comes back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3243)|
| 0:54:08| and says there's no standing, there's no evidence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3248)|
| 0:54:11| it's still not going to be voted through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3251)|
| 0:54:15| That's how important you are a quasi-judicial judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3255)|
| 0:54:19| If you're judging, you could be judging me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3259)|
| 0:54:22| Who knows?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3262)|
| 0:54:23| So I just hope you understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3263)|
| 0:54:26| I want you to understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3266)|
| 0:54:27| Yes, so that's very serious and stuff about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3267)|
| 0:54:30| when you have to read those types of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3270)|
| 0:54:33| So I deal with that when it comes to educators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3273)|
| 0:54:36| about them losing their job or losing their license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3276)|
| 0:54:42| You have to have the evidence in front of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3282)|
| 0:54:44| to make sure that teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3284)|
| 0:54:46| if they've actually done what they said they've done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3286)|
| 0:54:48| and if they don't, I know that the last four superintendents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3288)|
| 0:54:52| probably want to hang me up half the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3292)|
| 0:54:55| because I always say if it's not written| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3295)|
| 0:54:57| or if there's not any evidence behind it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3297)|
| 0:55:00| that it didn't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3300)|
| 0:55:02| And I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3302)|
| 0:55:05| So they always sit me to the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3305)|
| 0:55:08| As Mr. Thomas says now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3308)|
| 0:55:10| because we have a really great working relationship,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3310)|
| 0:55:13| he always says, you always stick me in the gut for something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3313)|
| 0:55:17| And I said, if it's not written, it didn't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3317)|
| 0:55:22| If there's no evidence, nobody video-recorded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3322)|
| 0:55:25| you can't go by opinion because if you do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3325)|
| 0:55:30| then that's subjectivity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3330)|
| 0:55:32| and I don't want somebody to base something against me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3332)|
| 0:55:37| because of my color, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3337)|
| 0:55:39| So you want to make sure that the evidence is in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3339)|
| 0:55:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3342)|
| 0:55:43| Commissioner Bessler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3343)|
| 0:55:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3345)|
| 0:55:46| Tanya.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3346)|
| 0:55:47| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3347)|
| 0:55:48| This is not a gotcha question or anything like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3348)|
| 0:55:51| and you already said that you've scanned over the code of ethics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3351)|
| 0:55:57| and what we have here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3357)|
| 0:55:59| Now let me ask you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3359)|
| 0:56:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3360)|
| 0:56:01| When you approach a problem like you will be doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3361)|
| 0:56:05| on the Ethics Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3365)|
| 0:56:06| what would be your number one thought when you go in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3366)|
| 0:56:18| It's in the Constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3378)|
| 0:56:19| I'll help you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3379)|
| 0:56:24| At this point, I can't really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3384)|
| 0:56:26| I think you touched on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3386)|
| 0:56:28| I'll give you a chance to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3388)|
| 0:56:31| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3391)|
| 0:56:32| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3392)|
| 0:56:33| You said what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3393)|
| 0:56:34| It's in the Constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3394)|
| 0:56:36| You're innocent until proven guilty would be the one thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3396)|
| 0:56:39| But anyway, I wasn't trying to catch you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3399)|
| 0:56:42| I was just trying to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3402)|
| 0:56:43| So that is just because I was first going to say that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3403)|
| 0:56:47| I was not going to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3407)|
| 0:56:49| I was going to say, well, I don't have anything before me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3409)|
| 0:56:53| so the first thing I would have to wait until I got whatever I had in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3413)|
| 0:56:57| I mean, because I couldn't really say somebody's guilty or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3417)|
| 0:57:01| without even knowing what I was supposed to be doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3421)|
| 0:57:04| But the assumption would be when you go in, you're innocent until proven guilty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3424)|
| 0:57:08| Well, everybody is always innocent until proven guilty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3428)|
| 0:57:11| I always tell people they have a fair chance with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3431)|
| 0:57:13| I always tell the kids in my classroom, you have an A until you start making an F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3433)|
| 0:57:22| Tony, just a quick question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3442)|
| 0:57:25| I've had the pleasure of working with you on the Great Schools Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3445)|
| 0:57:28| which has been doing an awesome job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3448)|
| 0:57:30| I know with your volunteer work, which is paid work for TEA or for Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3450)|
| 0:57:36| when you're done with that, are you probably going to go back into the classroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3456)|
| 0:57:39| or kind of what's your plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3459)|
| 0:57:41| And the reason I'm asking is with this appointment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3461)|
| 0:57:45| it says in the rules that you can't be an employee of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3465)|
| 0:57:48| So my question was it could potentially be awkward if you got the appointment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3468)|
| 0:57:52| and then 12 months or I don't know exactly what the time is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3472)|
| 0:57:55| then 18 months if you went back into the classroom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3475)|
| 0:57:57| then a conflict could pop up like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3477)|
| 0:57:59| You'd have to resign your seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3479)|
| 0:58:01| So I just wanted to kind of put that out there because that's one of the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3481)|
| 0:58:04| that could be looming if you got this appointment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3484)|
| 0:58:07| and decided to go back in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3487)|
| 0:58:10| I'm not sure if you want to stay in advocacy work, which you're doing a great job on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3490)|
| 0:58:13| If you could kind of clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3493)|
| 0:58:16| So my trajectory is now that I just claim it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3496)|
| 0:58:19| I try to claim it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3499)|
| 0:58:21| It's always based on a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3501)|
| 0:58:24| So after my appointment as the president of the Knox County Education Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3504)|
| 0:58:30| I have a continuing election that at the end of my 18 months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3510)|
| 0:58:36| or 20 months I have right now, that my election for the state will be coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3516)|
| 0:58:41| And I am known to be the next president for the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3521)|
| 0:58:46| But I still have a household here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3526)|
| 0:58:49| So I won't be going back into the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3529)|
| 0:58:53| I will still be doing advocacy work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3533)|
| 0:58:56| Okay. All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3536)|
| 0:58:58| Any extra questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3538)|
| 0:59:01| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3541)|
| 0:59:03| Thank you. Thank you for the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3543)|
| 0:59:05| Okay. Next, we didn't receive a resume from him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3545)|
| 0:59:08| but Tony Brown spoke to me right before the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3548)|
| 0:59:11| and expressed an interest in applying for this role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3551)|
| 0:59:14| So I asked him to let him know that he was more than welcome to come and make a statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3554)|
| 0:59:18| Since we didn't get your resume, you've got six minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3558)|
| 0:59:21| If you need a little bit of extra time to clarify your background, Tony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3561)|
| 0:59:28| I think that's down about as low as it can go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3568)|
| 0:59:30| All right. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3570)|
| 0:59:32| My name is Anthony Brown, and my address is 4301 Willow Springs Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3572)|
| 0:59:38| It's a senior complex, and we're north of Knoxville right off of Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3578)|
| 0:59:45| I was born in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3585)|
| 0:59:48| I didn't always live here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3588)|
| 0:59:50| I've been living here for the last 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3590)|
| 0:59:53| My family came here actually in 1791 before Knoxville, lower Tennessee, existed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3593)|
| 0:59:59| And one of the things I like to feel is like I really care about Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3599)|
| 1:00:05| I feel like it's a part owner of it, and I would like to see it do well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3605)|
| 1:00:12| I would love to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3612)|
| 1:00:13| I have already served in several other committees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3613)|
| 1:00:16| and I was running for state commissioner when I got ill four years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3616)|
| 1:00:24| and had to drop out because I was ill for several months in the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3624)|
| 1:00:28| I wasn't in a wheelchair then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3628)|
| 1:00:30| I am now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3630)|
| 1:00:32| I ran for disposition on the Ethics Committee, I think was the time before the last time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3632)|
| 1:00:40| and I didn't win, of course, but I said, you know, next time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3640)|
| 1:00:46| And I was dealing with some health issues, and to a point I still am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3646)|
| 1:00:52| I'm in a chair, but, I mean, I'm able to do the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3652)|
| 1:00:56| My first 10 years of growing up employment, I was a restaurant manager learning how to manage people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3656)|
| 1:01:03| I'm a people person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3663)|
| 1:01:04| I love people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3664)|
| 1:01:06| Then I was into the computer field for many, many years, and I had a crew of 18 under me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3666)|
| 1:01:12| and we kept all the computers running for Anacoppa Incorporated across the whole United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3672)|
| 1:01:17| And then I came back to Knoxville because my mother was ill and she needed me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3677)|
| 1:01:22| I have six brothers and sisters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3682)|
| 1:01:24| Three of them have security clearance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3684)|
| 1:01:27| You don't get that when somebody's got trouble in their family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3687)|
| 1:01:30| You have to be squeaky clean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3690)|
| 1:01:32| And I used to talk to David Ross all the time about certain things, how to make Knoxville better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3692)|
| 1:01:38| and I enjoyed talking to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3698)|
| 1:01:40| He was, I think, a much better police chief than I'd seen before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3700)|
| 1:01:46| As far as the job, I did look at the manual, I guess it was two years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3706)|
| 1:01:54| You don't, the job is not going around policing everybody, looking for trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3714)|
| 1:01:59| The job is you sit there and only do something when they call you and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3719)|
| 1:02:03| hey, we've got something here for you guys to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3723)|
| 1:02:06| And then, as you said before, it's just something that you're going to look at the facts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3726)|
| 1:02:11| like Perry Mason, like Law and Order, like Blue Bloods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3731)|
| 1:02:15| You look at the facts, put yourself in their position, and remember, as Commissioner Daley said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3735)|
| 1:02:22| somebody's life could be in your hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3742)|
| 1:02:25| You don't ruin somebody's life with a maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3745)|
| 1:02:28| You find the facts, and where the facts take you, that's where you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3748)|
| 1:02:33| You don't want to ruin a man's or a woman's life over what you think they could have done or might have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3753)|
| 1:02:40| The facts will be there, and if the facts don't show it to be true, it didn't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3760)|
| 1:02:45| It's that simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3765)|
| 1:02:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3767)|
| 1:02:51| I guess that's about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3771)|
| 1:02:52| I love to serve, and my life's an open book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3772)|
| 1:02:56| Oh, right now, what I've been doing, I'm just officially retired,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3776)|
| 1:03:00| and I just do civil rights and community work in the neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3780)|
| 1:03:05| and sometimes I register people to vote, and that's all I do right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3785)|
| 1:03:10| Oh, I was president of the complex I lived at last year, and then I gave that up at the end of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3790)|
| 1:03:17| But I would love to serve Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3797)|
| 1:03:19| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3799)|
| 1:03:20| And I have no family working for Knox County right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3800)|
| 1:03:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3803)|
| 1:03:24| I've got just a real quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3804)|
| 1:03:25| You had mentioned earlier that you said you served on other committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3805)|
| 1:03:29| Could you kind of recap that for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3809)|
| 1:03:31| Library board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3811)|
| 1:03:32| Library board was one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3812)|
| 1:03:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3813)|
| 1:03:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3814)|
| 1:03:35| But you served on the library board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3815)|
| 1:03:36| Yeah, I served on the library board in East Knoxville District, and then I moved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3816)|
| 1:03:40| and then I served the library board in North Knoxville District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3820)|
| 1:03:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3824)|
| 1:03:45| Cool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3825)|
| 1:03:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3826)|
| 1:03:47| Any additional questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3827)|
| 1:03:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3829)|
| 1:03:50| Thank you, Mr. Up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3830)|
| 1:03:51| I'm sorry I didn't have my resume, but I didn't know about this coming up until I saw it tonight when I arrived.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3831)|
| 1:03:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3836)|

| 1:04:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3844)|
| 1:04:05| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3845)|
| 1:04:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3846)|
| 1:04:07| Sorry, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3847)|
| 1:04:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3848)|
| 1:04:09| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3849)|
| 1:04:10| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3850)|
| 1:04:11| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3851)|
| 1:04:12| It's not a question for any of the applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3852)|
| 1:04:13| It's just I want to thank everybody for taking the time and having the desire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3853)|
| 1:04:17| I'm kind of overwhelmed that we have, what, 10, 11 people that have came forward to serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3857)|
| 1:04:22| Knox County in this capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3862)|
| 1:04:24| Truly, thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3864)|
| 1:04:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3865)|
| 1:04:26| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3866)|
| 1:04:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3867)|
| 1:04:28| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3868)|
| 1:04:29| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3869)|
| 1:04:30| And could we just simply cover what will occur on Monday so that people could have an indication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3870)|
| 1:04:34| of where we are and what's going on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3874)|
| 1:04:35| Yeah, if y'all would like to come, this is going to appear as you, though you weren't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3875)|
| 1:04:39| here earlier, there's an agenda item that will be towards the very beginning of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3879)|
| 1:04:43| agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3883)|
| 1:04:44| It's agenda item number eight on next Monday's board of commissioner meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3884)|
| 1:04:48| So it's at the very, not at the very front, but towards the very beginning of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3888)|
| 1:04:53| And we will have a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3893)|
| 1:04:56| I've got, I'll read the rules at the meeting just to clarify for commissioners and anybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3896)|
| 1:05:00| who may be watching at home where the commissioners will be able to nominate folks for the position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3900)|
| 1:05:07| We'll do a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3907)|
| 1:05:08| You could see a scenario where all of you maybe get nominated or several of you get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3908)|
| 1:05:12| nominated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3912)|
| 1:05:13| And we'll go through a set process where, let's make this up, let's say four people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3913)|
| 1:05:18| were put on the floor to be voted for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3918)|
| 1:05:20| We'll do a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3920)|
| 1:05:22| And then if the person who got the fewest votes of that initial four will fall off of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3922)|
| 1:05:26| the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3926)|
| 1:05:27| And we'll go and work our way through a process until we get to the final two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3927)|
| 1:05:33| It can end in the first round because if one person gets six, it's over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3933)|
| 1:05:38| But if nobody gets six, if nobody gets six, well, I know, I'm just talking about each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3938)|
| 1:05:42| round.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3942)|
| 1:05:43| Each spot's a different round.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3943)|
| 1:05:44| But if nobody gets six, the bottom drops off and you do it all over again until you fill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3944)|
| 1:05:48| both spots in that manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3948)|
| 1:05:49| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3949)|
| 1:05:50| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3950)|
| 1:05:51| So that's what you should expect next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3951)|
| 1:05:52| Yes, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3952)|
| 1:05:53| I would like to just point out too that the Sheriff's Department does have one appointment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3953)|
| 1:05:56| as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3956)|
| 1:05:57| And if they were to put one of the applicants from tonight in that, then we would take them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3957)|
| 1:06:01| off our list for the nomination process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3961)|
| 1:06:03| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3963)|
| 1:06:04| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3964)|
| 1:06:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3965)|
| 1:06:06| Any additional comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3966)|
| 1:06:07| One little bit of good news for next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3967)|
| 1:06:09| There's no beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3969)|
| 1:06:10| So...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3970)|
| 1:06:11| Did...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3971)|
| 1:06:12| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3972)|
| 1:06:13| At some of these appointments, we've asked that the applicants be present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3973)|
| 1:06:17| But that's not a requirement at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3977)|
| 1:06:19| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3979)|
| 1:06:20| And y'all may want to watch this on TV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3980)|
| 1:06:21| I mean, you're welcome to come, but it's not necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3981)|
| 1:06:24| That's what tonight's hearing was all about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3984)|
| 1:06:26| So...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3986)|

| 1:06:30| I just want to clarify what Commissioner Jay said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3990)|
| 1:06:31| The Sheriff has already appointed a person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3991)|
| 1:06:36| He won't be choosing someone out of the ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3996)|
| 1:06:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=3999)|
| 1:06:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191021publichearing?start=4000)|
