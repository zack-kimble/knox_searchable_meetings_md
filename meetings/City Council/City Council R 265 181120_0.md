| 0:03:59| For the Mayor's report, I want to start by talking briefly about our officer who was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=239)|
| 0:04:07| attacked on Saturday after the game, Officer B.K. Hardin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=247)|
| 0:04:13| It was a horrendous and vicious attack on him as he was doing his job directing traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=253)|
| 0:04:19| at 17th and Cumberland after the UT game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=259)|
| 0:04:22| You all probably read he was struck in the back of the head with a blunt object and he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=262)|
| 0:04:26| suffered a serious head injury that required immediate surgery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=266)|
| 0:04:30| Fortunately, he went home today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=270)|
| 0:04:32| Chief Thomas and I were there on Sunday to visit with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=272)|
| 0:04:37| He was in amazingly good spirits, considering he literally has a hole in his head, as he tells us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=277)|
| 0:04:44| But his family was there and he was really recovering well, it appeared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=284)|
| 0:04:50| So, you know, it just strikes me, that reminds us of the everyday risk and the potential danger that our police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=290)|
| 0:04:59| officers as well as our firefighters face as they are doing their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=299)|
| 0:05:03| We are still trying to identify the attacker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=303)|
| 0:05:06| So if you have any information, please call 215-7212, 7212.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=306)|
| 0:05:14| You can remain anonymous, but please help us solve this crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=314)|
| 0:05:19| And I want to ask Chief Thomas if she has anything to add about Officer Hardin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=319)|
| 0:05:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=325)|
| 0:05:26| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=326)|
| 0:05:27| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=327)|
| 0:05:28| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=328)|
| 0:05:29| In fact, Officer Hardin came to the building today and attended roll call for his shift,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=329)|
| 0:05:33| and so it did the officers that work with him a lot of good to be able to see him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=333)|
| 0:05:36| And he is still in good spirits and recovering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=336)|
| 0:05:39| But he has a really wicked-looking reverse swoosh on the side of his head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=339)|
| 0:05:43| I think he said he was going to talk to Nike maybe, but we'll see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=343)|
| 0:05:47| But he is in good spirits and recovering very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=347)|
| 0:05:49| Thoughts and prayers have gone a long way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=349)|
| 0:05:51| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=351)|
| 0:05:52| And the community has really poured out a lot of love and support to him as well and to all of our officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=352)|
| 0:05:57| and we really appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=357)|
| 0:06:00| Also, I want to mention on Saturday many of us attended, or Sunday, a funeral for Gwen Winfrey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=360)|
| 0:06:07| who was one of our staff members for about 11 years in the Community Development Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=367)|
| 0:06:12| I was the Community Development Director and had the privilege of hiring her to work with us back in about 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=372)|
| 0:06:22| And she left us way too soon, and there was a real outpouring of love| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=382)|
| 0:06:27| and support for her at the funeral on Sunday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=387)|
| 0:06:30| As a Community Development staff person, she worked on blighted property, economic development, minor home repair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=390)|
| 0:06:39| a number of different, Empowerment Zone way back when, a number of different projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=399)|
| 0:06:43| And a lot of folks who knew her were there to honor her or send their condolences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=403)|
| 0:06:50| And also, Becky Wade, our Director, has announced that there's an award that we give out each year during the Equity Awards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=410)|
| 0:07:02| during our National Community Development Week, and that award will be renamed in her honor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=422)|
| 0:07:08| the Gwenlyn R. Winfrey Economic Development Award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=428)|
| 0:07:11| And it's very fitting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=431)|
| 0:07:12| If you ever had to deal with her, she made you follow every rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=432)|
| 0:07:17| She made you cross your eyes, dot your I's, cross your T's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=437)|
| 0:07:21| And some of the contractors were there and told me exactly about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=441)|
| 0:07:26| But they all appreciated her and the good work that she did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=446)|
| 0:07:30| I also want to take a minute tonight to remember Mickey Maloney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=450)|
| 0:07:34| And we just found out last night or this morning, you may have heard, that she passed away unexpectedly this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=454)|
| 0:07:41| She was the Director of the Office of Special Events for the city for about 10 years, 2000 to 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=461)|
| 0:07:48| I think I first got to know Mickey when I moved to South Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=468)|
| 0:07:52| and her mother-in-law was in the house that lived next door to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=472)|
| 0:07:56| And then when I was Community Development Director, I worked with her for those four years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=476)|
| 0:08:00| her last four years, I guess, with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=480)|
| 0:08:04| We had a lot of ribbon-cuttings in community development, and she was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=484)|
| 0:08:07| She and her staff made sure that they happened well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=487)|
| 0:08:10| Mickey elevated our signature events like Christmas in the City| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=490)|
| 0:08:13| and partnered with organizations like Dogwood Arts to showcase Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=493)|
| 0:08:17| She worked tirelessly and enthusiastically to promote Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=497)|
| 0:08:22| and her work and her efforts contributed greatly to the revitalization of downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=502)|
| 0:08:27| In her retirement, she continued to stay actively involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=507)|
| 0:08:30| and I always ran into her, I'm sure you all did, at public events and at different kinds of gatherings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=510)|
| 0:08:35| And it's always seemed I was always jealous of her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=515)|

| 0:08:41| or she was planning to go on her next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=521)|
| 0:08:44| So she understood how to enjoy, how to stay involved in the community, but also how to enjoy her retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=524)|
| 0:08:49| So we remember Mickey tonight as someone who always made things happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=529)|
| 0:08:54| who always had a smile, and never thought that any idea was out of reach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=534)|
| 0:08:59| So now we have Thanksgiving is two days away, and I want to wish everyone a very joyous Thanksgiving holiday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=539)|
| 0:09:07| with your family and friends, and if you travel, please be safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=547)|
| 0:09:11| A few quick reminders about city services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=551)|
| 0:09:14| Our City of Knoxville offices will be closed Thursday and Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=554)|
| 0:09:18| Of course, we have some people that never close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=558)|
| 0:09:21| Police, fire, public service, some people are always on the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=561)|
| 0:09:26| Knoxville area transit buses and trolleys will not run on Thanksgiving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=566)|
| 0:09:31| but on Friday, November 23rd, CAT will operate following its usual Saturday schedules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=571)|
| 0:09:37| Thanksgiving and Christmas are the only two holidays in which the city's contractor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=577)|
| 0:09:43| Waste Connections, does not run regular household garbage and recycling collection routes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=583)|
| 0:09:48| So if your regular pickup day is Thursday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=588)|
| 0:09:52| Waste Connections will collect your trash on Friday, and regular routes will be run on Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=592)|
| 0:10:00| City recycling drop-off centers will remain open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=600)|
| 0:10:03| but the Goodwill Industries attendant will not be available to assist with the household donations on Thursday, on Thanksgiving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=603)|
| 0:10:10| And finally, the city's solid waste management facility on Elm Street is closed Thanksgiving day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=610)|
| 0:10:16| and resumes regular hours of operation on Monday, November 26th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=616)|
| 0:10:21| So Mickey Maloney would have been happy to know that Christmas in the city kicks off this Friday, the day after Thanksgiving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=621)|
| 0:10:29| The Holidays on Ice outdoor skating rink on Market Square opens at 10 a.m.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=629)|
| 0:10:34| followed at 6 p.m. by the regal celebration of lights and the lighting of the 42-foot Christmas tree in Crouch Park Extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=634)|
| 0:10:42| I know our public service folks have been out there working hard to get everything ready in the ice skating rink to get that all ready for this weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=642)|
| 0:10:50| I'm sorry, I will be missing the tree lighting this year because my family and I will be celebrating my dad's 90th birthday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=650)|
| 0:10:57| So Vice Mayor Fenbar Saunders is stepping in to do my duties at the tree lighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=657)|
| 0:11:02| Thank you for doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=662)|
| 0:11:03| Oh, he kind of looks like Santa Claus, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=663)|
| 0:11:07| That's not part of the role, but hey, Santa doesn't show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=667)|
| 0:11:12| As always, we'll have fireworks and a visit from Santa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=672)|
| 0:11:15| And over on the Market Square stage, you can enjoy live music at the WDVX Ho Ho Ho Down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=675)|
| 0:11:22| For information on six weeks of Christmas in the city events, visit KnoxvilleTN.gov slash Christmas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=682)|
| 0:11:29| And also, if you're coming downtown, I have some parking information for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=689)|
| 0:11:34| In city-owned garages, as always, parking is free after 6 p.m. and on weekends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=694)|
| 0:11:39| But remember that State Street Garage is undergoing an expansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=699)|
| 0:11:43| We're building two decks and adding 570 new parking spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=703)|
| 0:11:48| But as always, progress is painful, and there's a huge construction crane up there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=708)|
| 0:11:54| And so during construction at different times, about half the current garage parking spaces will be unavailable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=714)|
| 0:12:01| So State Street Garage will fill up fast on Friday and whenever there are special events downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=721)|
| 0:12:07| If you want to know in real time how many parking spaces are open in each city garage, you can download the Parkopedia app.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=727)|
| 0:12:15| How many of you have that now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=735)|
| 0:12:17| Parkopedia. I've added mine to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=737)|
| 0:12:19| Parkopedia app.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=739)|
| 0:12:20| If you go to that, you can actually see all the garages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=740)|
| 0:12:23| You can see whether they're free or what, you know, what, depending on the time of day, what they're charging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=743)|
| 0:12:29| And you can find out the availability of parking spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=749)|
| 0:12:33| You may recall we budgeted and put in sensors in all the city garages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=753)|
| 0:12:37| So now you can see that there's X number of total spaces, and as of a certain time, X number of spaces are available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=757)|
| 0:12:46| Now, I can't promise when you leave home that all of those will be available when you get there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=766)|
| 0:12:51| so you can have whoever's not driving check on the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=771)|
| 0:12:54| But that's really a great app and will help people find, figure out which garage they'll have a better shot at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=774)|
| 0:13:01| So if you want more instructions on Parkopedia and how to manage that app,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=781)|
| 0:13:06| you can go to our State Street Garage blog at KnoxvilleTN.gov slash State Street and get instructions on using the Parkopedia app.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=786)|
| 0:13:16| You can also get weekly updates on what's happening with downtown events and regular updates on the garage expansion project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=796)|
| 0:13:23| So we encourage you to check out KnoxvilleTN.gov slash State Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=803)|
| 0:13:29| Council, this is the end of my report. Do any of you all have reports? Vice Mayor Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=809)|
| 0:13:34| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=814)|

| 0:14:13| I'd like to just take a moment to recognize the life and legacy of a South Knoxville icon and former State Senator Ben Ashley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=853)|
| 0:14:22| who passed away last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=862)|
| 0:14:24| There's so much to be said about his career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=864)|
| 0:14:26| He served in the State House and Senate for more than 32 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=866)|
| 0:14:31| He was the minority leader.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=871)|
| 0:14:33| He had a reputation as a statesman and a bridge builder, and he also served in the Navy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=873)|
| 0:14:39| I believe he served in the Korean War and was a small business owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=879)|
| 0:14:44| Services were held last weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=884)|

| 0:19:01| So this is related to an affordable housing development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1141)|
| 0:19:04| This will be 53 units, 25 duplexes, three single-family homes focused on 62 and older, so elderly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1144)|
| 0:19:13| serving folks that make roughly $32,000 a year and under.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1153)|
| 0:19:17| So think of somebody that's on a fixed income toward the end of their life, but they're still very independent and want a place to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1157)|
| 0:19:24| That's what this is all about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1164)|
| 0:19:25| So if there are any questions now or later, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1165)|
| 0:19:30| Some of us who are over 62 are not towards the end of our life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1170)|

| 0:20:02| People have concerns about any development in their neighborhood, and rightfully so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1202)|

| 0:20:11| And I think we did the process pretty well, but we can always get better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1211)|
| 0:20:14| So we'll keep trying to improve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1214)|

| 0:24:33| We have, y'all didn't sign up, but tell me your names again, and are you both going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1473)|
| 0:24:39| speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1479)|
| 0:24:40| I'm Paul Williams, and I'd like to turn over my time to Mr. Best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1480)|
| 0:24:46| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1486)|
| 0:24:47| And you, please state your name and address for the record, and we will set the timer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1487)|
| 0:24:51| and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1491)|
| 0:24:52| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1492)|
| 0:24:53| Hi, I'm Gary Best, 2243 Sevierville Road, Maryville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1493)|
| 0:24:57| Two weeks ago, we were here to appeal the variance on the height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1497)|
| 0:25:02| We've met with staff since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1502)|
| 0:25:04| We had had a variance of 72 feet nine years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1504)|
| 0:25:07| After meeting with staff, we agreed if we could bring our height of our building from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1507)|
| 0:25:11| 81 feet to 70 feet, that that would show that we're trying to meet to the variance that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1511)|
| 0:25:17| we had already been granted for this particular site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1517)|
| 0:25:21| So you are willing to accept that if counsel is to approve it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1521)|
| 0:25:25| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1525)|
| 0:25:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1526)|
| 0:25:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1527)|
| 0:25:28| Is that all you want to say, sir, at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1528)|
| 0:25:30| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1530)|
| 0:25:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1531)|
| 0:25:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1532)|
| 0:25:33| So there may be questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1533)|
| 0:25:34| And there's nobody to speak to the other side, because this is the BCA, but if you have questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1534)|
| 0:25:40| Peter, to counsel, Peter Ahrens is happy to answer them, or I guess Mr. Green would too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1540)|
| 0:25:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1546)|
| 0:25:47| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1547)|
| 0:25:48| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1548)|
| 0:25:49| Director Green, I guess I'll start asking you some questions on this, since we did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1549)|
| 0:25:55| you know, take a pause at the last meeting to have some discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1555)|
| 0:26:00| Can you tell us a little bit about how those discussions went?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1560)|
| 0:26:04| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1564)|
| 0:26:05| Councilmembers, Mayor, I met with Mr. Best and Mr. Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1565)|
| 0:26:09| We looked at all the existing commercial zoning districts and the office districts to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1569)|
| 0:26:14| if there were any of our current zoning districts which would permit the height requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1574)|
| 0:26:19| None of them would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1579)|
| 0:26:21| Our existing code is very suburban.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1581)|
| 0:26:23| It's interesting in the zoning district in which they are in allows an office of 90 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1583)|
| 0:26:29| but other buildings are capped at 45 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1589)|
| 0:26:32| Again, none of our existing zoning districts allow the height they requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1592)|
| 0:26:38| They did then work to reduce the height so that it would fall under the variance that was granted 10 years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1598)|
| 0:26:45| and that seemed to be an appropriate approach to resolve the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1605)|
| 0:26:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1610)|
| 0:26:51| So I guess what I want to ask you about is whether or not if they were to have a rezone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1611)|
| 0:27:01| and to rework their plans, was there something in the existing code that would work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1621)|
| 0:27:07| Nothing in the existing code that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1627)|
| 0:27:09| Again, it's interesting that we're stuck with our existing code being a very suburban code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1629)|
| 0:27:19| predicting that all the development would be that suburban low-profile sprawling development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1639)|
| 0:27:25| as opposed to something that's taller and more urban in its nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1645)|
| 0:27:30| So even if they were to change to C-4 but change the height of the building down from 70,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1650)|
| 0:27:36| there wouldn't be a possibility of doing what they're looking for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1656)|
| 0:27:39| The height limit, again, is 45 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1659)|
| 0:27:43| 45 feet, that's cutting another 25 feet off their building, which makes the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1663)|
| 0:27:49| especially on the lot there, on a small lot, makes it infeasible to construct the hotel and develop the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1669)|
| 0:28:00| Mr. Frost, let me turn to you and ask you a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1680)|
| 0:28:02| Since we're being asked tonight to grant a variance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1682)|
| 0:28:06| can you tell us what the standard of review for granting a variance would be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1686)|
| 0:28:10| I'll just read from Article Roman numeral 7, Section 2, Variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1690)|
| 0:28:16| The purpose of a variance is to modify the strict application of the specific requirements of the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1696)|
| 0:28:22| in the case of exceptionally irregular, narrow, shallow, or steep lots or other exceptional physical conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1702)|
| 0:28:29| whereby such strict application would result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1709)|
| 0:28:35| and would deprive the owner of the reasonable use of his land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1715)|
| 0:28:40| The variance shall only be used only when necessary to overcome some obstacle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1720)|
| 0:28:46| which is preventing an owner from using his property as the zoning ordinance intended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1726)|
| 0:28:52| And then it goes on in Part 6 to list the standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1732)|
| 0:28:58| And briefly, variances shall only be granted when special circumstances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1738)|
| 0:29:05| or conditions fully described in the findings of the Board do not apply generally in the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1745)|
| 0:29:13| Variances shall not be granted to allow a use otherwise excluded from the particular district in which it is requested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1753)|
| 0:29:20| which is not the case here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1760)|
| 0:29:23| And mere loss in value shall not justify a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1763)|
| 0:29:27| There must be a deprivation of beneficial use of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1767)|
| 0:29:32| Those are the overview of the criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1772)|
| 0:29:35| So by hardship, we really have to have the applicant be denied basically any practical use of the land?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1775)|
| 0:29:42| That's a reasonable interpretation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1782)|
| 0:29:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1785)|
| 0:29:48| Well, Mr. Best and Mr. Williams, I would like for us to be able to find a way for this to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1788)|
| 0:29:56| My hope would be that you could maybe rework your plans and find something else that would work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1796)|
| 0:30:00| But based on the standard of review for this variance, I don't see how we can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1800)|
| 0:30:07| You're not being removed from any practical use of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1807)|
| 0:30:10| So I want to see you be able to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1810)|
| 0:30:14| But unfortunately, I don't know how we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1814)|
| 0:30:18| So I'm going to move to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1818)|
| 0:30:25| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1825)|
| 0:30:26| Mr. Frost, go back and read some of that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1826)|
| 0:30:29| So, I mean, the size of the lot is part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1829)|
| 0:30:33| Read that part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1833)|
| 0:30:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1835)|
| 0:30:39| The purpose of the variance is to modify the strict application of the specific requirements of this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1839)|
| 0:30:44| in the case of exceptionally irregular, narrow, shallow, or steep lots or other exceptional physical conditions whereby| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1844)|
| 0:30:53| So, I mean, I think this lot, in looking at, let's talk about what's unusual about the steepness, the size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1853)|
| 0:31:04| You've got easements that go through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1864)|
| 0:31:05| Let's talk about that, Mr. Best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1865)|
| 0:31:07| This lot is one acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1867)|
| 0:31:09| It has 14 foot of fall, and it is fronted on two roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1869)|
| 0:31:14| So while Executive Park Drive is one level, when you come around the corner of that, you're in a full basement level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1874)|
| 0:31:21| So we gain a full story in this building by just changing streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1881)|
| 0:31:26| So that's one of the hardships because, like I said, whether we want a basement or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1886)|
| 0:31:31| if you look at the height from Executive Park Drive, we're in the 45 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1891)|
| 0:31:37| But when you turn the corner, we pick up 14 more feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1897)|
| 0:31:41| And so that's part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1901)|
| 0:31:42| And then, like I said, one acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1902)|
| 0:31:45| Most of the property out there, you would say, is in the lot sizes are greater than one acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1905)|
| 0:31:50| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1910)|
| 0:31:52| And we have hotels right across the street that's taller than the 45 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1912)|
| 0:31:55| Most lot sizes that people are putting hotels on are greater than one acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1915)|
| 0:32:00| I'd normally get a couple acres, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1920)|
| 0:32:05| You also have an easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1925)|
| 0:32:06| You have some easement that goes through this property as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1926)|
| 0:32:09| I have a sewer line going right through the middle of it, and I've got storm easements on all three sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1929)|
| 0:32:14| So when the property faces two streets, you've got two different setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1934)|
| 0:32:20| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1940)|
| 0:32:21| You've got a sewer easement that goes nearly diagonally through the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1941)|
| 0:32:26| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1946)|
| 0:32:27| You've got a 13-foot slope difference on one road to the next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1947)|
| 0:32:30| I mean, I think that is a hardship in trying to build a building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1950)|
| 0:32:35| And, you know, I'm in the motion to approve it and allow, would you say, 70 feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1955)|
| 0:32:41| Is that what you're asking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1961)|
| 0:32:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1962)|
| 0:32:44| Oh, that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1964)|
| 0:32:45| I'm in the motion to approve it at 70 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1965)|
| 0:32:50| Substitute motion, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1970)|
| 0:32:51| A substitute motion to amend it to allow it to 70 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1971)|
| 0:32:55| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1975)|
| 0:32:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1976)|
| 0:32:57| So we have right now a motion and a second to amend it to 70?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1977)|
| 0:33:01| 70 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1981)|
| 0:33:02| 70 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1982)|
| 0:33:03| That's what you've asked for, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1983)|
| 0:33:04| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1984)|
| 0:33:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1986)|
| 0:33:07| Discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1987)|
| 0:33:08| Councilwoman Ryder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1988)|
| 0:33:09| I'll hold it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1989)|
| 0:33:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1991)|
| 0:33:12| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1992)|
| 0:33:15| Councilwoman Welch?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1995)|
| 0:33:17| This question is for Gerald Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=1997)|
| 0:33:21| So under the zoning ordinance that is being proposed right now for commercial districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2001)|
| 0:33:27| are there districts that will accommodate this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2007)|
| 0:33:30| Is this one of the, I guess what I'm getting at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2010)|
| 0:33:32| is this one of the challenges that has been recognized through recode?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2012)|
| 0:33:37| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2017)|
| 0:33:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2018)|
| 0:33:39| There are new districts, proposed districts that would allow the height that is proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2019)|
| 0:33:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2024)|
| 0:33:48| Councilwoman Ryder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2028)|
| 0:33:49| So can I ask Mr. Green, in recode, what zone would be needed to do this proposed development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2029)|
| 0:33:57| CG2, CG3 come to mind most readily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2037)|
| 0:34:02| Maybe the, excuse me, I can't remember the height limits and the CR and CH, but they would be close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2042)|
| 0:34:11| I won't say those for certain, but CG2 and CG3 would allow the height proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2051)|
| 0:34:17| And I believe the CR or the, no, the CH would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2057)|
| 0:34:22| With the current proposal that they've come forth with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2062)|
| 0:34:24| They wouldn't need to retool or change anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2064)|
| 0:34:26| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2066)|
| 0:34:28| I think, I just want to point out to my, to muddy the waters, bring you something to think about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2068)|
| 0:34:34| because we got an email about this earlier this week from constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2074)|
| 0:34:38| There are proposals in recode to allow 70-foot buildings right up against single family housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2078)|
| 0:34:45| particularly on Magnolia and other areas, and I just think it's food for thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2085)|
| 0:34:50| Yes, and we've thought about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2090)|
| 0:34:52| and I've directed our consultants to look at restricting the height within 25 feet of residential structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2092)|
| 0:35:00| The height limit would be 40 feet, and there's a gradual step up as the setback increases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2100)|
| 0:35:05| For every one foot, an additional setback from the residential zoning district height would increase two feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2105)|
| 0:35:11| So we do respond to those emails, and that was a very valid concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2111)|
| 0:35:16| Okay, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2116)|
| 0:35:19| Okay, any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2119)|
| 0:35:21| Right now what we have before us is a substitute motion to approve the appeal at 70 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2121)|
| 0:35:27| Mayor, can I ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2127)|
| 0:35:29| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2129)|
| 0:35:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2130)|
| 0:35:31| Tell us a little bit what happened 10 years ago with the variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2131)|
| 0:35:38| We brought before this, before MPC, we were asked to rezone it to C3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2138)|
| 0:35:44| because C3 would allow an office building to go to 90 feet, but everything else to 45.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2144)|
| 0:35:51| So on direction of MPC 10 years ago, we had it rezoned to C3 and asked for the variance and got the 72-foot variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2151)|
| 0:36:00| It was for a hotel, which is what we're proposing now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2160)|
| 0:36:03| And if you look at our site plans, there's only one place to put a hotel on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2163)|
| 0:36:08| We've changed brands since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2168)|
| 0:36:11| But otherwise, it's the same kind of project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2171)|
| 0:36:15| And we were granted a variance 10 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2175)|
| 0:36:19| And why we weren't this time is our question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2179)|
| 0:36:22| Okay, and the variance, that's expired?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2182)|
| 0:36:27| That's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2187)|
| 0:36:28| Mr. Frost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2188)|
| 0:36:29| Yes, I looked under the Vested Rights Act, and whatever vested right they had that long since it expired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2189)|
| 0:36:37| I'm not even sure if they had one under a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2197)|
| 0:36:44| Okay, that's all I've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2204)|
| 0:36:47| Okay, any other discussions or questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2207)|
| 0:36:50| So the law director, in doing his job, has told me I stated that motion incorrectly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2210)|
| 0:36:56| so I'm going to try and state it properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2216)|
| 0:36:58| This is a substitute motion to amend the appeal to 70 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2218)|
| 0:37:02| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2222)|
| 0:37:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2223)|
| 0:37:04| So, and this will take two votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2224)|
| 0:37:05| If it passes on the first, on this, if this passes, the substitute motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2225)|
| 0:37:10| then we will vote to approve the appeal as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2230)|
| 0:37:13| All right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2233)|
| 0:37:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2234)|
| 0:37:15| So first, the first vote is the substitute motion to amend the appeal to 70 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2235)|
| 0:37:20| You ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2240)|
| 0:37:21| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2241)|
| 0:37:22| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2242)|
| 0:37:23| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2243)|
| 0:37:24| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2244)|
| 0:37:25| So we have one no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2245)|
| 0:37:26| And that passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2246)|
| 0:37:29| We go to the, I need a motion to approve the appeal as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2249)|
| 0:37:36| Motion to approve as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2256)|
| 0:37:38| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2258)|
| 0:37:39| Okay, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2259)|
| 0:37:41| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2261)|
| 0:37:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2262)|
| 0:37:43| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2263)|
| 0:37:44| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2264)|
| 0:37:45| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2265)|
| 0:37:46| One opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2266)|
| 0:37:47| The ayes have it, and so ordered with one no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2267)|
| 0:37:50| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2270)|
| 0:37:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2272)|
| 0:37:56| Item 10C is a resolution approving an appeal by Pond Gap Area Neighborhood Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2276)|
| 0:38:01| Incorporated, of the Metropolitan Planning Commission's approval of a use and review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2281)|
| 0:38:05| filed by ECG Acquisitions, LLC, property located on the west side of Hollywood Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2285)|
| 0:38:11| south of I-40, I-75, 2nd District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2291)|
| 0:38:16| Okay, counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2296)|
| 0:38:17| We also have some people signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2297)|
| 0:38:19| We'll first hear from the appellants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2299)|
| 0:38:21| That's Mr. David Williams and Ms. Roberta Potter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2301)|
| 0:38:25| So, as you know, Mr. Williams, you have up to five minutes, each of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2305)|
| 0:38:30| and there's a clock that will go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2310)|
| 0:38:34| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2314)|
| 0:38:35| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2315)|
| 0:38:36| And if you can, there you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2316)|
| 0:38:37| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2317)|
| 0:38:39| I'm David Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2319)|
| 0:38:40| I live at 505 Hollywood Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2320)|
| 0:38:43| I'm a fourth-generation Pond Gap resident, and I'm proud to say Pond Gap is a very diverse community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2323)|
| 0:38:49| I'd like to educate everyone tonight that we had affordable housing in Pond Gap before it became cool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2329)|
| 0:38:55| Twenty years ago, KCDC, with HUD financing, bought and renovated 50 rental homes in Pond Gap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2335)|
| 0:39:01| and made them affordable to tenants living in the homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2341)|
| 0:39:04| Many qualified and were able to become homeowners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2344)|
| 0:39:07| and KCDC met with the community many, many times during the renovation and purchase process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2347)|
| 0:39:13| They even helped us form our neighborhood organization and set aside meeting facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2353)|
| 0:39:18| Today, over 60 percent of these homes are still owned by their occupants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2358)|
| 0:39:22| The rest are rental units which become available from time to time at very affordable rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2362)|
| 0:39:27| In fact, of the almost 20 homes in the Pond Gap area now for sale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2367)|
| 0:39:31| everyone is below the average median price in the city for a home of $224,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2371)|
| 0:39:38| So for half of that, $112,000 or less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2378)|
| 0:39:43| Of course, the traffic woes are a big concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2383)|
| 0:39:46| We have showcased in our videos on our website, Facebook page Save Pond Gap, about the traffic and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2386)|
| 0:39:53| I'd like to point out that Hollywood, being two lanes, has 8,600 cars a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2393)|
| 0:39:59| Let's look at some four-lane highways such as Concord Street, Gleason Road, and Ray Mears that have about 8,100, 8,200 cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2399)|
| 0:40:09| Right now, Sutherland has 14,000 cars a day, only 500 short of Neyland Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2409)|
| 0:40:16| And we feel like when the apartments are being built, this is going to jump way above that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2416)|
| 0:40:21| Also, we have problems with the intersections at Hollywood and Sutherland and Hollywood at Paper Mill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2421)|
| 0:40:26| The turning radiuses are not up to standards for some school buses and long axle vehicles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2426)|
| 0:40:32| and we still are plagued with tractor-trailer trucks coming on the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2432)|
| 0:40:36| The apartment side is in a basement, posing a line of side issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2436)|
| 0:40:41| And anyone that's tried to get out of their driveway on Hollywood realize you have to look every which way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2441)|
| 0:40:46| Then you get out in the street, you look at your rearview mirror, there's a car right on your tail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2446)|
| 0:40:53| We had 3,000 cars added to our street when the Forest Heights Bridge came down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2453)|
| 0:40:58| There's really no room to do anything on Hollywood if you can't widen the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2458)|
| 0:41:02| In fact, for traffic calming, you really need to narrow it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2462)|
| 0:41:05| The average speed exceeds the speed limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2465)|
| 0:41:09| MPC, in their wisdom 20 years ago, pointed out that something has to be done for traffic on Hollywood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2469)|
| 0:41:16| They proposed at least a couple of medians to stop the tractor-trailer traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2476)|
| 0:41:20| We did have a meeting with city officials and the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2480)|
| 0:41:23| I know you remember one because you paid our neighborhood a wonderful compliment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2483)|
| 0:41:27| It's the first neighborhood meeting you attended where you received flowers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2487)|
| 0:41:31| So we appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2491)|
| 0:41:33| Also, we met with Mr. Hagerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2493)|
| 0:41:35| Probably the last meeting I attended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2495)|
| 0:41:38| If you do go our way, we'll give you some more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2498)|
| 0:41:40| We'd like to request Mr. Hagerman, at his earliest possible convenience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2500)|
| 0:41:45| if you would give us or make available the mathematical algorithms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2505)|
| 0:41:49| and empirical data you gathered to come to your conclusion that, quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2509)|
| 0:41:53| Hollywood can handle the traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2513)|
| 0:41:55| I know that's mathematical terminology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2515)|
| 0:41:57| I'm a math tutor, so I'll say mathematical formulas and numbers we can use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2517)|
| 0:42:02| We feel like if you approve this project without resolving the traffic issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2522)|
| 0:42:07| that's going to set a dangerous precedent for upcoming divisions of situations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2527)|
| 0:42:13| where people are wanting to build an apartment complex or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2533)|
| 0:42:17| Traffic is very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2537)|
| 0:42:18| It needs to be solved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2538)|
| 0:42:21| We do need a park in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2541)|
| 0:42:24| In fact, the MPC, again, in their wisdom, they said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2544)|
| 0:42:31| we need to have a nature area where the pond property is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2551)|
| 0:42:34| And definitely that's what the neighborhood needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2554)|
| 0:42:37| We really don't want our needs sacrificed with this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2557)|
| 0:42:41| And wrapping this up, we're pleased that adjacent neighborhoods like Forest Heights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2561)|
| 0:42:46| Sutherland Heights, and the Bearden Village Council agree with us wholeheartedly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2566)|
| 0:42:50| in opposition to this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2570)|
| 0:42:53| We feel the site is poor and the community really doesn't want this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2573)|
| 0:42:57| They want the park set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2577)|
| 0:42:59| And I can say Pond Gap has already led the way in affordable housing going back 20 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2579)|
| 0:43:04| I appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2584)|
| 0:43:05| I'll be happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2585)|
| 0:43:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2587)|
| 0:43:08| Thank you, Mr. Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2588)|
| 0:43:09| And now, Ms. Potter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2589)|
| 0:43:21| We'll get the timer set again for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2601)|
| 0:43:24| And thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2604)|
| 0:43:27| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2607)|
| 0:43:29| Roberta Potter, 4604 Crosby Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2609)|
| 0:43:34| We live in the subdivision right close to Pond Gap School right across Paper Mill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2614)|
| 0:43:39| And we use Hollywood all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2619)|
| 0:43:43| Anyway, I made a few notes, but I don't know if I can read them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2623)|
| 0:43:46| So I'm here because I love Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2626)|
| 0:43:50| I love our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2630)|
| 0:43:51| Never considered living anywhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2631)|
| 0:43:54| Our city is made up of great neighborhoods, and we feel like that we've got one of the best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2634)|
| 0:44:00| The Hollywood Hill subdivision has been our home for close to 40 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2640)|
| 0:44:04| We raised our children there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2644)|
| 0:44:06| And now we have grandchildren who are residents of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2646)|
| 0:44:11| You may not know that our forefathers named Hollywood Drive Pond Gap Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2651)|
| 0:44:15| And I don't know why they changed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2655)|
| 0:44:17| I don't know where it got changed, but it did somewhere along the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2657)|
| 0:44:21| Our neighborhood is now being threatened by developers who may not share our high regard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2661)|
| 0:44:27| for our neighborhood and our city because they live in Nashville, and that's understandable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2667)|
| 0:44:34| But we who live there know that this development is not right for our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2674)|
| 0:44:41| It's not right for numerous reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2681)|
| 0:44:43| And you heard David, and he's been our chairperson for a long time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2683)|
| 0:44:49| and has done many good things for our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2689)|
| 0:44:53| So my husband and I use Hollywood Drive between Pavement Hill and Sutherland every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2693)|
| 0:44:58| I don't know of a day that we don't use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2698)|
| 0:45:01| My office is located up Sutherland Avenue in Marble City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2701)|
| 0:45:06| And so at high traffic times, it's just almost impossible to, you know, get out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2706)|
| 0:45:12| Not always because there's times when the traffic is not quite as bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2712)|
| 0:45:17| But recently, a small portion of Hollywood was painted with a bike lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2717)|
| 0:45:22| which is a good thing for people who like to ride bikes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2722)|
| 0:45:26| But we've wondered why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2726)|
| 0:45:27| All of our residents there wonder why we've even joked about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2727)|
| 0:45:30| because we wouldn't dare get on a bike on that narrow street because it's dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2730)|
| 0:45:36| And it would be hard enough to walk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2736)|
| 0:45:39| So most of us don't walk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2739)|
| 0:45:42| My husband, Bill Potter, served with the Knoxville Fire Department 47 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2742)|
| 0:45:47| He served as deputy chief, about 30 of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2747)|
| 0:45:51| At a recent meeting, at our last neighborhood meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2751)|
| 0:45:54| he reported that it would be next to impossible for fire engine numbers 12| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2754)|
| 0:46:03| to get across there from Sutherland over to Hollywood with an addition of that many housing units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2763)|
| 0:46:11| because the traffic would be so bad and the cars on each side would have no place to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2771)|
| 0:46:17| So that would mean that someone who was having a heart attack| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2777)|
| 0:46:21| or an injury, a serious automobile injury, could not get the help they needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2781)|
| 0:46:26| and a possible loss of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2786)|
| 0:46:28| And my husband don't say much, as Mr. Sharp stands with his nose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2788)|
| 0:46:34| He don't say too much, but he was sort of on his bandwagon at the last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2794)|
| 0:46:38| So I said, Bill, please go up there and tell the city council how you feel about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2798)|
| 0:46:43| And he said no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2803)|
| 0:46:45| He's been sick recently with pneumonia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2805)|
| 0:46:48| And he said, I don't feel like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2808)|
| 0:46:50| But I said, okay, I'll tell them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2810)|
| 0:46:52| So that's why I'm here, just speaking for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2812)|
| 0:46:56| And we've been there in our neighborhood, I'd say, almost 40 years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2816)|
| 0:47:03| And we love it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2823)|
| 0:47:04| And we don't want to have to move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2824)|
| 0:47:06| We don't want our neighborhood to be a place where people would not desire to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2826)|
| 0:47:11| It has been a wonderful place for us to bring up our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2831)|
| 0:47:15| So I'm just here to say, if it were your neighborhood, what would you do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2835)|
| 0:47:20| I bet all of you would be up here saying, hey, don't do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2840)|
| 0:47:24| And so that's why I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2844)|
| 0:47:27| We ask you to reconsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2847)|
| 0:47:29| We know you've already been here once and you're probably tired of hearing us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2849)|
| 0:47:33| But we just wanted to make one last plea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2853)|
| 0:47:37| So we ask you tonight to turn down this project as it stands now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2857)|
| 0:47:42| because we just don't think it's right for our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2862)|
| 0:47:46| And we don't think it's the right thing to do for the people who live here in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2866)|
| 0:47:51| and, as Betsy Creepmore put it, our fair city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2871)|
| 0:47:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2876)|
| 0:47:57| Thank you, Ms. Potter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2877)|
| 0:47:58| Please give our regards to your husband, Chief Potter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2878)|
| 0:48:02| And now for those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2882)|
| 0:48:05| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2885)|
| 0:48:06| They agreed my name, but I should be on the list as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2886)|
| 0:48:09| Oh, what name is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2889)|
| 0:48:12| Come on down to your rep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2892)|
| 0:48:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2893)|
| 0:48:16| Please state your name and address for the record, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2896)|
| 0:48:18| My name is Stacy Varon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2898)|
| 0:48:20| I live at 617 Hollywood Road in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2900)|
| 0:48:24| And I've spoken several times at several different meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2904)|
| 0:48:28| And really my comments are pretty much always the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2908)|
| 0:48:33| Traffic and the safety issues that it brings are just a huge, huge concern to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2913)|
| 0:48:39| And now that I've sat through multiple meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2919)|
| 0:48:41| I understand that every single person that comes to the podium talks about traffic and flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2921)|
| 0:48:47| So I'm sure you're probably over it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2927)|
| 0:48:49| But in this particular case, traffic is really a huge concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2929)|
| 0:48:55| And the traffic study that was done bears out our concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2935)|
| 0:49:00| It's not just us going, no more traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2940)|
| 0:49:02| There's actual evidence to show that this is extremely dangerous to the people who live here now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2942)|
| 0:49:09| and to the future residents of the apartment complex that's planned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2949)|
| 0:49:17| With grading, the site distance, the way that the site distance is with grading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2957)|
| 0:49:25| will only make it safe up to 40 miles per hour, according to the traffic report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2965)|
| 0:49:31| But over half of the people who are traveling on Hollywood now are going faster than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2971)|
| 0:49:37| That's hundreds of chances for car accidents every single day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2977)|
| 0:49:42| It's very dangerous already for me to back out of my driveway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2982)|
| 0:49:46| or to try to back in so I can pull out straight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2986)|
| 0:49:50| Just with the existing traffic and with the speed that people travel, it's just really dangerous already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2990)|
| 0:49:57| You have a lot of children walking to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=2997)|
| 0:50:00| You have people who are driving that road every single day as a cut-through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3000)|
| 0:50:04| either to take their kids to West High School or going the other direction to get on the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3004)|
| 0:50:09| We've brought these issues up for at least 18 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3009)|
| 0:50:13| Nothing has been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3013)|
| 0:50:15| I don't know what can be done because I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3015)|
| 0:50:19| I've done a lot of reading, but I'm not an engineer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3019)|
| 0:50:22| I really don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3022)|
| 0:50:23| But we're really concerned about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3023)|
| 0:50:26| We're still concerned about flooding, which we understand will be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3026)|
| 0:50:31| We haven't seen any evidence that it has been addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3031)|
| 0:50:34| Nothing that I've read has shown that it's actually been addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3034)|
| 0:50:38| Also, several months ago, we brought up our concerns about a dangerous retaining wall that's crumbling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3038)|
| 0:50:44| I gave you all pictures so you could see what was happening, and nothing's been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3044)|
| 0:50:50| Every place I looked online, every person I asked has said that nothing has been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3050)|
| 0:50:55| So it shakes our confidence as a neighborhood when you tell us that it's going to be okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3055)|
| 0:51:05| and that traffic and flooding will be taken care of when we've already brought a serious situation to the council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3065)|
| 0:51:18| and nothing has been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3078)|
| 0:51:20| So we really hope that you will take our thoughts and take our concerns really seriously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3080)|
| 0:51:27| that before this is completely approved, that something is in place to deal with the traffic issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3087)|
| 0:51:35| Fine, Bill, but please make sure that before you give your consent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3095)|
| 0:51:41| you know for a fact that something can and will be done to make sure that we are safe driving on the street we live on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3101)|
| 0:51:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3109)|
| 0:51:50| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3110)|
| 0:51:52| Now we'll hear from Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3112)|
| 0:51:54| Mr. Shepard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3114)|
| 0:51:57| Could we switch?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3117)|
| 0:51:59| That's fine, whatever order you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3119)|
| 0:52:01| Mr. Shepard, thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3121)|
| 0:52:04| Please state your name and address for the record and keep an eye on the timer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3124)|
| 0:52:08| I'm John Shepard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3128)|
| 0:52:09| My address is 118 16th Avenue, South Nashville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3129)|
| 0:52:13| I'm here on behalf of Elmington Capital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3133)|
| 0:52:15| We're the developers of this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3135)|
| 0:52:17| And I want to first say how appreciative I am of our neighbors' passion and dedication for the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3137)|
| 0:52:25| It's something that's been a consistent theme,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3145)|
| 0:52:27| and it's one of the reasons why Pond Gap is such a great neighborhood is because you have so many people who are committed to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3147)|
| 0:52:34| And we are grateful to be a part of that, and we take that responsibility and carrying on that tradition seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3154)|
| 0:52:42| And we're appreciative of their specific feedback that we've gotten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3162)|
| 0:52:45| So we've held four community engagement meetings so far and have gotten important feedback at all of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3165)|
| 0:52:51| And frankly, it's made the development a better development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3171)|
| 0:52:54| They've definitely improved the development plan as a result of that feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3174)|
| 0:52:58| I'd just like to quickly go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3178)|
| 0:53:01| I'll try to hit seven main concerns that I've heard through the course of these meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3181)|
| 0:53:06| and how we intend to address each of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3186)|
| 0:53:10| In order, it's the pond, flooding, the density, traffic and safety, slopes, sidewalks, and schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3190)|
| 0:53:19| So the pond, first and foremost, we're preserving it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3199)|
| 0:53:22| We're not paving it over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3202)|
| 0:53:23| We're leaving it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3203)|
| 0:53:24| We're going to honor the pond with a historical marker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3204)|
| 0:53:27| Flooding, as was mentioned before, our development, well, actually, it may be counterintuitive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3207)|
| 0:53:32| but we'll make the flooding situation better, not worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3212)|
| 0:53:35| And that's because we're going to be required to install, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3215)|
| 0:53:38| very extensive subsurface stormwater detention measures, permeable pavers so that the water actually goes through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3218)|
| 0:53:46| even in our parking lots and places that appear to be, you know, just straight runoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3226)|
| 0:53:51| It'll actually soak underground and then not just get released into the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3231)|
| 0:53:55| The density, we have, in part, because of the feedback that we've received from the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3235)|
| 0:54:00| have reduced the proposed scale of this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3240)|
| 0:54:03| Our original rezoning application was for 30 units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3243)|
| 0:54:07| We reduced that to 24 units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3247)|
| 0:54:09| And then the final plan that was approved by MPC is actually for 20 units an acre, 102 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3249)|
| 0:54:16| And that is from a base zoning of C4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3256)|
| 0:54:19| So the zoning that was in place before the property was rezoned was C4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3259)|
| 0:54:23| which is one of the most permissive and, it should be noted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3263)|
| 0:54:26| traffic-intensive commercial zoning districts in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3266)|
| 0:54:30| On traffic and safety, we do have a traffic study that was performed by a licensed engineer, as required by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3270)|
| 0:54:39| The conclusions of that study were that the existing roads and interchanges are totally adequate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3279)|
| 0:54:45| to handle both the current traffic load as well as the increased traffic load as a result of the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3285)|
| 0:54:53| They grade level of service A to F, and I think the level of service was a C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3293)|
| 0:54:58| And that was generally unchanged as a result of the proposed development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3298)|
| 0:55:02| I think the average additional wait time at the Paper Mill and Sutherland traffic lights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3302)|
| 0:55:09| as a result of the development, was estimated to be something like two seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3309)|
| 0:55:14| And I don't like waiting in traffic any more than the next person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3314)|
| 0:55:17| but I don't think that two seconds additional wait is a very noticeable delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3317)|
| 0:55:23| Safety, we agree. There's people that drive far too fast on Hollywood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3323)|
| 0:55:28| And to that, I'd say a couple things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3328)|
| 0:55:30| First of all, having additional development, particularly development that abuts the street, helps slow down traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3330)|
| 0:55:37| I think the MPC would tell you that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3337)|
| 0:55:41| When people's lines of sight are more constrained as opposed to just seeing wide open, undeveloped land, they tend to slow down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3341)|
| 0:55:48| And so in that respect, we're actually, I think, going to improve that situation to a certain extent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3348)|
| 0:55:53| And even if you don't believe that that's true, I think that, as was mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3353)|
| 0:56:00| there's going to be kids walking to school at Pond Gap Elementary School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3360)|
| 0:56:03| and they're going to be walking regardless of whether or not our apartment complex is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3363)|
| 0:56:07| So I think that what we want to do is not shape land use decisions around saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3367)|
| 0:56:12| there's people at speed here, and that's just how it's going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3372)|
| 0:56:15| I think we need to figure out how to address those enforcement issues and slow people down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3375)|
| 0:56:19| because whether or not the project goes forward, those kids are still going to be walking to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3379)|
| 0:56:25| And we support further traffic calming measures, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3385)|
| 0:56:28| In our plans is an elevated crosswalk across Hollywood Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3388)|
| 0:56:32| which will have signage and the stripes in the pavement and should help slow things down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3392)|
| 0:56:38| On slopes, we're setting aside half the site in the hillside protection area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3398)|
| 0:56:42| which would not be required under the base zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3402)|
| 0:56:45| We're building sidewalks along the periphery of our property and adding to the sidewalk network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3405)|
| 0:56:51| And in schools, we've spoken with Principal McGill of Pond Gap Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3411)|
| 0:56:56| We've estimated the additional school load as a result of the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3416)|
| 0:57:02| The conclusion is that it's adequate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3422)|
| 0:57:04| The schools have the capacity to handle those additional students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3424)|
| 0:57:07| and that they're excited to have them in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3427)|
| 0:57:11| So we believe these are good faith efforts to address these concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3431)|
| 0:57:14| and the development as proposed will be an appropriate addition to the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3434)|
| 0:57:19| and beneficial to our neighbors and the community as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3439)|
| 0:57:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3444)|
| 0:57:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3445)|
| 0:57:27| Now Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3447)|
| 0:57:30| I second what Mr. Shepard is saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3450)|
| 0:57:32| You're seconding it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3452)|
| 0:57:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3453)|
| 0:57:34| We'll accept that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3454)|
| 0:57:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3455)|
| 0:57:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3458)|
| 0:57:39| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3459)|
| 0:57:41| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3461)|
| 0:57:42| Director Green, I guess I'll start with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3462)|
| 0:57:45| There were nine conditions when we last met that MPC was to consider during the use on review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3465)|
| 0:57:52| Could you go through, I guess, what MPC's discussions were about that, about those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3472)|
| 0:58:00| The Metropolitan Planning Commission approved the use on review subject to 12 conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3480)|
| 0:58:07| and those 12 conditions addressed pedestrian safety, installation of sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3487)|
| 0:58:12| preservation of the steep slope, landscaping, the construction of the mid-block crossing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3492)|
| 0:58:20| the crosswalk because the existing sidewalk is on the east side of Hollywood Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3500)|
| 0:58:30| and their development is on the west side, compliance with the basic standards of the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3510)|
| 0:58:37| We tried with, and there was one additional condition added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3517)|
| 0:58:42| The initial landscaping condition addressed landscaping around the periphery of the site on the north side of the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3522)|
| 0:58:53| and the condition requested by the Planning Commissioner was that landscaping be provided in front of the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3533)|
| 0:59:00| to soften the mass of the building and to further, as Mr. Shepard said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3540)|
| 0:59:06| create that limited line of sight along the Hollywood Road within that area to hopefully,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3546)|
| 0:59:15| through a psychological approach, slow traffic down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3555)|
| 0:59:20| And I guess I understand the 12 points you were talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3560)|
| 0:59:27| I'm talking about the nine points that I had emailed to you and I had expressed during the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3567)|
| 0:59:33| Some of those are duplicate, but what we were hearing tonight was concerns about the impact on traffic and safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3573)|
| 0:59:42| So I wanted to specifically ask you about how MPC addressed those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3582)|
| 0:59:46| As Mr. Shepard alluded to, MPC required a traffic study for the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3586)|
| 0:59:52| That traffic study analyzed the existing traffic, projected the basic growth in traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3592)|
| 1:00:01| and then added the traffic that would be generated by the proposed development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3601)|
| 1:00:05| The traffic study concluded that there were no needs for turn lanes, no improvements to the road that would be needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3605)|
| 1:00:12| in order to accommodate the traffic that would be generated by the proposed development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3612)|
| 1:00:17| And that was one of them, was consideration of a deceleration lane and turn lane to improve traffic and safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3617)|
| 1:00:22| And the traffic study stated that the warrants weren't there to justify the turn lane and decel lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3622)|
| 1:00:28| What about the consideration for site distance as impacted by the hills with regard to traffic and safety?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3628)|
| 1:00:34| The traffic study recommends that some grading and some clearing of vegetation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3634)|
| 1:00:38| and states that with those actions, the site distance required at this location would be met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3638)|
| 1:00:46| The other that we talked about and Elmington discussed as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3646)|
| 1:00:51| and was brought up by the neighborhood today was the impact on water flow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3651)|
| 1:00:55| And again, that condition is addressed in the compliance with the standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3655)|
| 1:01:00| that there be compliance of the project with the standards of the Knoxville Department of Engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3660)|
| 1:01:05| especially the stormwater standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3665)|
| 1:01:07| Those standards will address the water flowing off the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3667)|
| 1:01:11| And as Mr. Shepherd said, the development has possibly exceeded the city's standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3671)|
| 1:01:17| by proposing permeable paving as well as underground storage for stormwater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3677)|
| 1:01:23| to ensure that the rate of flow does not exceed that prior to the development of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3683)|
| 1:01:30| Okay. And I'm just remembering that at the NPC meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3690)|
| 1:01:35| there was some discussion about a deceleration lane or a turn lane, but it didn't end up in a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3695)|
| 1:01:42| But there was some discussion about that. Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3702)|
| 1:01:44| That's correct. And there are varying lines of thought about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3704)|
| 1:01:48| Again, the traffic study stated that one was not warranted based on the traffic generated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3708)|
| 1:01:54| What works well to slow down traffic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3714)|
| 1:01:58| Somebody turning left and there's no way to get around them, to be quite frank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3718)|
| 1:02:02| Is that a safe way to slow down traffic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3722)|
| 1:02:05| That's open to argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3725)|
| 1:02:07| Is it better to have a turn lane and allow traffic to speed around the left turn traffic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3727)|
| 1:02:12| That's, again, a subjective question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3732)|
| 1:02:16| I would think that the turn lane traffic turning left, stopping, would slow down traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3736)|
| 1:02:24| The pedestrian, raised pedestrian crosswalk also tends to slow down traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3744)|
| 1:02:29| So I think there are some measures that we do hope will calm the traffic somewhat on the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3749)|
| 1:02:36| and result in less speeding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3756)|
| 1:02:38| Okay. Thank you, Director Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3758)|
| 1:02:40| Director Hagerman, I've got some questions for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3760)|
| 1:02:44| We just talked about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3764)|
| 1:02:46| There was some discussion at Council as well as at MPC about a turn lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3766)|
| 1:02:51| Do you think a turn lane is warranted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3771)|
| 1:02:54| Jim Hagerman, Director of Engineering for the City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3774)|
| 1:02:58| Formally, it's not warranted. It's not required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3778)|
| 1:03:04| And as Mr. Green was saying, not having a turn lane may be a way to slow down traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3784)|
| 1:03:16| Having a turn lane might marginally speed up traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3796)|
| 1:03:21| I mean, might reduce delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3801)|
| 1:03:25| It wouldn't make it go faster, but it could reduce delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3805)|
| 1:03:30| It is right on the edge of the area that would require the traffic volume existing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3810)|
| 1:03:39| Well, the projected traffic volume is right on the edge of where we would require a turn lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3819)|
| 1:03:44| but it is outside that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3824)|
| 1:03:46| So it is kind of a judgment call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3826)|
| 1:03:49| Okay. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3829)|
| 1:03:52| I noticed on Kingston Pike that there's an electronic sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3832)|
| 1:03:57| that lets the driver know how fast they're driving as they're approaching a residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3837)|
| 1:04:03| It probably has a radar in it and flashes up how fast you're going relative to the speed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3843)|
| 1:04:10| And I don't mean to put you on the spot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3850)|
| 1:04:12| but obviously I can't have conversations about this in the quasi-judicial role that it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3852)|
| 1:04:17| but I wanted to ask you if you know about how much a sign like that would cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3857)|
| 1:04:25| I don't. I don't know how much they cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3865)|
| 1:04:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3868)|
| 1:04:30| They're not cheap, but depending on the context, they may be worth it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3870)|
| 1:04:36| Okay. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3876)|
| 1:04:38| Is that something that can impact slowing traffic down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3878)|
| 1:04:44| My limited amount of experience with them is, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3884)|
| 1:04:48| the particular signs on Kingston Pike do record the speed of traffic going by,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3888)|
| 1:04:56| and my limited analysis of the numbers indicates that they've had minimal effect on speeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3896)|
| 1:05:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3908)|
| 1:05:09| In the traffic study, it does call for a stop sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3909)|
| 1:05:12| Is that something that's going to be required?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3912)|
| 1:05:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3914)|
| 1:05:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3915)|
| 1:05:16| That's just the stop sign at the driveway, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3916)|
| 1:05:19| Yeah, at the exit, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3919)|
| 1:05:23| If this council was to agree that traffic and safety need to be addressed on Hollywood Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3923)|
| 1:05:30| does this development significantly worsen the present conditions on Hollywood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3930)|
| 1:05:39| Not significantly, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3939)|
| 1:05:44| If this council was to approve this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3944)|
| 1:05:50| would your office be willing to hold a public meeting with the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3950)|
| 1:05:53| to discuss potential improvements on Hollywood that would focus on traffic and safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3953)|
| 1:06:00| following the issuance of certificates of occupancy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3960)|
| 1:06:03| We would be happy to meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3963)|
| 1:06:05| We've been in discussion with them, as one of the previous speakers said, for 18 years or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3965)|
| 1:06:13| We have taken a pretty hard look at what could be done there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3973)|
| 1:06:18| There are constraints in terms of the nature of the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3978)|
| 1:06:23| and the amount it would cost to make significant changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3983)|
| 1:06:29| And just, yeah, just the nature of the setting makes it difficult to do much different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3989)|
| 1:06:36| Well, and I can appreciate that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3996)|
| 1:06:38| but I think one of the things that we're hearing from the neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=3998)|
| 1:06:41| is that there's a lot of concern about, obviously, traffic and safety on this road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4001)|
| 1:06:47| And I think maybe having a public meeting where we could have a discussion about what could be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4007)|
| 1:06:55| might be fruitful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4015)|
| 1:06:57| Okay, yeah, we'd certainly be willing to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4017)|
| 1:07:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4020)|
| 1:07:01| Let me turn to Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4021)|
| 1:07:04| And I don't know if Mr. Shepard wants to speak to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4024)|
| 1:07:09| but I wanted to ask what it would take in your design to add a turn lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4029)|
| 1:07:26| I can't answer that off the top of my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4046)|
| 1:07:29| That's not something that I don't believe that we've analyzed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4049)|
| 1:07:32| because it's never been a requirement that's been proposed by the engineering department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4052)|
| 1:07:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4058)|
| 1:07:39| Is that something you would consider doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4059)|
| 1:07:43| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4063)|
| 1:07:45| I mean, if it's feasible to build and beneficial to traffic and safety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4065)|
| 1:07:51| we would consider building it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4071)|
| 1:07:56| It's a fairly constrained site in terms of topography and in terms of size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4076)|
| 1:08:03| So I don't know how feasible that would be, but I would certainly be open to considering it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4083)|
| 1:08:08| What about the electronic sign that gives information about how fast you're traveling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4088)|
| 1:08:14| and warns drivers of their speed over the limit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4094)|
| 1:08:19| We would love to have that there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4099)|
| 1:08:21| I mean, I don't want to accept the obligation to pay for something that I don't know how much it costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4101)|
| 1:08:29| And also because we're talking about presumably people who are speeding coming from somewhere else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4109)|
| 1:08:36| heading somewhere else, who don't live at our property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4116)|
| 1:08:39| who don't have anything to do with our development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4119)|
| 1:08:42| So I'm reluctant to start sort of taking on unlimited public infrastructure expenses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4122)|
| 1:08:49| for burdens that don't really have anything to do with this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4129)|
| 1:08:56| But I would certainly be happy to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4136)|
| 1:08:58| I mean, we are building sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4138)|
| 1:09:00| And so it may be something where since we're already building a sidewalk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4140)|
| 1:09:03| there's an opportunity to situate that within that new sidewalk area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4143)|
| 1:09:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4147)|
| 1:09:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4148)|
| 1:09:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4149)|
| 1:09:10| And then just finally, I wanted to mention a few things to the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4150)|
| 1:09:16| I know that many of you had reached out to me here recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4156)|
| 1:09:21| And as I had stated earlier, counsel is in a quasi-judicial role here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4161)|
| 1:09:26| so it's improper for me to talk to either side during, I guess, as we're going through the appeal process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4166)|
| 1:09:33| So I know we've had pretty frequent conversation up to that point when the appeal was filed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4173)|
| 1:09:38| And I know that Mr. Frost had actually reached out to some of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4178)|
| 1:09:41| and let you know maybe why I wasn't able to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4181)|
| 1:09:44| But I wanted you to know that I need to follow what the longstanding law is here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4184)|
| 1:09:53| and I do apologize for not being able to reach out to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4193)|
| 1:09:57| You know, we've had many conversations in counsel about how important affordable housing is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4197)|
| 1:10:08| And, you know, I'm in support of this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4208)|
| 1:10:11| But at the same time, I think it's important for us to review what has been done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4211)|
| 1:10:18| regarding the concerns that the neighborhood has voiced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4218)|
| 1:10:22| Per that request, we've reduced the land use from RP2 to RP1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4222)|
| 1:10:27| Per the neighborhood's request, MPC was directed to consider nine conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4227)|
| 1:10:32| during the use on review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4232)|
| 1:10:34| We've reviewed those again this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4234)|
| 1:10:37| Per the neighborhood's request, we had a meeting that was arranged between Emlington| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4237)|
| 1:10:41| and the neighborhood prior to the MPC review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4241)|
| 1:10:45| We had professional traffic engineers that were required to study the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4245)|
| 1:10:50| And I just want to say to the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4250)|
| 1:10:52| I agree with you that traffic and safety are legitimate concerns along Hollywood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4252)|
| 1:10:57| We heard tonight that Director Hagerman is willing to hold a public meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4257)|
| 1:11:01| to address those concerns on Hollywood, and I will make sure that we set that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4261)|
| 1:11:08| And I just want to take a minute and thank you, members of the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4268)|
| 1:11:12| for, you know, all of the efforts that you've put through on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4272)|
| 1:11:18| I think, actually, your efforts here have really made for a better project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4278)|
| 1:11:27| And so I know it may not feel like you're getting what you want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4287)|
| 1:11:33| but I think that these issues have been addressed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4293)|
| 1:11:36| and I do thank you for all of your work on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4296)|
| 1:11:41| And I will continue to work with you on trying to do whatever we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4301)|
| 1:11:45| to improve the situation on Hollywood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4305)|
| 1:11:48| I'll let my other colleagues, since I've taken up all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4308)|
| 1:11:53| Councilwoman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4313)|
| 1:11:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4315)|
| 1:11:56| Mr. Shepherd, I just want to make sure that I'm clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4316)|
| 1:11:59| You mentioned that there were seven topics or seven points in the meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4319)|
| 1:12:03| and I may have missed some, but I had the pond, flooding density, traffic safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4323)|
| 1:12:08| Did you mention two additional ones?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4328)|
| 1:12:11| Slopes, sidewalks, and schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4331)|
| 1:12:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4333)|
| 1:12:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4334)|
| 1:12:15| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4335)|
| 1:12:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4336)|
| 1:12:17| That was my question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4337)|
| 1:12:18| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4338)|
| 1:12:19| And so it does appear that most of these that you have, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4339)|
| 1:12:22| provided adequate information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4342)|
| 1:12:24| and there's been a lot of discussion as far as the preservation of the pond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4344)|
| 1:12:27| the improvement for the flooding, the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4347)|
| 1:12:30| Again, as Councilmember Roberto mentioned, traffic and safety I think is paramount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4350)|
| 1:12:35| and I do think that there needs to be more due diligence as it relates to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4355)|
| 1:12:39| I'm by far no expert from a traffic engineering perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4359)|
| 1:12:42| but I have recently been frequenting the Southerland Hollywood areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4362)|
| 1:12:49| and I know that the streets are very narrow there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4369)|
| 1:12:51| There's not, you know, there's no opportunity to widen the streets there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4371)|
| 1:12:55| But traffic is currently a concern at certain times of the day as it relates to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4375)|
| 1:13:02| And so I was concerned to initially hear that there were no improvements, per se,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4382)|
| 1:13:10| that were recommended or a turning lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4390)|
| 1:13:12| even at least with the consideration of going into the new complex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4392)|
| 1:13:17| which I do think needs to be reconsidered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4397)|
| 1:13:20| As I said, currently as it stands, there is quite a bit of traffic on those roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4400)|
| 1:13:26| and the addition of these, you know, housing units, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4406)|
| 1:13:31| will of course add significant additional traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4411)|
| 1:13:34| even though, you know, we say that it's going to be a C,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4414)|
| 1:13:38| but can we do better than a C as it relates to the people who already reside in the neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4418)|
| 1:13:43| And they have been, in my opinion, more than gracious in coming to the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4423)|
| 1:13:48| and working through this as they, again, stated that they are not against affordable housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4428)|
| 1:13:54| and would welcome it in their neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4434)|
| 1:13:56| But, again, it should not be at the expense of the current residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4436)|
| 1:13:59| as far as the traffic and safety is concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4439)|
| 1:14:02| So I do appreciate your clarification, and you working with them as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4442)|
| 1:14:06| I think there's been a lot of, I think, concessions and collaboration there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4446)|
| 1:14:11| but I just agree that we need to have some additional work as it relates to the safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4451)|
| 1:14:19| and the traffic as far as that's concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4459)|
| 1:14:22| So thank you very much for sharing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4462)|
| 1:14:25| One additional thing, and Deputy Brace, I think I need to direct this to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4465)|
| 1:14:31| Mr. Shepard, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4471)|
| 1:14:33| As it relates to the retaining wall, I know that we spoke about that previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4473)|
| 1:14:37| Please correct me if I'm wrong that the retaining wall that is in question is private property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4477)|
| 1:14:43| However, in the past, the city has repaired that property because it was falling over into the sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4483)|
| 1:14:52| Could you tell me what that means as it relates to a retaining wall on private property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4492)|
| 1:14:58| and whose responsibility is it to maintain that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4498)|
| 1:15:02| Yes, I can answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4502)|
| 1:15:04| So when we have retaining walls, typically the first thing we do is go out and look at the wall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4504)|
| 1:15:09| and we've done that in numerous situations in the city, and Peter and I will look at this again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4509)|
| 1:15:15| We oftentimes bring in city engineering to determine whether or not it is a city facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4515)|
| 1:15:20| or a private facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4520)|
| 1:15:21| If it's a city facility, we will repair it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4521)|
| 1:15:23| If it's a private facility, then we give notice to the owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4523)|
| 1:15:26| just like any other maintenance issue on a piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4526)|
| 1:15:29| and the owner will have a certain amount of time to take corrective action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4529)|
| 1:15:33| If they are unable to take corrective action, then we would go in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4533)|
| 1:15:37| Typically, we will go in, remove the wall, and slope back the yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4537)|
| 1:15:42| We work with engineering and law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4542)|
| 1:15:44| Retaining walls, they can be a little tricky because obviously we want to take care of the immediate issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4544)|
| 1:15:51| but we also want to do it in a way that doesn't open us up to a liability perspective from the yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4551)|
| 1:15:58| But oftentimes, if we have an individual that financially cannot address a retaining wall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4558)|
| 1:16:03| that can be expensive, we will remove the wall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4563)|
| 1:16:06| and we will slope back or peel back the wall enough that we can, excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4566)|
| 1:16:10| the soil that a retaining wall is no longer needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4570)|
| 1:16:13| So Mr. Ahrens and I will look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4573)|
| 1:16:15| I'll look at it tomorrow, and I know Mr. Moyers has been out to this site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4575)|
| 1:16:20| so I'll talk with Mr. Moyers, and we'll see where this one is in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4580)|
| 1:16:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4584)|
| 1:16:25| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4585)|
| 1:16:26| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4586)|
| 1:16:27| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4587)|
| 1:16:30| I think there are concerns that I'm satisfied with the answers that the concerns have been given,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4590)|
| 1:16:35| and I move to deny this appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4595)|
| 1:16:38| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4598)|
| 1:16:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4599)|
| 1:16:40| So we have a motion and a second to deny the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4600)|
| 1:16:43| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4603)|
| 1:16:46| We've had quite a bit already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4606)|
| 1:16:48| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4608)|
| 1:16:49| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4609)|
| 1:16:50| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4610)|
| 1:16:51| The motion to deny the appeal passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4611)|
| 1:16:58| I'll move on to resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4618)|
| 1:17:01| 11A is a resolution authorizing the Mayor to execute and deliver on behalf of the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4621)|
| 1:17:06| all documents necessary to transfer to Knoxville's Housing Development Corporation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4626)|
| 1:17:10| several parcels of real property located on Clifton Road, Sanderson Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4630)|
| 1:17:15| and Chillicothe Street at no cost for the development of affordable rental housing for seniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4635)|
| 1:17:21| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4641)|
| 1:17:22| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4642)|
| 1:17:23| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4643)|
| 1:17:24| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4644)|
| 1:17:25| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4645)|
| 1:17:26| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4646)|
| 1:17:27| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4647)|
| 1:17:29| 11B is a resolution authorizing the Mayor to execute any and all documents necessary to award| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4649)|
| 1:17:35| $1,200,000 in affordable rental development funds to Knoxville's Housing Development Corporation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4655)|
| 1:17:41| for the development of 53 affordable housing units for low-income seniors to be located on Clifton Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4661)|
| 1:17:47| and Chillicothe Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4667)|
| 1:17:49| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4669)|
| 1:17:50| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4670)|
| 1:17:51| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4671)|
| 1:17:54| So, I think Brad Peters and KCDC Ben Bentley are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4674)|
| 1:18:00| I just had a couple questions about we're approving tonight $1.2 million subsidy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4680)|
| 1:18:06| and I want to talk about the cost of the project and how this subsidy was applied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4686)|
| 1:18:11| and how it was applied for and how it was given and the reasons and the merits behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4691)|
| 1:18:21| Becky Wade sent over some of that information today, but I kind of want to talk a little bit about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4701)|
| 1:18:26| I think it's important to understand the scope of the project, the cost of the project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4706)|
| 1:18:31| and exactly how $1.2 million was applied to it and what it's for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4711)|
| 1:18:35| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4715)|
| 1:18:36| Thank you for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4716)|
| 1:18:37| Also, thank you for allowing me to come back up here given my previous comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4717)|
| 1:18:41| The podium comes up if you don't want to bend over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4721)|
| 1:18:42| Oh, you're forgiven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4722)|
| 1:18:50| Very nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4730)|
| 1:18:51| Glad to see that being used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4731)|
| 1:18:53| So, a little bit about there are some distinctions, and I'm not going to get too much in the weeds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4733)|
| 1:18:57| on affordable housing finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4737)|
| 1:18:59| I know you all would be captivated by that topic, but there are some distinctions between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4739)|
| 1:19:03| what a private developer can do and what somebody like KCDC can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4743)|
| 1:19:07| So, they would have the ability or more ability than we do to be able to raise equity from a private background,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4747)|
| 1:19:13| so they might have investors that come into these deals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4753)|
| 1:19:16| For a project like the 53 units at Clifton Road, we have been successful in applying for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4756)|
| 1:19:22| and receiving a Tennessee Housing Development Agency grant in the amount of approximately $900,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4762)|
| 1:19:27| We've received a grant from the Federal Home Loan Bank for another $900,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4767)|
| 1:19:32| We're making the request to the city for $1.2 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4772)|
| 1:19:35| and then we're also using something called a community investment tax credit loan from Home Federal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4775)|
| 1:19:41| which is a prime minus four loan that is specifically for the purposes of development of affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4781)|
| 1:19:46| So, we've really cobbled together a number of sources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4786)|
| 1:19:50| There's also project-based vouchers, which is a resource that HUD allows us to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4790)|
| 1:19:54| It's sort of an ongoing operating subsidy that gives Home Federal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4794)|
| 1:19:58| or whatever the lending institution is some confidence that we'll be able to repay the loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4798)|
| 1:20:03| In terms of a debt service coverage ratio, if we were a private developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4803)|
| 1:20:08| we would probably be looking at something $1.2 to $1.3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4808)|
| 1:20:12| We're a bit more of a conservative organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4812)|
| 1:20:15| You know, we take our responsibility with public dollars very seriously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4815)|
| 1:20:20| so we try to keep that number around $1.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4820)|
| 1:20:24| The beauty of that higher debt service coverage ratio is we feel confident| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4824)|
| 1:20:27| that our properties are going to be sustainable financially for the long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4827)|
| 1:20:31| The other benefit is if we do end up cash-flowing that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4831)|
| 1:20:35| I can assure you what we're going to do is turn around and reinvest in more affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4835)|
| 1:20:40| So, there's a little bit of a distinction between the way we analyze that type of property and that project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4840)|
| 1:20:45| and what maybe a private developer would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4845)|
| 1:20:47| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4847)|
| 1:20:49| It makes sense to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4849)|
| 1:20:50| So, what's the total cost of the project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4850)|
| 1:20:52| It is, and this is where I may need to call Brad Peters to come up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4852)|
| 1:20:55| because it's right around $6 million, but he'll have, like, the number down to the dollar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4855)|
| 1:21:14| It's $5.673 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4874)|
| 1:21:21| And 53 units, so a little more than 100,000 a unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4881)|
| 1:21:25| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4885)|
| 1:21:26| And I just think that's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4886)|
| 1:21:28| But the $1.2 million that you're asking the city for is not an arbitrary number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4888)|
| 1:21:34| I mean, you came by it by, you didn't just ask for $1.2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4894)|
| 1:21:40| You needed that, is what we look for in TIFs or Pilots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4900)|
| 1:21:46| I mean, it's a but-for number, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4906)|
| 1:21:48| I mean, you needed this money to make it cash flow, and you cover your debt service with the rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4908)|
| 1:21:53| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4913)|
| 1:21:55| And that's documented in the agreement that, well, I guess we got late this afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4915)|
| 1:22:00| or the proposal we got, or part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4920)|
| 1:22:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4923)|
| 1:22:05| If you would like, she can fill in on exactly how she does that analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4925)|
| 1:22:10| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4930)|
| 1:22:11| Yeah, if you've got a quick comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4931)|
| 1:22:13| I'll add a little context to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4933)|
| 1:22:15| So typically the way we would do it is we would say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4935)|
| 1:22:18| so from that debt service coverage ratio that we're trying to hit, you know, that'll support this much debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4938)|
| 1:22:24| It might be $3 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4944)|
| 1:22:26| And then beyond that, we're trying to fill that gap in grant funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4946)|
| 1:22:30| So we've been successful on the two grants to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4950)|
| 1:22:33| Hopefully we're successful tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4953)|
| 1:22:35| But there's only so many grants that are available out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4955)|
| 1:22:38| and we've hit on two of the three that are in that universe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4958)|
| 1:22:43| So there aren't any other additional funding sources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4963)|
| 1:22:46| So without the $1.2 million tonight, we would have to go back to the drawing board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4966)|
| 1:22:50| and either consider taking on debt that typically we wouldn't be comfortable with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4970)|
| 1:22:55| but would potentially be allowable, or we would have to go and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4975)|
| 1:22:59| scrape under some rocks and see if there's some other grant funding available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4979)|
| 1:23:02| And these are modular units like you built in Five Points, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4982)|
| 1:23:05| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4985)|
| 1:23:06| So we've done some of these built by Clayton in Five Points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4986)|
| 1:23:09| and had very good success in terms of durability and just the quality of the living environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4989)|
| 1:23:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4994)|
| 1:23:15| That's really all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4995)|
| 1:23:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4996)|
| 1:23:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4997)|
| 1:23:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4998)|
| 1:23:19| You're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=4999)|
| 1:23:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5000)|
| 1:23:21| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5001)|
| 1:23:22| Mr. Bentley, I just wanted to ask a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5002)|
| 1:23:25| So after the project is completed and residents move in, the bills, the debt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5005)|
| 1:23:31| is paid for by rent, some of which are vouchers, and some of it is paid by the tenants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5011)|
| 1:23:38| How is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5018)|
| 1:23:39| Yeah, so the tenant would pay 30 percent of their gross income in any given month toward rent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5019)|
| 1:23:45| and there's something called project-based vouchers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5025)|
| 1:23:47| So we can take a portion of our tenant-based vouchers and apply them to specific units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5027)|
| 1:23:53| So HUD will subsidize that total rent, so they'll pay the difference in what the tenant's able to pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5033)|
| 1:23:59| and what the normal rent for that unit might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5039)|
| 1:24:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5041)|
| 1:24:02| And of the need that you see in our community, or maybe our community reflects others as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5042)|
| 1:24:09| It's average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5049)|
| 1:24:10| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5050)|
| 1:24:11| How many are seniors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5051)|
| 1:24:13| How many are not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5053)|
| 1:24:15| What's the makeup of need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5055)|
| 1:24:17| Yeah, we have an extensive waiting list at all of our senior properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5057)|
| 1:24:20| So there's thousands of people on waiting lists that need affordable housing, particularly in that senior group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5060)|
| 1:24:26| We know from 2010 to 2017 that demographic has increased by 23 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5066)|
| 1:24:31| That's a nationwide statistic, but in Knoxville that's not any different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5071)|
| 1:24:35| and we're going to continue to see growth in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5075)|
| 1:24:37| So we would love to do more projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5077)|
| 1:24:39| There's definitely demand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5079)|
| 1:24:41| To me, it's one of those things that may be such a no-brainer that you can take a lot of time trying to quantify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5081)|
| 1:24:46| exactly what the demand is, but the truth is we know it exists and it's significant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5086)|
| 1:24:50| so we're trying to do something about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5090)|
| 1:24:52| So the choice to do particularly this project for seniors versus all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5092)|
| 1:24:56| is based on looking at wait lists and how many people are in need in a particular demographic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5096)|
| 1:25:03| Absolutely, based on the demographic changes in our wait lists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5103)|
| 1:25:06| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5106)|
| 1:25:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5107)|
| 1:25:08| Councilwoman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5108)|
| 1:25:10| Mr. Bentley, question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5110)|
| 1:25:12| On the affordability aspect where it says here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5112)|
| 1:25:15| for a period of 20 years beginning on the date construction of all units on the property is completed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5115)|
| 1:25:20| the affordability period, all assisted rental units in the property will be occupied only by households| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5120)|
| 1:25:25| that are eligible as low-income families and will meet the requirements to qualify as affordable housing set forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5125)|
| 1:25:31| Could you speak specifically to what that means, the 20-year period?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5131)|
| 1:25:36| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5136)|
| 1:25:37| The 20-year period, that's language that THDA, the Federal Home Loan Bank,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5137)|
| 1:25:41| and the Project-Based Voucher Program use in terms of a timeline for affordability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5141)|
| 1:25:45| So applied to a private developer's project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5145)|
| 1:25:48| they would only be on the hook for that 20-year affordability period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5148)|
| 1:25:51| From a KCDC standpoint, we're going to keep those affordable into perpetuity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5151)|
| 1:25:55| So what that would look like is we would go back in in 20 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5155)|
| 1:25:58| reapplying for some of these same sources of funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5158)|
| 1:26:01| assuming they're available, and rehabbing those units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5161)|
| 1:26:04| So does that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5164)|
| 1:26:06| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5166)|
| 1:26:07| I just needed a point of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5167)|
| 1:26:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5168)|
| 1:26:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5169)|
| 1:26:10| Thank you, Mr. Bentley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5170)|
| 1:26:12| Okay, Council, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5172)|

| 1:28:57| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5337)|
| 1:28:58| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5338)|
| 1:28:59| Okay, Council, we have three people signed up to speak about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5339)|
| 1:29:04| Mark Hines, James Taylor, and Lisa Zeni.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5344)|
| 1:29:07| Do you have any order you want?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5347)|
| 1:29:09| Lisa, you want to go ahead and start with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5349)|
| 1:29:13| Again, please state your name and address for the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5353)|
| 1:29:16| and keep an eye on the timer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5356)|
| 1:29:17| If I might, let me make a disclosure before Ms. Zeni talks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5357)|
| 1:29:22| I am a member of the board of the Arts and Cultural Alliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5362)|
| 1:29:26| I just want people to know that it presents no conflict| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5366)|
| 1:29:29| because I've received no compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5369)|
| 1:29:31| I just wanted to get that out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5371)|
| 1:29:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5373)|
| 1:29:34| Ms. Zeni, please, again, state your name and address for the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5374)|
| 1:29:38| and watch the timer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5378)|
| 1:29:40| Lisa Zeni, not the city jail today, 113 Baylor Drive, Oak Ridge, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5380)|
| 1:29:48| I work at the Arts and Cultural Alliance at the Emporium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5388)|
| 1:29:51| and I also am the staff liaison for the Public Arts Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5391)|
| 1:29:56| Do we have any questions about what's in front of you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5396)|
| 1:29:59| I don't think we have anybody speaking against the resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5399)|
| 1:30:04| but if you would like me to explain anything and speak for it, I'm happy to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5404)|
| 1:30:09| We're basically here if there's any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5409)|
| 1:30:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5411)|
| 1:30:12| Is that the same?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5412)|
| 1:30:13| Do Mr. Taylor and Mr. Hines, they want to speak about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5413)|
| 1:30:16| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5416)|
| 1:30:17| For questions or they want to give a presentation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5417)|
| 1:30:19| I think just for questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5419)|
| 1:30:21| Okay, they're members of the Public Arts Committee as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5421)|
| 1:30:24| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5424)|
| 1:30:26| Okay, so then we will see if Council has questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5426)|
| 1:30:30| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5430)|
| 1:30:31| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5431)|
| 1:30:33| A couple of questions I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5433)|
| 1:30:35| What we're asked to approve tonight is the cost of the art.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5435)|
| 1:30:40| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5440)|
| 1:30:42| What's the cost of the total development, so for the rest of the park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5442)|
| 1:30:46| for the rest of the landscaping, and how will we pay for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5446)|
| 1:30:49| and where will that come from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5449)|
| 1:30:51| This money has been the money for the artwork has been saved over the years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5451)|
| 1:30:56| from allocations from the general fund, so it's already been approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5456)|
| 1:31:00| I think it's the same thing for the landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5460)|
| 1:31:02| I think there's about $400,000 plus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5462)|
| 1:31:05| There's $400,000 that has been assigned to the landscaping, the park space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5465)|
| 1:31:10| concrete work, lighting, electrical, so that money is budgeted, has been budgeted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5470)|
| 1:31:14| and that work will be through the procurement process and a professional designer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5474)|
| 1:31:21| Landscape civil work would be engaged and a contract would come before Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5481)|
| 1:31:26| So you think the rest of that, the second half of that will be about $400,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5486)|
| 1:31:30| That's what's budgeted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5490)|
| 1:31:31| So obviously the scope of work for those design professionals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5491)|
| 1:31:35| and the expectations will drive that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5495)|
| 1:31:38| Again, it's the structural concrete and then the landscaping and lighting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5498)|
| 1:31:42| and electrical that would go into supporting the art piece that has been selected by the group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5502)|
| 1:31:49| by the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5509)|
| 1:31:50| So this is a real interactive, unlike art that I might be familiar with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5510)|
| 1:31:55| an unknowledgeable person, this is art that actually will be of use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5515)|
| 1:32:00| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5520)|
| 1:32:01| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5521)|
| 1:32:03| This design is amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5523)|
| 1:32:07| It was created, Mayor Rojero attended the day-long presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5527)|
| 1:32:14| You can't really tell from the pictures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5534)|
| 1:32:16| but the design of the piece itself reflects the topography, the mountains of our region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5536)|
| 1:32:24| When we asked the artist to explain where did you get the inspiration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5544)|
| 1:32:28| I was blown away because he could say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5548)|
| 1:32:31| well, here are the Smoky Mountains, here is the impression,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5551)|
| 1:32:36| and you can look here, there's Meade's Quarry, and over here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5556)|
| 1:32:39| if you really look long enough, you can see parts of the Tennessee River going through here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5559)|
| 1:32:45| There's a very musicality of the whole thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5565)|
| 1:32:48| It really is a hand-created piece that reflects who we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5568)|
| 1:32:57| And I think that's the beauty of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5577)|
| 1:32:59| Not only will light pass through it and play,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5579)|
| 1:33:03| the dappling of the shadows that children will play in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5583)|
| 1:33:08| but also it will change from morning to evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5588)|
| 1:33:12| It will change in the fall and in the winter because of the light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5592)|
| 1:33:16| And the space that this piece actually creates is a gathering space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5596)|
| 1:33:22| It draws people who would ordinarily just walk by this land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5602)|
| 1:33:27| who do walk by it all the time and pay no attention to it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5607)|
| 1:33:30| It is designed to pull them in and to pull them to the end of the pier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5610)|
| 1:33:37| where they're looking out east, you know, onto the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5617)|
| 1:33:41| onto East Knoxville, onto the mountains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5621)|
| 1:33:43| And there's a place there for people to sit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5623)|
| 1:33:49| Senior citizens can enjoy the sun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5629)|
| 1:33:51| Musicians can play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5631)|
| 1:33:53| Children can, you know, like I said, dance with the dappled light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5633)|
| 1:34:02| I think it's a place that it transforms that piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5642)|
| 1:34:07| into a place that people will live in and visit again and again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5647)|
| 1:34:13| That's the beauty of that piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5653)|
| 1:34:15| I never thought you could sell snow to Eskimos, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5655)|
| 1:34:17| I mean, that was beautiful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5657)|
| 1:34:19| I mean, that was quite a, you know, I want to see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5659)|
| 1:34:22| I want to see it right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5662)|
| 1:34:24| But it also has to be a beautiful piece of art,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5664)|
| 1:34:27| but it also has to meet structural integrity so people can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5667)|
| 1:34:31| So does city engineering, do they have to approve those designs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5671)|
| 1:34:36| and beyond the beauty of the art and beyond that piece?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5676)|
| 1:34:42| These artists have installed pieces all over the globe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5682)|
| 1:34:46| They know what they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5686)|
| 1:34:48| However, we do have, I think, the RFQ that will go out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5688)|
| 1:34:54| Mary's the landscape architect and a civil engineer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5694)|
| 1:34:57| And, I mean, they're going to be taking very close a structural engineer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5697)|
| 1:35:01| Thank you, Rick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5701)|
| 1:35:04| There's an allocation in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5704)|
| 1:35:06| There's a portion in this contract for engineering work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5706)|
| 1:35:09| And then, obviously, the base and the foundation will be part of the contract you'll see later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5709)|
| 1:35:17| And that will be, again, on the specifications provided by,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5717)|
| 1:35:21| the detailed specifications provided by the artist and their engineer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5721)|
| 1:35:26| So these two projects will come together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5726)|
| 1:35:29| and there will be engineers on both sides to make sure that's done safely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5729)|
| 1:35:33| And then, obviously, the maintenance of these pieces is something that the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5733)|
| 1:35:37| you know, we maintain lots of different amenities and facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5737)|
| 1:35:40| So we will take that on just like we do in many other places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5740)|
| 1:35:43| Our interactive fountains have maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5743)|
| 1:35:45| The market square stage has maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5745)|
| 1:35:47| We do have public art throughout the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5747)|
| 1:35:50| And in the convention center, that requires maintenance and insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5750)|
| 1:35:53| And so, you know, we're prepared to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5753)|
| 1:35:56| And we'll be involved as the process moves forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5756)|
| 1:35:59| So all those drawings and all that stuff gets submitted just like it would on any other project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5759)|
| 1:36:03| the structural and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5763)|
| 1:36:05| And that gets done first, is what you're saying, and then you put?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5765)|
| 1:36:08| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5768)|
| 1:36:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5769)|
| 1:36:10| Yeah, there's the art piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5770)|
| 1:36:11| There's what obviously sold the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5771)|
| 1:36:14| Now it has to be brought into actual design specifications that will be handed off to the other designer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5774)|
| 1:36:21| to make sure that the base and the artwork come together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5781)|
| 1:36:25| And there will be engineers, licensed engineers, that will handle that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5785)|
| 1:36:29| And Mr. Hagerman is nodding his head that he will be involved as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5789)|
| 1:36:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5793)|
| 1:36:34| And we'll make sure that it's safe before it goes into the foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5794)|
| 1:36:39| And you think that will be completed by?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5799)|
| 1:36:41| I'm going to kick that back to Lisa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5801)|
| 1:36:44| Well, we've been waiting for a contract for four months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5804)|
| 1:36:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5807)|
| 1:36:48| So the clock starts when the mayor signs the contract, when the artist signs the contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5808)|
| 1:36:55| and they are committed to have it done in 64 months, if not sooner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5815)|
| 1:37:00| 64 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5820)|
| 1:37:02| Weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5822)|
| 1:37:03| Weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5823)|
| 1:37:04| Weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5824)|
| 1:37:05| Weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5825)|
| 1:37:06| I'm like, five years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5826)|

| 1:37:22| 64 weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5842)|
| 1:37:23| So everybody wants to break ground in 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5843)|
| 1:37:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5846)|
| 1:37:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5847)|

| 1:37:31| We want to cut the ribbon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5851)|
| 1:37:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5853)|
| 1:37:34| In 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5854)|
| 1:37:35| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5855)|
| 1:37:36| 19 years to cut the ribbon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5856)|
| 1:37:38| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5858)|
| 1:37:39| We want to break ground in 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5859)|
| 1:37:42| Right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5862)|
| 1:37:43| Oh, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5863)|
| 1:37:44| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5864)|
| 1:37:45| Cut the ribbon in 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5865)|
| 1:37:46| That's condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5866)|
| 1:37:47| I'm having time trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5867)|
| 1:37:49| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5869)|
| 1:37:50| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5870)|
| 1:37:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5871)|
| 1:37:52| Councilman Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5872)|
| 1:37:53| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5873)|
| 1:37:54| Can you talk a little bit about the committee and what they were tasked with here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5874)|
| 1:37:58| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5878)|
| 1:37:59| And the process of how we got to this selection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5879)|
| 1:38:03| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5883)|
| 1:38:04| The Public Art Committee was established by ordinance to, in part, commission artwork| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5884)|
| 1:38:08| that is accessible to the public and created through a public process that considers the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5888)|
| 1:38:14| social and physical context of the site and addresses the goals of the public art program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5894)|
| 1:38:20| That's from the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5900)|
| 1:38:21| The people who serve on this committee are Tanisha Baker with Project Grad, Aaron Donovan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5901)|
| 1:38:27| a non-profit executive, Suzanne S. Reckies, artist, Mike Fowler, landscape designer, Duane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5907)|
| 1:38:32| Grieve, who none of you know, with the East Tennessee Community Design Center, Mark Hines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5912)|
| 1:38:38| who is here, architect and developer, Jeff Lockett, a ceramic artist with Pelsopi State,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5918)|
| 1:38:45| Chuck Morris, a graphic artist, Terry Mosley, principal in Anterra Paper and Packaging,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5925)|
| 1:38:50| Sarah Hedstrom-Pinell, landscape designer, John Powers, a sculptor, the University of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5930)|
| 1:38:55| Tennessee, Tommy Rush, glass artist, James Taylor, who is here, who is an artist and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5935)|
| 1:39:00| musician, and Bart Watkins, who is with Lisbeth and Company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5940)|
| 1:39:04| This is an extremely diverse and very well-equipped committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5944)|
| 1:39:11| And so what were they tasked with for this project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5951)|
| 1:39:14| And tell us what the committee did to arrive at this recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5954)|
| 1:39:19| Well, this project was born out of community need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5959)|
| 1:39:22| That little piece of, it might be small, but it is absolutely key.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5962)|
| 1:39:26| It is one of the entry points of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5966)|
| 1:39:30| And right now, it is ignored at best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5970)|
| 1:39:33| The way that the trees have been planted, it's kind of dark, you don't really know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5973)|
| 1:39:38| And really, it's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5978)|
| 1:39:40| Nobody uses it but those people who want to relieve their dogs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5980)|
| 1:39:44| And yet, 14,000 cars plus a day go by there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5984)|
| 1:39:48| Thousands of people walk just by there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5988)|
| 1:39:51| And think of how we use our public spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5991)|
| 1:39:57| We can keep it tidy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5997)|
| 1:39:59| We can pull the weeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=5999)|
| 1:40:01| But if we don't plant fantastic flowers and create fantastic things, what do we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6001)|
| 1:40:08| It's just blank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6008)|
| 1:40:10| And that's the role of public art.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6010)|
| 1:40:12| It's to create a sense of place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6012)|
| 1:40:15| So often in the U.S., since the interstate system, every city seems to look the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6015)|
| 1:40:21| I mean, you get off the interstate, there's McDonald's, there's, you know, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6021)|
| 1:40:24| People are looking for a place that's different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6024)|
| 1:40:27| A place that has something that their city doesn't have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6027)|
| 1:40:31| And they're interested in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6031)|
| 1:40:33| And people, when there's a piece of public art, visitors are not only attracted to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6033)|
| 1:40:38| But it's a point of civic pride to the people who live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6038)|
| 1:40:41| That's ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6041)|
| 1:40:43| What's the third thing about public art?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6043)|
| 1:40:45| Public art creates a sense of place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6045)|
| 1:40:47| It is reflective of the people who live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6047)|
| 1:40:50| It is reflective of their culture and their humor and everything about them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6050)|
| 1:40:55| But it also belongs to every citizen there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6055)|
| 1:41:00| It belongs to all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6060)|
| 1:41:02| And this committee was charged with taking a look at that piece of land and figuring out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6062)|
| 1:41:08| what can we do to transform this, at best, forgotten place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6068)|
| 1:41:14| And turn it into something exciting that is inviting, that is iconic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6074)|
| 1:41:19| that people will think about Knoxville when they see it, just like they, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6079)|
| 1:41:24| when they see the sun sphere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6084)|
| 1:41:26| And so that's what they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6086)|
| 1:41:28| And they engaged with the help of the Community Design Center, a community gathering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6088)|
| 1:41:33| There was a charrette.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6093)|
| 1:41:34| There were six designs that the committees all came up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6094)|
| 1:41:37| Those designs are on the website today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6097)|
| 1:41:40| And those community-generated ideas and designs were used by every artist that responded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6100)|
| 1:41:46| And the second part of it is that we actually put out an RFQ with the help of our brilliant purchasing department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6106)|
| 1:41:54| who helped figure out how we were going to do all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6114)|
| 1:41:57| We had 129 qualified artists from all over the globe who responded to this request for qualifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6117)|
| 1:42:06| Every member of the Public Art Committee sat with me as we went through image after image after image,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6126)|
| 1:42:12| 10 images by 129 artists, you know, 10 images each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6132)|
| 1:42:18| And then they narrowed it down to about 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6138)|
| 1:42:20| And then the group got together in one room and narrowed the 10 down to five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6140)|
| 1:42:25| that they would invite to Knoxville to make presentations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6145)|
| 1:42:29| They came on March the 23rd, the five finalists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6149)|
| 1:42:32| They had breakfast with Madeline Rojero who is the, from whom all blessings flow when it comes to public art.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6152)|
| 1:42:41| There was no, the city of Knoxville did not fund public art until Madeline Rojero came to office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6161)|
| 1:42:49| Zip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6169)|
| 1:42:51| We are behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6171)|
| 1:42:54| We are behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6174)|
| 1:42:55| And thanks to her, we're catching up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6175)|
| 1:42:58| And thanks to council for approving that in the budget, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6178)|
| 1:43:02| You know, these people made a site visit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6182)|
| 1:43:04| They took pictures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6184)|
| 1:43:05| They talked to people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6185)|
| 1:43:06| They went to Big Ears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6186)|
| 1:43:07| They visited all over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6187)|
| 1:43:09| And then they came back with wonderful imaginings of what this little less than an acre could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6189)|
| 1:43:16| And we fell in love with the dream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6196)|
| 1:43:18| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6198)|
| 1:43:19| Well, it sounds like a very exhaustive process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6199)|
| 1:43:22| And I want to thank you and the members of the committee for the hard work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6202)|
| 1:43:26| and just going through that in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6206)|
| 1:43:29| So, you know, I look forward to supporting it and hope it achieves its goals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6209)|
| 1:43:35| and inspires the public and connects sort of the two sides of Summit Hill downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6215)|
| 1:43:40| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6220)|
| 1:43:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6221)|
| 1:43:42| I mean, it will do many things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6222)|
| 1:43:43| I think that some of the things that I love most about this design is the ripples and rolls of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6223)|
| 1:43:50| how that visitors will gravitate to the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6230)|
| 1:43:55| They can chat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6235)|
| 1:43:56| They can make music.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6236)|
| 1:43:58| Travelers will disembark from CAT right there at the corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6238)|
| 1:44:01| Lunchtime picnics will become a daily event there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6241)|
| 1:44:05| I can't wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6245)|
| 1:44:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6247)|
| 1:44:08| Councilwoman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6248)|
| 1:44:10| Thank you so much for your passion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6250)|
| 1:44:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6252)|
| 1:44:13| And I agree, you could sell snow in the summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6253)|
| 1:44:18| What I'd first like to say is that I think that this is a beautiful design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6258)|
| 1:44:23| I think that this is going to be a wonderful addition to our downtown area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6263)|
| 1:44:27| What I will say is I think that our arts alliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6267)|
| 1:44:30| and the committee has been very intentional as it relates to art in downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6270)|
| 1:44:36| I think that as a city, we are probably almost second to one of the largest cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6276)|
| 1:44:44| as it relates to arts and culture in our downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6284)|
| 1:44:47| It's very inviting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6287)|
| 1:44:48| It's eclectic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6288)|
| 1:44:49| It has something for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6289)|
| 1:44:51| And so what I would like to challenge the art community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6291)|
| 1:44:54| and the committee to look at going into 2020 is to expand these opportunities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6294)|
| 1:45:01| these blank canvases, and love and exposure of arts into the inner city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6301)|
| 1:45:08| We have some city parks, I think, that are in dire need of some arts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6308)|
| 1:45:13| and cultural work that could really be, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6313)|
| 1:45:17| just an enormous opportunity for our young people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6317)|
| 1:45:20| as well as the residents there in those communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6320)|
| 1:45:23| And I am going to, a shameless plug for consideration for the committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6323)|
| 1:45:28| would be Danny Mayfield Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6328)|
| 1:45:30| Danny Mayfield being a former council member here representing the 6th District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6330)|
| 1:45:36| and who was maybe still the youngest council person that was ever elected onto this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6336)|
| 1:45:43| And so if you're familiar with that park, it has a gazebo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6343)|
| 1:45:48| It actually has a couple of benches that are memorial benches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6348)|
| 1:45:51| But it is basically a wide open field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6351)|
| 1:45:54| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6354)|
| 1:45:55| It's beautiful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6355)|
| 1:45:56| There is a piece of public art in it, but it's tiny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6356)|
| 1:45:59| Danny's face, which was done by one of our wonderful artists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6359)|
| 1:46:03| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6363)|
| 1:46:05| Thanks for the encouragement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6365)|
| 1:46:06| We are working with a graduate class at the University of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6366)|
| 1:46:12| to identify spaces in East Knoxville for public art.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6372)|
| 1:46:16| They identified Caswell Park, and we asked them to go ahead and find more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6376)|
| 1:46:21| So I'm looking at Hardy Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6381)|
| 1:46:24| I love the Danny Mayfield Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6384)|
| 1:46:28| We're fired up and ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6388)|
| 1:46:31| I can tell, and I appreciate that and look forward to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6391)|
| 1:46:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6395)|
| 1:46:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6396)|
| 1:46:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6397)|
| 1:46:38| Councilwoman Singh-Perez?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6398)|
| 1:46:40| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6400)|
| 1:46:42| There's so much of what you say I agree with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6402)|
| 1:46:45| I think the aspect of having a signature piece is very important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6405)|
| 1:46:49| that space, it is a gateway into downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6409)|
| 1:46:55| Where my issues lie with this is that I think art is for the soul,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6415)|
| 1:47:02| and it's amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6422)|
| 1:47:04| It really does help with quality of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6424)|
| 1:47:07| It's also three blocks away from where just about a month ago we cleared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6427)|
| 1:47:13| underneath the bridge where people were homeless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6433)|
| 1:47:16| and I believe that the city did the right thing because that wasn't a safe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6436)|
| 1:47:20| idyllic situation if there was a lot of violence there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6440)|
| 1:47:23| But the juxtaposition of it happening so close by to me feels like an insult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6443)|
| 1:47:30| It feels like we have other priorities we need to spend our resources on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6450)|
| 1:47:37| And, you know, the whole project costing almost a million dollars right there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6457)|
| 1:47:44| I just can't get on board with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6464)|
| 1:47:47| I hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6467)|
| 1:47:48| You know, when it came out in the paper what the city was doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6468)|
| 1:47:53| going to do underneath Broadway, because I live, not live, I feel like I live,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6473)|
| 1:47:57| I work a block from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6477)|
| 1:47:59| I called Mike Dunthorne, and I said, Mike, please, use public art.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6479)|
| 1:48:04| We want that space under there to be fun and interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6484)|
| 1:48:08| Why shouldn't our homeless people have a beautiful place to be during the day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6488)|
| 1:48:13| and help us, use us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6493)|
| 1:48:15| And he said that he would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6495)|
| 1:48:17| If you go by, and I know that you do, that park right there at the corner of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6497)|
| 1:48:23| Gay Street and Summit Hill that we're talking about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6503)|
| 1:48:26| the beauty of it is there are no doors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6506)|
| 1:48:29| You know, you have to go through a door most places to experience art.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6509)|
| 1:48:34| Not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6514)|
| 1:48:36| And the people who will enjoy it, it's free, it's open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6516)|
| 1:48:40| Why shouldn't our homeless people have a beautiful place to be with a beautiful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6520)|
| 1:48:45| canopy overhead that they can lean back and look up at the sky through?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6525)|
| 1:48:50| They deserve that too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6530)|
| 1:48:53| The other aspect of what I can imagine seeing is art is very subjective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6533)|
| 1:48:57| And I can hear people who are not fond of this design talking about all of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6537)|
| 1:49:03| things that could have been done with this money instead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6543)|
| 1:49:06| And art being subjective makes it very complicated for the city to spend a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6546)|
| 1:49:10| great deal of money on a project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6550)|
| 1:49:12| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6552)|
| 1:49:14| I think that it's just like so many things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6554)|
| 1:49:19| Something on paper that's two-dimensional, we can't see, we can't really feel it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6559)|
| 1:49:24| we're not quite sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6564)|
| 1:49:26| But when you step into it, I think it will change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6566)|
| 1:49:30| When you see your children playing on the steps, when you see that all of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6570)|
| 1:49:34| sudden there's a gathering space there where people would never step foot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6574)|
| 1:49:38| before, they may never love that particular design, but I promise you they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6578)|
| 1:49:44| will love the space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6584)|
| 1:49:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6587)|
| 1:49:48| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6588)|
| 1:49:51| So I have, well, let me ask the question and then I'll probably say a couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6591)|
| 1:49:55| things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6595)|
| 1:49:59| I've lost my train of thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6599)|
| 1:50:02| What I wanted to ask you, Ms. Zinni, was I think when people think of public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6602)|
| 1:50:06| art, can you give us a couple examples of, I wholeheartedly agree with you that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6606)|
| 1:50:11| we go many places that look exactly the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6611)|
| 1:50:15| One shopping center after another, one chain, things are not unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6615)|
| 1:50:19| You could go on vacation here, there, the other, and if you eat at the chain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6619)|
| 1:50:23| places and run into the chain shops to be able to go someplace, you might as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6623)|
| 1:50:28| well just stay at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6628)|
| 1:50:29| It's the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6629)|
| 1:50:30| And so what people are seeking are things that are different and things that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6630)|
| 1:50:33| make things unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6633)|
| 1:50:34| When I think about that, you think of things like the Sun Sphere, the Eiffel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6634)|
| 1:50:38| Tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6638)|
| 1:50:39| Those are, you know, things that you can climb on, touch, go inside, that kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6639)|
| 1:50:43| of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6643)|
| 1:50:44| Can you give us an example for people who are skeptical of artworks like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6644)|
| 1:50:51| and briefly I guess because we've talked about this at length, in other cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6651)|
| 1:50:55| that would compare, where people go and they get their photograph taken with it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6655)|
| 1:50:59| and it is a draw and they pull people in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6659)|
| 1:51:01| We know people come to this area to go and see the mountains and other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6661)|
| 1:51:05| So what will make this a draw or what comparison?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6665)|
| 1:51:09| And I understand what makes it a draw, what other cities have something of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6669)|
| 1:51:13| similar concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6673)|
| 1:51:14| Have you been to Asheville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6674)|
| 1:51:15| Have you been to Asheville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6675)|
| 1:51:16| You know downtown Asheville has that tiny little piece of land and it's got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6676)|
| 1:51:20| that gecko sculpture that's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6680)|
| 1:51:26| It's not my favorite piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6686)|
| 1:51:28| But there is a plaza right behind there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6688)|
| 1:51:33| And when I was visiting in Asheville, people gathered there and they had a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6693)|
| 1:51:38| drum circle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6698)|
| 1:51:39| And after the drum circle, other people came around and they were playing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6699)|
| 1:51:43| instruments and they were singing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6703)|
| 1:51:45| And it was a mix that I will never forget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6705)|
| 1:51:47| There were homeless people there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6707)|
| 1:51:49| Why not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6709)|
| 1:51:51| It's their city too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6711)|
| 1:51:53| There were people who were shopping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6713)|
| 1:51:54| There were people who were playing instruments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6714)|
| 1:51:57| I swear to God there was a topless woman there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6717)|
| 1:52:01| And I was like, you know, forget the gecko, but this could be us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6721)|
| 1:52:08| We could have a wonderful gathering place like that smack down in the middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6728)|
| 1:52:12| of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6732)|
| 1:52:13| I could be the woman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6733)|
| 1:52:16| But, you know, I think that's we have those spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6736)|
| 1:52:21| In San Francisco it's Union Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6741)|
| 1:52:23| You know, you have them all over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6743)|
| 1:52:28| And they're wonderful gathering spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6748)|
| 1:52:31| There's the main terrain park in Chattanooga, very interactive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6751)|
| 1:52:36| These are the feathers in the cap of these cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6756)|
| 1:52:40| These are the things when they're bragging about themselves that they brag about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6760)|
| 1:52:47| Well, I just want to make the point that I understand that there are people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6767)|
| 1:52:50| that are skeptical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6770)|
| 1:52:51| I've actually gotten pro-emails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6771)|
| 1:52:53| I've gotten non-negative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6773)|
| 1:52:55| I've seen negatives on social media.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6775)|
| 1:52:57| But what I liked, it does feel to some people like we're just giving money for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6777)|
| 1:53:02| something, but we're creating an investment in the city that brings back tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6782)|
| 1:53:06| dollars when they eat in the restaurants and buy the gas to go home and the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6786)|
| 1:53:11| things and spend money at Mass Store, which those downtown dollars spent go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6791)|
| 1:53:16| towards, and the Hotel Motel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6796)|
| 1:53:18| All that stuff go towards the low-income housing fund that has happened under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6798)|
| 1:53:23| Mayor O'Hara.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6803)|
| 1:53:24| And if we don't have draws that make people want to come here, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6804)|
| 1:53:28| to see if there's a wig shop in the Sun Sphere, then we don't get those tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6808)|
| 1:53:32| dollars that we need for those funds and to pay for the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6812)|
| 1:53:37| A large chunk of that goes to the BEP as well as paying off the convention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6817)|
| 1:53:41| center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6821)|
| 1:53:42| So that's the positive, and that's how I see it as something that will be a draw| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6822)|
| 1:53:47| for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6827)|
| 1:53:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6828)|
| 1:53:49| I mean, not everybody liked the Sun Sphere either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6829)|
| 1:53:51| You know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6831)|
| 1:53:52| I mean, we are more than concrete here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6832)|
| 1:53:55| We are more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6835)|
| 1:53:58| Vice Mayor Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6838)|
| 1:53:59| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6839)|
| 1:54:00| I would like to offer the Bean in the Millennial Park in Chicago, which this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6840)|
| 1:54:05| reminds me of, and it is swarmed with people, most of whom are not from Chicago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6845)|
| 1:54:11| shopping, and the Art Institute is right next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6851)|
| 1:54:15| So they're having a huge experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6855)|
| 1:54:17| It's wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6857)|
| 1:54:18| And this is very reminiscent of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6858)|
| 1:54:22| Except it's a fraction of the price of the Bean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6862)|
| 1:54:28| We got ours on sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6868)|
| 1:54:31| You sure did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6871)|
| 1:54:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6873)|
| 1:54:34| I want to add a few things here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6874)|
| 1:54:35| Thank you, Lisa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6875)|
| 1:54:37| First of all, I want to say it is guaranteed that there will be people who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6877)|
| 1:54:41| love, love, love this piece of artwork, and there will be people who hate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6881)|
| 1:54:46| That's what artwork is like, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6886)|
| 1:54:48| I mean, people have different opinions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6888)|
| 1:54:50| But I participated or I observed our public arts committee, as Lisa mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6890)|
| 1:54:56| when the final five were brought in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6896)|
| 1:54:58| And that was a good committee, good questions, unbelievable presentations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6898)|
| 1:55:03| And I have to say, and I don't have the artistic genes in our family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6903)|
| 1:55:06| It goes on, and my sister has all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6906)|
| 1:55:09| But I was very impressed by this artist and by the selection that the committee made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6909)|
| 1:55:16| It was awe-inspiring, actually, to see what the work that he does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6916)|
| 1:55:22| So I'm very excited about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6922)|
| 1:55:24| I totally agree and understand Councilwoman Sincereza's comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6924)|
| 1:55:30| You know, we have so many issues in this community, and it is our obligation to address them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6930)|
| 1:55:36| And we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6936)|
| 1:55:37| We just had a long discussion earlier about affordable housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6937)|
| 1:55:40| and we've got several projects going on now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6940)|
| 1:55:45| And, Becky Wade, you'll have a budget amendment sometime in the next few months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6945)|
| 1:55:51| to add more to the affordable housing fund because we have more demand for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6951)|
| 1:55:56| So we are spending millions on affordable housing, on homelessness, on blight remediation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6956)|
| 1:56:02| on addressing low- and moderate-income communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6962)|
| 1:56:07| all the KCDC housing that we have supported over at Walter P. and Five Points area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6967)|
| 1:56:14| So we spend a lot of money on that, and it is crucially important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6974)|
| 1:56:17| But we also know that we work on business development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6977)|
| 1:56:21| We work on neighborhood stabilization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6981)|
| 1:56:23| We work on quality of life, on parks and recreation, on sustainability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6983)|
| 1:56:28| The truth is that we're a pretty dynamic, vibrant city, and we address all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6988)|
| 1:56:33| And I believe that having this iconic artistic piece on that corner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6993)|
| 1:56:39| will add to the heart and soul of our community, the public art| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=6999)|
| 1:56:44| and the arts and culture that we promote through festival after festival,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7004)|
| 1:56:48| all kinds of all types of festivals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7008)|
| 1:56:52| It will add to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7012)|
| 1:56:53| It will feed our soul of our city and the people in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7013)|
| 1:56:58| It will also become an iconic structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7018)|
| 1:57:00| You know, like the Sunsphere, like you said, you love it, you hate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7020)|
| 1:57:03| You know, people have different opinions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7023)|
| 1:57:05| But it's an iconic structure, and it's something that in every picture of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7025)|
| 1:57:08| we have our Sunsphere in there, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7028)|
| 1:57:10| I think this will also be that type of iconic structure, very welcoming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7030)|
| 1:57:14| It also is in such a critical place because we're always trying to link the old city, you know, to downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7034)|
| 1:57:23| And it's a really critical link in that corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7043)|
| 1:57:28| So we can't stop addressing, you know, the blight, the homelessness, affordability, all those things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7048)|
| 1:57:35| and we are committed to doing what we do now and more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7055)|
| 1:57:38| But we also, I think it's critical to invest in our public art and in our arts and culture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7058)|
| 1:57:44| and that's what this particular vote tonight is about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7064)|
| 1:57:47| So I really want to thank Lisa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7067)|
| 1:57:50| I just wish she had more passion for her job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7070)|
| 1:57:54| And James Taylor and Mark Hines and all the Public Arts Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7074)|
| 1:57:58| thanks for being here to show your support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7078)|
| 1:58:00| Rick Emmett, who represents us on the committee, it's a good committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7080)|
| 1:58:04| and they're really making fantastic things happen in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7084)|
| 1:58:08| So I'm supportive of this, and I think if there's no more lights on, we'll go ahead and see if council is too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7088)|
| 1:58:15| So we have a motion and a second for, what is this, 11H?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7095)|
| 1:58:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7102)|
| 1:58:23| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7103)|
| 1:58:24| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7104)|
| 1:58:25| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7105)|
| 1:58:26| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7106)|
| 1:58:27| One no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7107)|
| 1:58:28| So it passes, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7108)|
| 1:58:31| Thank you all for that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7111)|
| 1:58:35| Okay, council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7115)|
| 1:58:38| See, those are all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7118)|
| 1:58:39| We're on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7119)|
| 1:58:40| We've been sitting here two hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7120)|
| 1:58:42| Let's take a very quick break, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7122)|
| 1:58:44| And then we'll be back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7124)|
| 1:58:45| I read your mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7125)|
| 1:58:50| I'll take Will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7130)|
| 1:59:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7160)|
| 1:59:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7190)|
| 2:00:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7220)|
| 2:00:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7250)|
| 2:01:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7280)|
| 2:01:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7310)|
| 2:02:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7340)|
| 2:02:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7370)|
| 2:03:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7400)|
| 2:03:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7430)|
| 2:04:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7460)|
| 2:04:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7490)|
| 2:05:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7520)|
| 2:05:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7550)|
| 2:06:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7580)|
| 2:06:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7611)|
| 2:06:59| Okay, council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7619)|
| 2:07:00| We have now our ordinances on first reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7620)|
| 2:07:04| and I'm going to ask Peter Ahrens to come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7624)|
| 2:07:07| All of these, I guess, have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7627)|
| 2:07:11| Yeah, all of them that will 12A through L are all under his purview,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7631)|
| 2:07:17| so I'm going to have him give you the background on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7637)|
| 2:07:21| Mayor, council members, there's two different things going on right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7641)|
| 2:07:26| 12B is language that clarifies our fire district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7646)|
| 2:07:30| Fire district is an area where there are additional requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7650)|
| 2:07:34| where there's dense development, like you see in downtown and Cumberland Ave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7654)|
| 2:07:39| The balance of the other requests are updating our codes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7659)|
| 2:07:45| our construction codes from the 2012 International Construction Code Edition to the 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7665)|
| 2:07:50| That keeps us in compliance with state regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7670)|
| 2:07:54| They're intended to ensure public health, safety, and welfare,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7674)|
| 2:07:59| and they address emerging construction techniques and technologies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7679)|
| 2:08:04| And we've been talking to our colleagues in the region| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7684)|
| 2:08:09| and our stakeholders since end of July is when we started putting presentations out to the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7689)|
| 2:08:16| and so we feel like we've done a really good job, robust opportunities to get the word out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7696)|
| 2:08:23| So I'll be happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7703)|
| 2:08:25| So we've had an extensive public process to make those who will be impacted aware of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7705)|
| 2:08:29| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7709)|
| 2:08:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7710)|
| 2:08:31| Okay, so why don't we – does anybody have any initial questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7711)|
| 2:08:34| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7714)|
| 2:08:35| So, Peter, when you say that, I mean, have you heard concerns from builders, contractors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7715)|
| 2:08:43| that this is going to raise their costs by a certain percentage, or are they concerned about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7723)|
| 2:08:51| or has there been issues talked about like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7731)|
| 2:08:53| I haven't heard those responses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7733)|
| 2:08:55| That's a reality of construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7735)|
| 2:08:59| Any builder, developer, contractor knows that as the codes are upgraded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7739)|
| 2:09:04| there are additional requirements, and they kind of understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7744)|
| 2:09:09| We haven't had really any negative responses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7749)|
| 2:09:12| It was more just educational in the meetings that we've had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7752)|
| 2:09:18| And when will it take effect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7758)|
| 2:09:20| We'd like to implement the codes January 1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7760)|
| 2:09:24| so if you have an application in prior to that date, you'll be grandfathered in under the 2012 edition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7764)|
| 2:09:31| But then after that, if your drawings are not submitted, you would be reviewed under the 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7771)|
| 2:09:38| So drawings submitted but not approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7778)|
| 2:09:41| Yeah, we really need to recognize, you know, there's some large projects out there that take months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7781)|
| 2:09:46| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7786)|
| 2:09:47| So we recognize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7787)|
| 2:09:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7789)|
| 2:09:50| We've been telling the design professionals, we're getting a lot of calls from design professionals now with just that question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7790)|
| 2:09:56| what do we do with these projects that are started?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7796)|
| 2:09:59| And if we have to redesign under the 2018, it's going to slow the project down, add costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7799)|
| 2:10:05| So we're trying to recognize those issues as they come up and provide opportunities for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7805)|
| 2:10:12| So was it in 2012 we approved the 2012?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7812)|
| 2:10:17| I wasn't here, but I'm going to guess no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7817)|
| 2:10:19| There's usually a lag time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7819)|
| 2:10:21| So I would imagine 2013 would be the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7821)|
| 2:10:25| But for those that were here, it would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7825)|
| 2:10:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7828)|
| 2:10:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7829)|
| 2:10:30| Okay, we're going to let Will start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7830)|
| 2:10:34| Oh, Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7834)|
| 2:10:35| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7835)|
| 2:10:36| If nobody objects and there may be an objection, could we pass all these on emergency?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7836)|
| 2:10:44| That way 12A through L, we won't have to read them all again in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7844)|
| 2:10:54| Is there any objection to that in our law direction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7854)|
| 2:10:57| If Council wishes to do that, certainly they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7857)|
| 2:11:01| Does that not change the implementation date because it takes effect immediately?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7861)|
| 2:11:07| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7867)|
| 2:11:08| It just takes effect immediately, but the code doesn't take effect until the 1st of January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7868)|
| 2:11:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7872)|
| 2:11:16| So we need to read each of these separately into the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7876)|
| 2:11:20| Or can we do them all at once and have one vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7880)|
| 2:11:22| How do you do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7882)|
| 2:11:23| No, we won't be able to read them all together and have one vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7883)|
| 2:11:28| They'll have to be read separately, and you'll have to amend to emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7888)|
| 2:11:32| Okay, so we'll read each one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7892)|
| 2:11:33| We'll take a motion to approve it, then a motion to amend it on emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7893)|
| 2:11:37| We vote on that, and then we go back to the original.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7897)|
| 2:11:40| There is a rule where you can shorten the way in which you read them by using a shortened version| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7900)|
| 2:11:46| in which you would just then announce which code it is that you're introducing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7906)|
| 2:11:54| I'm not sure Will is very fond of that fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7914)|
| 2:11:59| I'm the bad guy here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7919)|
| 2:12:02| Can that just be 12A?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7922)|
| 2:12:06| Are we ready?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7926)|
| 2:12:07| Well, I would suggest since we are passing this on emergency and for the record, we just go ahead and read it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7927)|
| 2:12:12| and that way it's all out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7932)|
| 2:12:14| It's fully transparent what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7934)|
| 2:12:16| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7936)|

| 2:12:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7939)|
| 2:12:20| 12A is an ordinance amending Chapter 11 of the Oxford City Code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181120?start=7940)|
