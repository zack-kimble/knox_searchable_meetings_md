| 0:01:51| Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=111)|
| 0:01:52| Yes, Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=112)|
| 0:01:54| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=114)|
| 0:01:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=116)|
| 0:01:57| Well, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=117)|
| 0:01:58| I would like to put it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=118)|
| 0:02:03| When he says Nick, everyone in the room turns around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=123)|
| 0:02:09| Well, I want to like to postpone 12A for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=129)|
| 0:02:17| That's the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=137)|
| 0:02:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=138)|

| 0:02:21| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=141)|
| 0:02:23| And I might add, Mr. Mayor, that the parties are talking with the police department about possible options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=143)|
| 0:02:30| or changes, and they have a meeting scheduled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=150)|
| 0:02:32| So everyone's in agreement in terms of the police department and one of the applicants that this be postponed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=152)|
| 0:02:39| so that it can be discussed, and then they'll come back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=159)|

| 0:03:16| So are we.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=196)|
| 0:03:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=197)|
| 0:03:19| Under the mayor's report tonight, I have a few things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=199)|
| 0:03:23| First of all, I'd like to recognize Ed Ellis, who was named the field office director for the HUD office here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=203)|
| 0:03:33| I want to welcome him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=213)|
| 0:03:34| And he was named in August 2011 to the position of field office director for HUD here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=214)|
| 0:03:44| As director, Ellis is responsible for the HUD programs in the Knoxville jurisdiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=224)|
| 0:03:51| Also, he will represent Region 4 as the point of contact for all elected officials in the Knoxville area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=231)|
| 0:03:59| On October 2006, Ellis was named as a disaster relief coordinator for HUD headquarters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=239)|
| 0:04:07| and he was responsible for Region 6 and Region 8 as the disaster relief coordinator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=247)|
| 0:04:15| and he served as the point person for the regional administrators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=255)|
| 0:04:19| Prior to becoming the disaster relief coordinator, Ellis served as the field office director for the Greensboro,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=259)|
| 0:04:26| North Carolina HUD office, which serves the state of North Carolina.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=266)|
| 0:04:31| Responsibilities included office activities as it related to elected officials, city managers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=271)|
| 0:04:40| HUD stakeholders, and HUD customers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=280)|
| 0:04:42| Ed, welcome to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=282)|
| 0:04:44| We look forward to working with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=284)|
| 0:04:45| And he's present tonight and would like to welcome you to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=285)|
| 0:04:50| Thank you, Mr. Mayor, and thank you, council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=290)|
| 0:04:53| Again, it's a real delight to be here, to be in the city, to be part of this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=293)|
| 0:04:59| And first of all, I'd like to brag on your staff and Becky and her staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=299)|
| 0:05:11| I hear nothing but good things about this city, working with the staff, and all the good things that you guys are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=311)|
| 0:05:19| And it sure makes my job a whole lot easier when we have a city like this to work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=319)|
| 0:05:24| So thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=324)|
| 0:05:26| I think all of us are very much aware of the changing environment that we live in today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=326)|
| 0:05:33| When we talk about the federal budget, Becky just kind of said in my ear that she was a little concerned about some of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=333)|
| 0:05:43| the markups that's happening in the house committees in regards to the HUD budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=343)|
| 0:05:48| And it's concerning to, I think, all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=348)|
| 0:05:52| But with that said, I think there's opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=352)|
| 0:05:55| For the last two days, I was with our regional administrator, Ed Jennings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=355)|
| 0:06:00| and basically he used the analysis that we're very familiar with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=360)|
| 0:06:05| We can look at this as either the glass half full or the glass half empty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=365)|
| 0:06:11| And I look very forward, again, working with you all, your community, your city, your partners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=371)|
| 0:06:19| to see how we can look at this as a glass half full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=379)|
| 0:06:25| One example, part of my past was working for a city government, much like Becky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=385)|
| 0:06:33| And I know one of the challenges that this city faces, like most cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=393)|
| 0:06:36| is what do we do with the number of vacant lots, vacant properties that just tend to be out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=396)|
| 0:06:45| that are not being productive for families, for businesses, or for our tax revenues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=405)|
| 0:06:54| I hope that I can work with you guys some, work with Becky some,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=414)|
| 0:06:58| to maybe see if there are some solutions or things that we could do to maybe make that productive for this city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=418)|
| 0:07:06| and other communities that we may work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=426)|
| 0:07:10| I think it's key to look at all these opportunities that we face| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=430)|
| 0:07:15| and see what we can do as partners to make things happen and be proactive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=435)|
| 0:07:21| and, again, serve our communities the way that we all want to serve them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=441)|
| 0:07:26| And, again, thank you all very much and I look very forward to being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=446)|
| 0:07:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=449)|
| 0:07:30| Thank you, Mr. Ellis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=450)|
| 0:07:33| Let me also mention about recycling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=453)|
| 0:07:35| Our single stream recycling begins on October the 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=455)|
| 0:07:40| That date is fast approaching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=460)|
| 0:07:42| We have over 18,000 households signed up already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=462)|
| 0:07:47| And also early voting, which will end on Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=467)|
| 0:07:53| Citizens have three more days to vote early for the city of Knoxville primary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=473)|
| 0:07:58| and state senate special primary election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=478)|
| 0:08:01| Election day is a week from today, and I know we all want to encourage folks to make sure that they vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=481)|
| 0:08:08| Also, let me mention tomorrow morning from 8 to 9 a.m. will be the World Alzheimer's Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=488)|
| 0:08:18| That event is going to be held at the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame at 700 Hall of Fame Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=498)|
| 0:08:26| It says, please wear something orange like Weeback Pat T-shirt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=506)|
| 0:08:32| So let's be aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=512)|
| 0:08:34| Also, let me mention that Ms. Cindy Mitchell has won a Distinguished Service Award| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=514)|
| 0:08:41| from the Tennessee Association of Municipal Clerks and Recorders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=521)|
| 0:08:46| And I think it would be appropriate to give her a hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=526)|
| 0:09:01| Speech.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=541)|
| 0:09:02| Speech.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=542)|
| 0:09:03| Speech is just for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=543)|
| 0:09:05| Yes, she does a fine, outstanding job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=545)|
| 0:09:08| Are there any reports of counsel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=548)|
| 0:09:12| Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=552)|
| 0:09:14| Thank you, Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=554)|
| 0:09:15| I'm proud to say that I'm going to be hosting my quarterly Coffee with the Councilman this Saturday from 9 to 11| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=555)|
| 0:09:22| at the internationally famous Roundup Restaurant on Sevierville Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=562)|
| 0:09:26| If you've got any issues that you want to talk to me about or if you just want to come for a good fellowship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=566)|
| 0:09:32| and coffee and a great breakfast, just come on over this Saturday from 9 to 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=572)|
| 0:09:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=578)|
| 0:09:42| I see no further lights from counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=582)|
| 0:09:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=586)|

| 0:13:08| I think we have somebody signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=788)|

| 0:13:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=794)|
| 0:13:15| Mr. McAdams has signed up to speak on that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=795)|
| 0:13:20| If you'd come down, Mr. McAdams, and give your address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=800)|
| 0:13:28| Thank you, Mayor Brown and Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=808)|
| 0:13:30| My name is Tom McAdams, 4823 Old Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=810)|
| 0:13:34| I'm here tonight on behalf of the Knoxville Chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=814)|
| 0:13:39| And we would ask you to consider postponing or tabling consideration of the South City Sector Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=819)|
| 0:13:48| until council and county commission complete the process of deciding what should be included in these plans in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=828)|
| 0:13:55| regard to hillside and ridgetop protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=835)|
| 0:13:59| This plan has been under consideration for some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=839)|
| 0:14:04| The hillside and ridgetop issues have been under consideration for an even longer time, for over three years at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=844)|
| 0:14:12| And the county commission has specifically rejected a number of the elements that are included in the South Sector Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=852)|
| 0:14:23| the proposed plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=863)|
| 0:14:25| And you have all devoted substantial time and effort to working through this process with your joint committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=865)|
| 0:14:32| We think it would be appropriate to take that additional time to ensure that this plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=872)|
| 0:14:38| the South City Sector Plan, is consistent with what you adopt for the entire city and for the entire county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=878)|
| 0:14:46| As it's currently proposed, we think it limits opportunities in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=886)|
| 0:14:52| And by just the happenstance that the South Knoxville Plan came up next for review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=892)|
| 0:15:00| that it would include limitations on them that are not applicable to other areas of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=900)|
| 0:15:05| and may not ever be applicable depending on what actions you take on the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=905)|
| 0:15:10| We apologize for not being here when the matter was on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=910)|
| 0:15:14| As you know, we participated or attended all of your workshops and your joint workshops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=914)|
| 0:15:20| and have been active in not opposing hillside and ridgetop protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=920)|
| 0:15:26| but in supporting a revised method of dealing with those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=926)|
| 0:15:32| We think it's appropriate in this plan to revise the way that that is done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=932)|
| 0:15:37| not to have limitations start at a 15 percent slope, which around here is a pretty average backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=937)|
| 0:15:45| And we think there's better ways of addressing those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=945)|
| 0:15:48| and assuring proper erosion controls and protection of scenic ridges, which I would point out this plan does not do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=948)|
| 0:15:58| The ridgetop protection components were effectively eliminated during the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=958)|
| 0:16:03| and we would propose to put those back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=963)|
| 0:16:05| So we would urge you, in fairness to the people of South Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=965)|
| 0:16:09| in fairness of having a complete plan that is consistent with other areas of the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=969)|
| 0:16:15| and in fairness to it in an effort to have the appropriate plan that does provide the protection that's needed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=975)|
| 0:16:23| we would ask you to table or postpone this until the overall issue has been resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=983)|
| 0:16:31| I'd be happy to answer any questions about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=991)|
| 0:16:35| Houseman Bateley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=995)|
| 0:16:37| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=997)|
| 0:16:38| I was remiss in the council reports not to mention that this coming Thursday at 4.30 here in the small| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=998)|
| 0:16:45| and the large assembly room we're going to have yet another workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1005)|
| 0:16:49| This one will be primarily a public forum where the public can come and talk to both the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1009)|
| 0:16:55| and the county about the results of our facilitator for meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1015)|
| 0:17:00| And that's going to start at 4.30, which is a little change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1020)|
| 0:17:04| Normally we start at 5 o'clock, but that does kind of should enter into this equation here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1024)|
| 0:17:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1031)|
| 0:17:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1032)|
| 0:17:13| Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1033)|
| 0:17:15| Mr. McAdams, I mean, obviously, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1035)|
| 0:17:18| I'm very disappointed and concerned, you know, of your lack of ability to address this on the first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1038)|
| 0:17:25| I mean, that's, you know, we have two readings, and I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1045)|
| 0:17:29| But there's not been, you said, it's not fair to the people of the first district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1049)|
| 0:17:33| which, of course, encompasses, you know, Fort Sanders and all the city portion of South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1053)|
| 0:17:41| But make no mistake here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1061)|
| 0:17:45| The people of South Knoxville vastly support the Hillside Ridgetop Plan as it was originally presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1065)|
| 0:17:52| That has not changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1072)|
| 0:17:53| The, you know, the South Knox Business and Neighborhood Coalition is still in firm support of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1073)|
| 0:18:00| along with many of the, you know, the neighborhood folks that I've heard from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1080)|
| 0:18:04| and in addition to my constituents in Fort Sanders and all over this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1084)|
| 0:18:11| So it's not a disservice to the people of South Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1091)|
| 0:18:13| but the vast majority are in full support of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1093)|
| 0:18:17| And, you know, you've really put us in a box tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1097)|
| 0:18:22| And I don't like being put in a box because of y'all's, you know, I thought Mr. Edwards was here at the last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1102)|
| 0:18:28| I couldn't debate that with you, but I thought he was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1108)|
| 0:18:31| But y'all should have been here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1111)|
| 0:18:35| But you do make a good point about there has been a lot of dialogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1115)|
| 0:18:39| There's been a tremendous amount of meetings between the --historically between the City Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1119)|
| 0:18:45| and the County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1125)|
| 0:18:47| There's been a lot of diligence and out of respect to the hard work that Vice Mayor Bailey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1127)|
| 0:18:53| and Chairman Mike Hammond have done on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1133)|
| 0:19:00| Then, you know, and we've got another workshop coming up, as the Vice Mayor alluded to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1140)|
| 0:19:05| I am going to be willing to postpone this one time until the October 18th meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1145)|
| 0:19:13| And that's going to put everybody on notice that, you know, if there's something going to happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1153)|
| 0:19:17| hopefully it's going to happen quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1157)|
| 0:19:19| But I don't like being in this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1159)|
| 0:19:23| But the only reason that I'm going to do this tonight is just because of the work that has been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1163)|
| 0:19:29| It's unfinished work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1169)|
| 0:19:30| There's a possibility that there could be some compromise found in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1170)|
| 0:19:34| Maybe there will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1174)|
| 0:19:35| Maybe there won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1175)|
| 0:19:36| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1176)|
| 0:19:37| But I think it's worth, you know, we see the light at the end of the tunnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1177)|
| 0:19:40| If this was going to be a six-month process and my instincts told me that, then I'd pass it tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1180)|
| 0:19:45| I'll be honest with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1185)|
| 0:19:46| I would go ahead and make the motion to pass it and whatever my colleagues want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1186)|
| 0:19:50| But that's where I'm at on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1190)|
| 0:19:55| I'm really disappointed in the Chamber's inability to present themselves, you know, in a proper time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1195)|
| 0:20:07| Councilwoman Marotti.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1207)|
| 0:20:09| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1209)|
| 0:20:10| Mr. McAdams, I echo Councilman Pavlis' frustration with this 11th hour appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1210)|
| 0:20:17| This document has been in the public domain since July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1217)|
| 0:20:20| There were three public meetings held in July with a final one being held on July the 26th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1220)|
| 0:20:25| Public notice was published in the Knoxville News Sentinel on August the 5th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1225)|
| 0:20:29| This would be heard at the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1229)|
| 0:20:31| The Planning Commission heard this on August the 11th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1231)|
| 0:20:34| We heard this two weeks ago on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1234)|
| 0:20:36| And at 926 this morning, members of Council received an e-mail from the Knoxville Chamber saying that there's opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1236)|
| 0:20:42| I will support Councilman Pavlis' motion to postpone because the tradition of this Council is to be open to public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1242)|
| 0:20:49| And if anyone, corporate, citizen, individual, comes and has a concern, we will always give adequate time for further research| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1249)|
| 0:20:57| and further input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1257)|
| 0:20:58| But there is tremendous frustration on my part and perhaps on the part of my colleagues that the Knoxville Chamber was not able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1258)|
| 0:21:06| to manage this more effectively when this document has been in the public domain since July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1266)|
| 0:21:12| Councilman DellaVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1272)|
| 0:21:13| Yes, thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1273)|
| 0:21:15| I have a simple suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1275)|
| 0:21:18| As I thumb through this again, this sector plan, there's not per se an adoption of the hillside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1278)|
| 0:21:26| ridgetop plan as it was drafted, but there are some references to hilltop or hillside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1286)|
| 0:21:33| and ridgeline protection areas, and they describe some of those slope characteristics he was talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1293)|
| 0:21:39| Is there any problem with, and maybe this is addressed to Mr. Swanson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1299)|
| 0:21:43| with adopting this subject to changes in the general plan as they may be adopted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1303)|
| 0:21:50| In other words, that if there is an adjustment, as he suggests there might be in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1310)|
| 0:21:56| that they would just be incorporated in here, that there would be no intent to make them inconsistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1316)|
| 0:22:01| Can we do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1321)|
| 0:22:02| That would be convenient, but I don't believe you can do it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1322)|
| 0:22:05| I think you have to adopt whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1325)|
| 0:22:07| As is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1327)|
| 0:22:08| Whatever is before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1328)|
| 0:22:10| And you can't say that it's going to be amended automatically at some point in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1330)|
| 0:22:15| to be consistent with something that may or may not happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1335)|
| 0:22:18| So postponement allows you to see how that other process works out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1338)|
| 0:22:21| It would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1341)|
| 0:22:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1342)|
| 0:22:23| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1343)|
| 0:22:24| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1344)|
| 0:22:26| Mr. McAdams, I appreciate your coming tonight with the concerns of the chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1346)|
| 0:22:30| I echo my colleague's sentiments that, once again, the chamber has waited to the 11th hour to show up with a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1350)|
| 0:22:37| To postpone this, in many ways, is an affront to the process that this chamber| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1357)|
| 0:22:43| and others have adopted in regard to public input, public policy, public hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1363)|
| 0:22:50| And I just feel like that is an example of the chamber trying to bully this group into doing something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1370)|
| 0:22:57| that we all are not comfortable doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1377)|
| 0:23:00| I would hope that this is not the beginning of a pattern with the chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1380)|
| 0:23:04| We saw this on the hilltops, ridges, and slopes originally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1384)|
| 0:23:08| We're now seeing it on second reading on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1388)|
| 0:23:10| And I would just like to go on record as saying I do not hope to see this as a pattern of the chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1390)|
| 0:23:16| I would hope the chamber would be engaged from the very beginning when we have matters of public concern and issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1396)|
| 0:23:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1403)|
| 0:23:24| Vice Mayor Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1404)|
| 0:23:26| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1406)|
| 0:23:27| I'm going to support the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1407)|
| 0:23:29| However, I think, you know, next Thursday we'll have the joint workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1409)|
| 0:23:34| There was an effort made last two weeks ago or a week ago that the council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1414)|
| 0:23:41| and the commission have some sort of a straw poll to see if we can find a consistent plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1421)|
| 0:23:47| if there is any room for compromise or, you know, do we want to vote the plan as it is, up or down or what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1427)|
| 0:23:55| So after the public forum, what we intend to do is to have a straw poll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1435)|
| 0:24:00| And then after the straw poll is taken, whichever way that goes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1440)|
| 0:24:04| then what we'll do as a council is we'll go back and we'll follow what the charter requires us to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1444)|
| 0:24:10| And I've been working with Mr. Swanson and others on methods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1450)|
| 0:24:14| and procedures by which we could do that and do that as quickly as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1454)|
| 0:24:19| But I do think that after Thursday at the earliest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1459)|
| 0:24:23| then the next council meeting we would bring up the plan, bring it to the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1463)|
| 0:24:28| and then we would begin our own discussion and dialogue based on what happened at the straw poll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1468)|
| 0:24:33| So I do think it's important to try to postpone this until we have one overall plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1473)|
| 0:24:40| And if we can agree with the county on a plan, we'll do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1480)|
| 0:24:43| If not, we'll just then begin our process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1483)|
| 0:24:45| So I'm going to, if we don't have a motion, is there a motion on the table?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1485)|
| 0:24:49| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1489)|
| 0:24:50| I'm going to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1490)|
| 0:24:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1491)|
| 0:24:51| I don't believe we have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1491)|
| 0:24:53| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1493)|
| 0:24:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1494)|
| 0:24:55| Been moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1495)|
| 0:24:57| When is the postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1497)|
| 0:24:59| October 18th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1499)|
| 0:25:01| Four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1501)|
| 0:25:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1502)|
| 0:25:03| The motion is to you want to restate your motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1503)|
| 0:25:06| Yes, sir, to postpone until the October 18th meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1506)|
| 0:25:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1509)|
| 0:25:10| It's been moved and properly seconded to postpone to October 18th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1510)|
| 0:25:17| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1517)|
| 0:25:18| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1518)|
| 0:25:19| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1519)|
| 0:25:20| Opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1520)|
| 0:25:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1522)|
| 0:25:23| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1523)|
| 0:25:24| So ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1524)|
| 0:25:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1526)|
| 0:25:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1527)|
| 0:25:28| 9G is an ordinance to rezone property located on the west side of South Central Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1528)|
| 0:25:33| north of East Summit Hill Drive from C3 to C2, the Cortland Group Applicant, 6th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1533)|
| 0:25:40| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1540)|
| 0:25:41| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1541)|
| 0:25:42| Been moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1542)|
| 0:25:44| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1544)|
| 0:25:45| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1545)|
| 0:25:46| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1546)|
| 0:25:47| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1547)|
| 0:25:48| So ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1548)|
| 0:25:48| This is an ordinance to repeal by grassroots ministry of a decision by the Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1548)|
| 0:25:52| to deny rezoning of property located on the west side of North Broadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1552)|
| 0:25:57| south of North Central Street from C3, General Commercial District, to C2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1557)|
| 0:26:02| Central Business District, in conjunction with Ordinance 12B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1562)|
| 0:26:06| which is an ordinance to rezone the property located on the west side of North Broadway from C3 to C2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1566)|
| 0:26:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1574)|
| 0:26:14| We have a person signed up to speak on that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1574)|
| 0:26:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1584)|
| 0:26:29| Are you Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1589)|
| 0:26:30| I'm Mr. Bartholomew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1590)|
| 0:26:31| Bartholomew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1591)|
| 0:26:32| I was not aware we needed to sign up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1592)|
| 0:26:34| I'm one of the applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1594)|
| 0:26:36| I'm representing the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1596)|
| 0:26:38| We'll go ahead if there's no objection from anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1598)|
| 0:26:45| Do you want me to make a motion to suspend the rules?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1605)|
| 0:26:48| I don't really think you need to do that because council's rules provide an appeal situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1608)|
| 0:26:54| for three speakers up to five minutes, starting with those who favor the appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1614)|
| 0:27:00| followed by three speakers up to five minutes each for those who oppose the appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1620)|
| 0:27:05| and then a two-minute rebuttal by those who favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1625)|
| 0:27:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1629)|
| 0:27:10| So I guess according to that rule, I cannot defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1630)|
| 0:27:12| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1632)|
| 0:27:13| You can speak for five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1633)|
| 0:27:15| You can let someone else who's in favor of the appeal speak for five minutes first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1635)|
| 0:27:20| You can be one of three and you can choose where you go among those three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1640)|
| 0:27:25| But you can't wait until after somebody else has spoken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1645)|
| 0:27:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1648)|
| 0:27:29| You will have two minutes for rebuttal or somebody on the side favoring the appeal will have two minutes for rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1649)|
| 0:27:35| After the folks who are opposed to the appeal have an opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1655)|
| 0:27:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1659)|
| 0:27:40| Well, let me go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1660)|
| 0:27:41| Can you give your name and address, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1661)|
| 0:27:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1663)|
| 0:27:44| Parker Bartholomew, 8400-50 Old Colony Trail, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37923.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1664)|
| 0:27:50| I'm here, obviously, a member of grassroots representing the we're trying to rezone to C2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1670)|
| 0:27:59| The reason that we are wanting to rezone to C2 is because in C2 zoning there is no parking required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1679)|
| 0:28:05| There's no parking requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1685)|
| 0:28:08| And that's why we have to go from C3 to C2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1688)|
| 0:28:11| A couple of things that were mentioned at MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1691)|
| 0:28:14| We are not going to have residential housing of people in this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1694)|
| 0:28:22| And we are prepared to allow city council to make that a requirement under their approval of C3 to C2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1702)|
| 0:28:35| That means no beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1715)|
| 0:28:37| It means nobody's spending the night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1717)|
| 0:28:39| That means no residential component to this building at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1719)|
| 0:28:44| And I know that was a major concern of the community when we first applied for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1724)|
| 0:28:53| We are not a social service provider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1733)|
| 0:28:56| A lot of people have been wanting to call us a social service provider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1736)|
| 0:28:59| We are a church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1739)|
| 0:29:00| We will spread the gospel of Jesus Christ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1740)|
| 0:29:04| And we will do so in love and compassion and serving as many people as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1744)|
| 0:29:10| Rich, poor, homeless, not homeless, blind, yellow, black, white.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1750)|
| 0:29:15| We want to spread the gospel of Jesus Christ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1755)|
| 0:29:18| We are a church and a ministry, not a social service provider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1758)|
| 0:29:24| In the sector plan, it clearly states that it has been approved by the city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1764)|
| 0:29:29| and the Metropolitan Planning Committee both in 2007 that the appropriate zoning for this area is C2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1769)|
| 0:29:37| It mentions it on page 10 under zoning, and I'm going to quote this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1777)|
| 0:29:44| A major part of the study area is zone C3, mainly the Broadway and central corridors and Emory Place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1784)|
| 0:29:50| This type of zoning is an obstacle making the streets more pedestrian friendly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1790)|
| 0:29:55| and does not encourage a mix of uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1795)|
| 0:29:59| Several lots have C2 zoning, the zoning used for downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1799)|
| 0:30:04| Again, on page 28, under summary of proposed land use plan changes, number one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1804)|
| 0:30:11| extend the downtown to a wider area around Emory Place by zoning to C2 or similar mixed use district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1811)|
| 0:30:18| Number three, central corridor should be rezoned from C3 to a mixed use district that includes offices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1818)|
| 0:30:25| residential or retail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1825)|
| 0:30:27| And number four, replace C3 zoning between Colon Place and Silver Place with mixed use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1827)|
| 0:30:33| medium density, residential or office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1833)|
| 0:30:35| And again, that one we are not going residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1835)|
| 0:30:39| So of the six summary bullet points, three of them either specifically mention that you need to go from C3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1839)|
| 0:30:47| because it's not favorable in that area or you need to go to C2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1847)|
| 0:30:51| And this is something that was approved by city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1851)|
| 0:30:55| Under the public meeting input on page 31, the public stated that zoning that allows mixed use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1855)|
| 0:31:03| and residential uses in order to create a more pedestrian friendly environment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1863)|
| 0:31:07| the current suburban standards for parking might not be appropriate in such areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1867)|
| 0:31:13| Under the second public meeting, extension of the downtown land use recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1873)|
| 0:31:20| and design principles, historic districts, concept of the buffer zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1880)|
| 0:31:26| Page 37, development characteristics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1886)|
| 0:31:29| If mixed use buildings are desirable, such buildings should be rewarded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1889)|
| 0:31:33| with more flexible development standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1893)|
| 0:31:35| For example, fewer off street parking spaces would be required for commercial development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1895)|
| 0:31:44| Page 38, under parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1904)|
| 0:31:46| No off street parking is required for non-residential uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1906)|
| 0:31:53| Page 22, under central corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1913)|
| 0:31:55| Central street is zoned mostly general commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1915)|
| 0:31:58| In order to revitalize this area and make it more attractive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1918)|
| 0:32:01| it should be rezoned to a mixed use district to create a higher density uses such as office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1921)|
| 0:32:07| medium density, residential or retail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1927)|
| 0:32:10| As you can clearly see, city council has already gone over this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1930)|
| 0:32:14| and approved that C3 is not the appropriate zoning in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1934)|
| 0:32:18| It was supported by MPC staff for all those same reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1938)|
| 0:32:23| There was never once any concern for any use other than a church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1943)|
| 0:32:29| that would possibly serve the homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1949)|
| 0:32:31| This is where the problem came in, and I think that it's very important to note| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1951)|
| 0:32:37| that there is a lot of liability that begins to be placed upon the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1957)|
| 0:32:41| and that myself as a taxpayer and someone that would rather not have that as an issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1961)|
| 0:32:47| you know, there's a lot of liability that comes in when the only reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1967)|
| 0:32:52| that this is not being rezoned is because it's a church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1972)|
| 0:32:55| and because there's a fear that we will serve a homeless population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1975)|
| 0:33:00| We're going to serve everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1980)|
| 0:33:02| That's our intention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1982)|
| 0:33:03| We're going to spread the gospel of Jesus Christ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1983)|
| 0:33:05| We are not going to have residential areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1985)|
| 0:33:08| And just to go ahead and go down this route, the first thing is the First Amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1988)|
| 0:33:15| of the Constitution of the United States of America states| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1995)|
| 0:33:18| that no religious exercise should be inhibited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=1998)|
| 0:33:23| Not only did the United States Congress reiterate this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2003)|
| 0:33:26| but they also passed the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2006)|
| 0:33:33| That act was upheld July 12, 2011, by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2013)|
| 0:33:41| and in that the city of Yuma, Arizona, prohibited a church from going into an area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2021)|
| 0:33:47| because they thought that it would be counterproductive to the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2027)|
| 0:33:52| that was going to go on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2032)|
| 0:33:54| Now, this act has not been challenged in the Supreme Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2034)|
| 0:33:59| There was a previous act to that that was challenged,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2039)|
| 0:34:02| and the Congress then went back and changed it, and it was adapted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2042)|
| 0:34:09| And just about a month and a half ago, the Ninth District Court upheld it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2049)|
| 0:34:13| Now, the problem with liability comes in for a city is that not only does it prohibit any discrimination,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2053)|
| 0:34:20| but it also states that a city or municipality can be held liable for any damages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2060)|
| 0:34:27| I must tell you, you have reached your five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2067)|
| 0:34:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2070)|
| 0:34:31| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2071)|
| 0:34:33| Is there anyone else speaking in favor of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2073)|
| 0:34:38| If not, the next person to speak against is Commissioner Brawls, Amy Brawls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2078)|
| 0:34:49| Oh, there she is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2089)|
| 0:34:50| Ms. Brawls, let me say I'm glad to see you up and about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2090)|
| 0:34:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2094)|
| 0:34:55| And glad that you're doing well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2095)|
| 0:34:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2098)|
| 0:34:59| And if you may, for the record, give your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2099)|
| 0:35:02| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2102)|
| 0:35:03| My name is Amy Brawls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2103)|
| 0:35:04| I live at 316 Eastcott Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2104)|
| 0:35:06| And I only want to make one short comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2106)|
| 0:35:09| and then I want to turn the rest of my time over to Lauren Ryder because I'm still having some issues speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2109)|
| 0:35:17| But I did want to say that as a commissioner who represents this district that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2117)|
| 0:35:24| I feel like this will be detrimental to the neighborhoods and the businesses that have worked so hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2124)|
| 0:35:29| I also represent the homeless who live on the streets in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2129)|
| 0:35:34| And I've had many, many years of experience working with the homeless here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2134)|
| 0:35:38| I've worked with the homeless in Atlanta, in Washington, D.C., in Austin, Texas, and Denver, Colorado.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2138)|
| 0:35:47| The last thing that I think it's disingenuous to focus on the church aspect of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2147)|
| 0:35:53| The reason this church wants to locate there is they want to serve the homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2153)|
| 0:35:58| The homeless do not need another hand up or another hand out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2158)|
| 0:36:02| What they need is a hand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2162)|
| 0:36:04| And one of the most distressing things that I've seen recently since the 10-year plan is on hiatus is that we have moved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2164)|
| 0:36:12| from a beds first, get them off the streets, into permanent housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2172)|
| 0:36:20| We've already lost that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2180)|
| 0:36:22| We're back to the emergency shelter paradigm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2182)|
| 0:36:26| And I find that very distressing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2186)|
| 0:36:28| I think this is a step backwards and a step in the wrong direction, not only for the neighborhoods that I represent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2188)|
| 0:36:35| but also for the homeless that I represent and that I work with every week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2195)|
| 0:36:42| So since I'm still not able to talk well, I'm turning the rest of my time over to Lauren Ryder, who's president of ONK,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2202)|
| 0:36:50| and she's going to finish up for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2210)|
| 0:36:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2212)|
| 0:36:53| Also, let me let Mr. Smiles address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2213)|
| 0:36:56| Our rules don't permit you to defer your time to another person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2216)|
| 0:36:59| You can either use five minutes or you will be one of the three speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2219)|
| 0:37:02| So there will be two other speakers permitted to speak, up to five minutes each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2222)|
| 0:37:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2227)|
| 0:37:08| And, Lauren, can I have the notes, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2228)|
| 0:37:11| Well, we have the --are you going to continue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2231)|
| 0:37:16| Yes, I'll continue for another minute or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2236)|
| 0:37:21| As I said, the request is not just for a church, but it's a church that their main focus is to serve the homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2241)|
| 0:37:34| And another service provider in that area is not what we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2254)|
| 0:37:38| It's moving those providers further and further up Broadway, closer and closer to the neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2258)|
| 0:37:43| that are already feeling the stress of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2263)|
| 0:37:48| I feel like the amount of investment that's been made public and private over nearly $9 million of new investment has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2268)|
| 0:37:57| been made in this specific area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2277)|
| 0:37:59| And this is not going to support that investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2279)|
| 0:38:03| It could be very detrimental to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2283)|
| 0:38:09| It also seems like I also wanted to mention that what's been announced today, the new pizza place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2289)|
| 0:38:16| is going to go in on the corner of Jackson and Broadway, which that's something new that is being added there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2296)|
| 0:38:24| And they're definitely going to be impacted by the homeless and the transients in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2304)|
| 0:38:32| The zoning change is not being requested by the owner of that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2312)|
| 0:38:37| It's being requested by a rental tenant who we don't know how long they will be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2317)|
| 0:38:45| It's also going to put the burden of parking for the church onto the business community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2325)|
| 0:38:50| that we just heard already there's not enough parking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2330)|
| 0:38:54| I think this might cause some unnecessary parking conflicts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2334)|
| 0:38:59| I also think that all of the things that we went through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2339)|
| 0:39:03| we just heard about the sector plan for that area and zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2343)|
| 0:39:09| I heard a lot of mention of retail, residential, commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2349)|
| 0:39:16| I didn't hear churches or homeless service providers mentioned once during that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2356)|
| 0:39:26| So I think, again, it's a bit disingenuous to say that this is a church that's going to serve everybody, their location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2366)|
| 0:39:34| And what they have said during private conversations is that they are there to provide services to the homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2374)|
| 0:39:44| So I very, very strongly oppose this, not just for the neighborhoods in my district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2384)|
| 0:39:51| and the schools in my district, but also for the homeless in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2391)|
| 0:39:54| This is not in their best interests either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2394)|
| 0:39:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2397)|
| 0:39:58| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2398)|
| 0:39:59| The next person signed up is Melinda Wetzel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2399)|
| 0:40:05| Melinda Wetzel is the next person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2405)|
| 0:40:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2409)|
| 0:40:10| Is there any way we can change that up, or is that just the way that it is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2410)|
| 0:40:14| Can you change it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2414)|
| 0:40:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2415)|
| 0:40:16| It's fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2416)|
| 0:40:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2417)|
| 0:40:18| If you'd identify yourself and give your address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2418)|
| 0:40:20| I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2420)|
| 0:40:21| My name is Brandon Clark, and my address is 7603 Alky Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2421)|
| 0:40:25| It's 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2425)|
| 0:40:28| I'm here to represent the business owners, but I'm also here to represent the families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2428)|
| 0:40:34| and the neighbors in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2434)|
| 0:40:37| And to be honest with you, Knoxville is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2437)|
| 0:40:40| All of us are wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2440)|
| 0:40:41| We love to take care of people, and that's one of the things that we're obviously good at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2441)|
| 0:40:47| because we don't have a homeless problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2447)|
| 0:40:52| We have a homeless industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2452)|
| 0:40:54| We are phenomenal at taking care of the homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2454)|
| 0:40:57| Unbelievable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2457)|
| 0:40:59| People come from miles around because we have great services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2459)|
| 0:41:03| I think that's admirable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2463)|
| 0:41:05| That's great for a community like ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2465)|
| 0:41:09| The problem that we're dealing with is that these neighbors and these business owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2469)|
| 0:41:13| and myself and my father and everybody that's involved in our business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2473)|
| 0:41:18| we've gotten to the point where we're just sick and tired and we're fed up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2478)|
| 0:41:24| and we're just not going to take it anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2484)|
| 0:41:28| We're tired of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2488)|
| 0:41:34| I can't tell you what it's like to have your three-year-old daughter come with you to work on a Saturday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2494)|
| 0:41:39| when you don't really want to be at work on Saturday, but you're a hardworking citizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2499)|
| 0:41:43| You're somebody trying to better the community, and you have to walk around and pick condoms up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2503)|
| 0:41:48| I can't tell you what that's like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2508)|
| 0:41:50| And we knew what we were getting into when we moved in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2510)|
| 0:41:54| But the thing that we see is vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2514)|
| 0:41:56| We have vision for this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2516)|
| 0:41:58| We realize that downtown Knoxville has a beautiful and historic neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2518)|
| 0:42:04| that should be the centerpiece in the neighborhood of downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2524)|
| 0:42:08| And I'm fed up, and I'm tired of it, and all these people are, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2528)|
| 0:42:12| This is ridiculous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2532)|
| 0:42:13| I'm standing my ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2533)|
| 0:42:15| You know, this whole thing, this ministry, taking care of the homeless, I'm all for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2535)|
| 0:42:21| I think it's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2541)|
| 0:42:22| We're one of the best in the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2542)|
| 0:42:25| But I just want us to realize that for Knoxville to move forward, we must be taking care of our businesses downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2545)|
| 0:42:32| and we must be taking care of our community downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2552)|
| 0:42:35| That involves this neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2555)|
| 0:42:40| I'd also like to go straight to the report of the mayor from the Fifth and Broadway Task Force, December 12, 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2560)|
| 0:42:52| The purpose of the Fifth and Broadway Initiative is to create, with the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2572)|
| 0:42:57| and Knox County, a viable, enjoyable, and sustainable environment that includes homeless care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2577)|
| 0:43:03| and business and neighborhood growth, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2583)|
| 0:43:06| That's what it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2586)|
| 0:43:08| Report to mayor, Fifth and Broadway Task Force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2588)|
| 0:43:13| Number one, work to avoid any further concentration of homeless services in the Broadway Fifth area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2593)|
| 0:43:19| And number two, try to find a suitable non-homeless service provider oriented use for midway building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2599)|
| 0:43:27| and other vacant buildings in the general area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2607)|
| 0:43:30| The decision to move this zoning issue does not do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2610)|
| 0:43:36| I believe in the vision of this report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2616)|
| 0:43:39| I believe in Mayor Haslam and what he did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2619)|
| 0:43:42| I've watched progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2622)|
| 0:43:44| I've been a part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2624)|
| 0:43:46| We all have been a part of the community, and we're asking you to please give us a break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2626)|
| 0:43:52| Please let us lead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2632)|
| 0:43:53| It is our time to lead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2633)|
| 0:43:55| It is our time to grow our families, to grow our neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2635)|
| 0:43:59| and to ultimately grow the businesses that support you and them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2639)|
| 0:44:04| That's all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2644)|
| 0:44:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2647)|
| 0:44:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2648)|
| 0:44:09| Now we have Melinda Wetzel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2649)|
| 0:44:14| Could you give your address, Ms. Wetzel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2654)|
| 0:44:17| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2657)|
| 0:44:18| I live at 1015 Luttrell Street in the historic Fourth and Gill neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2658)|
| 0:44:22| which is about four blocks from the property in question tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2662)|
| 0:44:26| In addition to being a resident of the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2666)|
| 0:44:29| I also have served as the immediate past president of the Fourth and Gill Board of Directors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2669)|
| 0:44:37| and I also have served many years on the Knoxville Historic Zoning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2677)|
| 0:44:44| I'm here representing myself, the Fourth and Gill Board of Directors, the residents of Fourth and Gill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2684)|
| 0:44:53| and I will speak for the residents of Old North Knoxville, too, who I think would like to stand at this moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2693)|
| 0:45:00| And I'm here representing these people who are asking you to uphold the MPC decision to deny the appeal of 619 Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2700)|
| 0:45:09| We are seeking this denial for four reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2709)|
| 0:45:13| First and foremost, I would like to reiterate what Mr. Clark just said in honoring the initiatives that were said in the Fifth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2713)|
| 0:45:22| and Broadway Task Force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2722)|
| 0:45:24| Specifically, to create, we would ask you to continue to create an environment that includes homeless services and businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2724)|
| 0:45:34| and neighborhood growth, to continue efforts to avoid enabling the homeless and increasing its population,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2734)|
| 0:45:42| and to continue working to avoid any further concentration of those services in Broadway and Fifth Avenue area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2742)|
| 0:45:52| Secondly, we do not believe that this zone change to C2, which includes residential and historic areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2752)|
| 0:46:00| to be consistent and compatible with what the neighborhoods have been working for for 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2760)|
| 0:46:07| These neighborhoods have been reclaimed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2767)|
| 0:46:10| And as I stated to MPC, I don't want to sound self-congratulatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2770)|
| 0:46:15| We have made these neighborhoods our homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2775)|
| 0:46:18| We care about them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2778)|
| 0:46:19| But we also believe in a larger part and believe that it moves beyond our larger selves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2779)|
| 0:46:26| We feel like we've reclaimed these neighborhoods for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2786)|
| 0:46:30| We'd like for you to work in partnership with us to support 30 years of time, sweat, money, and passion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2790)|
| 0:46:40| If there is a continual sprawl of homeless services, it threatens everything we have accomplished| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2800)|
| 0:46:48| and everything we could possibly achieve for the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2808)|
| 0:46:52| On a third point, Mr. Bartholomew was asked to contact the neighborhood or the homeless service providers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2812)|
| 0:46:59| and have conversations to his intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2819)|
| 0:47:02| He has spoken to neither.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2822)|
| 0:47:04| I spoke with Jenny Weatherstone and with Bruce Spangler last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2824)|
| 0:47:10| Jenny is with VMC, and Mr. Spangler is the president of the Homeless Coalition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2830)|
| 0:47:15| Both of them told me, and I quote, no contact now or ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2835)|
| 0:47:21| Mr. Spangler went on to say that he wishes that Mr. Bartholomew would coordinate with the Homeless Coalition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2841)|
| 0:47:29| which he has not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2849)|
| 0:47:31| And in not doing so, it undermines the recent efforts to try to create a network for homeless providers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2851)|
| 0:47:41| As I mentioned, Mr. Bartholomew hasn't spoken to any of the neighborhoods either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2861)|
| 0:47:46| If he had, I think that we would have told him that we are definitely opposed to this rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2866)|
| 0:47:53| But we would also have told him that we are sympathetic to his desire to help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2873)|
| 0:47:58| his desire to provide help to the marginalized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2878)|
| 0:48:02| A church, he says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2882)|
| 0:48:04| He wants to do a church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2884)|
| 0:48:06| We would point out to him that one half a block across the street from 619 Broadway there is a church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2886)|
| 0:48:13| In fact, there are seven churches within four linear blocks of 619 Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2893)|
| 0:48:20| They are St. John's Lutheran, First Christian, Central United Methodist, Broadway Baptist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2900)|
| 0:48:28| St. James Episcopal, First Lutheran, and First Presbyterian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2908)|
| 0:48:33| If Mr. Bartholomew's mission is really to serve the marginalized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2913)|
| 0:48:38| why not partner with one of those established historic churches?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2918)|
| 0:48:43| One of those churches where the facilities already exist, where they are compliant in all codes and zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2923)|
| 0:48:50| and where programs are already in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2930)|
| 0:48:54| Our opposition is not directed toward helping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2934)|
| 0:48:57| Our opposition is against dedicating one more piece of property to a service where there are already so many pieces of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2937)|
| 0:49:08| property and programs put in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2948)|
| 0:49:11| Ms. Wessel, your time is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2951)|
| 0:49:13| I am finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2953)|
| 0:49:14| That's perfect timing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2954)|
| 0:49:15| We ask you to please support us and to deny this appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2955)|
| 0:49:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2959)|
| 0:49:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2960)|
| 0:49:21| Mr. Bartholomew, you have two minutes if you wish to rebut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2961)|
| 0:49:30| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2970)|
| 0:49:31| A couple of items here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2971)|
| 0:49:33| Just like to make note, the Fifth and Broadway Task Force was done in 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2973)|
| 0:49:39| Both of those items that were mentioned were known as short-term goals or items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2979)|
| 0:49:45| And that was almost five years ago now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2985)|
| 0:49:49| I'd like to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2989)|
| 0:49:51| And also, the sector plan was done after this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2991)|
| 0:49:58| And the report to the mayor on the Fifth and Broadway Task Force from December 12, 2006,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=2998)|
| 0:50:02| was not adopted by city council or MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3002)|
| 0:50:06| At MPC, it was mentioned by Mr. Mark Donaldson that, and I'm going to quote this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3006)|
| 0:50:12| I want to remind the commission that a church and a ministry is permitted in all of our zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3012)|
| 0:50:16| We are forbidden by any law from excluding them from any location in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3016)|
| 0:50:21| We've been using the C2 zone district in this part of the city extensively in the last two years to encourage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3021)|
| 0:50:27| and redevelop the building simply because C2 does not require any use where C3 does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3027)|
| 0:50:34| Within the last year, we have approved C2 in two locations, one within 500 feet of this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3034)|
| 0:50:39| and the other easily within 1,000 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3039)|
| 0:50:42| There are actually eight churches in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3042)|
| 0:50:44| There's Old North Knoxville Abbey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3044)|
| 0:50:46| That's located at Emory Place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3046)|
| 0:50:48| That is a very large development in that area, over 30,000 square feet of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3048)|
| 0:50:54| And it is with a company that I work for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3054)|
| 0:50:57| My livelihood is based in real estate, specifically the downtown property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3057)|
| 0:51:02| And the absolute last thing I want to do is hinder the growth of downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3062)|
| 0:51:05| I've spent a lot of time and effort trying to build this city and bring successful to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3065)|
| 0:51:11| Your two minutes are now up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3071)|
| 0:51:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3073)|
| 0:51:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3074)|
| 0:51:17| Those are all of the persons signed up to speak on that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3077)|

| 0:53:15| for marshaling historic facts and background information to advance the cause of historic preservation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3195)|
| 0:53:21| within this community to an unprecedented degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3201)|
| 0:53:25| And whereas while serving as our historic preservation planner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3205)|

| 0:53:38| and through individual and district nominations, she nominated more than 3,000 buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3218)|
| 0:53:45| I want to stress that, 3,000 buildings within the community for inclusion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3225)|
| 0:53:51| within the National Register of Historic Places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3231)|

| 0:54:16| as a professional planner within the Metropolitan Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3256)|
| 0:54:20| but she also has been most generous with her own time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3260)|
| 0:54:24| during which for 15 years she volunteered to serve as an ex officio member of the Board of Directors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3264)|
| 0:54:30| of Knox Heritage and is a very faithful participant in the monthly educational sessions conducted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3270)|

| 0:55:37| and the council further wishes to convey their very best wishes to Ms. Bennett| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3337)|
| 0:55:42| for continued success and happiness following her retirement with MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3342)|
| 0:55:47| Upon adoption, the city recorder is respectfully requested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3347)|
| 0:55:50| and directed to forward a true and correct copy of this resolution to Anne Bennett| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3350)|
| 0:55:56| in order to make her aware of the city council's action with respect to this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3356)|
| 0:56:01| This resolution shall take effect from and after its passage, the public welfare requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3361)|
| 0:56:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3368)|
| 0:56:25| Now, I've worked with Anne long enough that I'm sure she has a few words to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3385)|
| 0:56:28| Right, Anne?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3388)|
| 0:56:32| Other than I'm overwhelmed, the first historic overlay that we did in Knoxville was Mechanicsville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3392)|
| 0:56:40| And tonight you passed the revision to their guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3400)|
| 0:56:46| So it seems that things have come full circle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3406)|
| 0:56:49| But it also seems to me that there are people sitting and standing behind me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3409)|
| 0:56:53| and people who aren't here who really deserve all these accolades a lot more than I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3413)|
| 0:56:59| And so I'm looking forward to working with neighborhoods and with Knox Heritage in my retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3419)|
| 0:57:07| And I want to thank everybody who isn't standing at this podium for all the success that I had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3427)|

| 0:57:44| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3464)|
| 0:57:47| Mr. King, one of the things that I was wondering about in this study that is being proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3467)|
| 0:57:56| are they also going to look at the existing bridge from the standpoint of how it might be utilized as far as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3476)|
| 0:58:04| direction in terms of getting across?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3484)|
| 0:58:05| I know the bridge now has the elevator and the stairs down to the park, but is it being looked at in any way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3485)|
| 0:58:10| It's a pretty fantastic bridge from an aesthetic standpoint also from the fairgrounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3490)|
| 0:58:15| Is that going to be part or is it just from the museum down to the park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3495)|
| 0:58:22| Wrong item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3502)|
| 0:58:23| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3503)|

| 0:59:29| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3569)|
| 0:59:31| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3571)|
| 0:59:32| That's the one I want to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3572)|
| 0:59:37| Is that part of this proposal, to look at that bridge also, the existing bridge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3577)|
| 0:59:44| Or could it be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3584)|
| 0:59:46| Which existing bridge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3586)|
| 0:59:48| The, what bridge is that that goes across the World's Fair Park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3588)|
| 0:59:54| The Clinch Avenue Viaduct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3594)|
| 0:59:57| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3597)|
| 0:59:59| This is a totally separate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3599)|
| 1:00:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3601)|
| 1:00:02| Where is it being proposed to locate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3602)|
| 1:00:05| What we are planning to do is to do a feasibility study for a pedestrian structure that would cross the railroad tracks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3605)|
| 1:00:15| near the art museum in an effort to connect the World's Fair Park to the art museum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3615)|
| 1:00:24| and also to make a better connection into Fort Sanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3624)|
| 1:00:30| Has any thought been given to the Clinch Avenue Bridge using it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3630)|
| 1:00:35| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3635)|
| 1:00:37| Is there a reason not to look into that possibility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3637)|
| 1:00:40| Well, I think our, the mission that we were assigned to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3640)|
| 1:00:44| and I think engineering along with policy has some interest in making this connection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3644)|
| 1:00:53| And I think either Dr. Lyons or maybe Ann Wallace may be here to talk about Fort Sanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3653)|
| 1:01:00| Our assignment was to determine the cost of a structure in this location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3660)|
| 1:01:08| and to look at different types of structures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3668)|
| 1:01:11| and to see how they would fit in both with the surrounding properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3671)|
| 1:01:20| Mr. Mayor, may I add to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3680)|
| 1:01:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3681)|
| 1:01:23| Council Member Grieve, just to clarify a little further,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3683)|
| 1:01:27| what Steve has shared with you is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3687)|
| 1:01:32| This goes back to the fall of 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3692)|
| 1:01:36| We had conversations with representatives principally from KMA who proposed this possibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3696)|
| 1:01:44| and I think it's noted in the material that you were given about previous studies that they had done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3704)|
| 1:01:51| And so council in December approved the funding for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3711)|
| 1:01:58| This was, along with four other items, were budget amendments that council approved to the 2010-2011 fiscal budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3718)|
| 1:02:11| And so this is just the follow-through to that and actually putting together the contract to do the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3731)|
| 1:02:21| Well, I realize that, but what I'm saying is that we have a major entrance going into Fort Sanders right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3741)|
| 1:02:26| through Clinch Avenue, and we have a bridge that goes across already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3746)|
| 1:02:31| And all I'm saying is that really that bridge is one building away from the Museum of Art.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3751)|
| 1:02:37| And that bridge has a sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3757)|
| 1:02:39| It has an elevator that goes down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3759)|
| 1:02:41| It already crosses the railroad tracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3761)|
| 1:02:43| And all I'm saying is, is it possible, and I realize the study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3763)|
| 1:02:47| and I realize what was done back in December with the approval of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3767)|
| 1:02:52| but it seems to me that we're being a bit short-sighted by not taking advantage of a major structure that's already there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3772)|
| 1:03:00| that we might be able to somehow connect the art museum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3780)|
| 1:03:03| It sounds like more that we're connecting the art museum to the World's Fair Park than we are Fort Sanders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3783)|
| 1:03:09| because even the structure that's been put up there at the roadway, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3789)|
| 1:03:14| the pedestal that's been put up that welcomes you into Fort Sanders is right there on that street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3794)|
| 1:03:21| So all I'm saying is that it seems to me that that's one area that we ought to look at instead of thinking about putting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3801)|
| 1:03:28| another bridge over the railroad tracks into the World's Fair Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3808)|
| 1:03:31| I'm just asking if that's part of the, could be part of the study, part of being what's looked into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3811)|
| 1:03:37| Well, it currently is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3817)|
| 1:03:40| We're not opposed to taking that under consideration as we go through this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3820)|
| 1:03:46| But as I mentioned, the purpose of this is to have a consultant give us an idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3826)|
| 1:03:54| or several schemes or schematics of what a structure would look like there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3834)|
| 1:03:58| But we can also, you know, consider if your suggestion would satisfy the needs of the connection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3838)|
| 1:04:07| I'm just asking that there's a possibility of a scheme that looks at the existing bridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3847)|
| 1:04:12| and how that viaduct may be used in terms of getting people from not only the art museum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3852)|
| 1:04:18| but also from Fort Sanders down onto the World's Fair site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3858)|
| 1:04:22| Because I think we spent, I don't know how much money was spent for the elevator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3862)|
| 1:04:24| and the structure that was right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3864)|
| 1:04:27| But it seems to me that that ought to be one of the possibilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3867)|
| 1:04:30| I don't think staff is opposed to considering that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3870)|
| 1:04:35| It's just not currently included, but we can go back and look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3875)|
| 1:04:38| That's all I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3878)|
| 1:04:39| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3879)|
| 1:04:41| Councilman Della Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3881)|
| 1:04:42| Yes, thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3882)|
| 1:04:46| Steve, I know we've already spoken about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3886)|
| 1:04:48| I guess I'm still a little concerned that we're doing a second study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3888)|
| 1:04:54| One was a vision study by Sasaki Associates that the museum had done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3894)|
| 1:05:01| and wanted some connectivity to the World's Fair Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3901)|
| 1:05:05| And I can understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3905)|
| 1:05:06| And apparently they even have some donors who might be willing to help support some of the cost of a bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3906)|
| 1:05:12| But this study is not even going to design a bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3912)|
| 1:05:15| It's just going to be another feasibility look at proper location and type of bridge and what we might do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3915)|
| 1:05:23| And there's no harm in exploring that except that we're going to spend, you know, close to $50,000 on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3923)|
| 1:05:31| And we haven't begun to pay for either design or construction of a bridge that will be done with city money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3931)|
| 1:05:38| that may not be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3938)|
| 1:05:39| So I'm appreciative that the Museum of Art is an important structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3939)|
| 1:05:44| And it's important to tie it in as best we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3944)|
| 1:05:49| And I know their interests are to try to improve any access they can get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3949)|
| 1:05:56| Like Councilman Graves said, there certainly is a major bridge that crosses the World's Fair Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3956)|
| 1:06:03| I'm willing to go along with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3963)|
| 1:06:05| But, frankly, this may be $48,000 we spend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3965)|
| 1:06:09| And then this goes in a little book and sits on a shelf somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3969)|
| 1:06:12| It may never get built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3972)|
| 1:06:14| It certainly wouldn't be a top priority in a world of scarce dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3974)|
| 1:06:18| But I understand you've gotten talented architects to look at this, and that's your proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3978)|
| 1:06:24| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3984)|
| 1:06:25| Councilwoman Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3985)|
| 1:06:27| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3987)|
| 1:06:28| Is there anybody here tonight representing the Knoxville Museum of Art?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3988)|
| 1:06:38| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3998)|
| 1:06:39| My name is Mark Hines, 123 South K Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=3999)|
| 1:06:42| I'm an architect and developer in downtown Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4002)|
| 1:06:45| And I've been working for a few years on this project with the Knoxville Museum of Art| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4005)|
| 1:06:49| and the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4009)|
| 1:06:51| And let me just sort of give some history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4011)|
| 1:06:54| The Knoxville Museum of Art put out an RFP and hired a firm from Boston named Sasaki.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4014)|
| 1:07:01| And they came down to look at the KMA, specifically a garden we have that's unused right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4021)|
| 1:07:07| And within that process, we were very fortunate to have them come down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4027)|
| 1:07:11| because they really just didn't look really at our project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4031)|
| 1:07:14| but they looked at the entire World's Fair site in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4034)|
| 1:07:18| They took a bird's eye view of the entire site and really spent time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4038)|
| 1:07:23| and a lot of energy on things they really weren't paid for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4043)|
| 1:07:26| And what they did that was probably the most important thing was look at the parking lot that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4046)|
| 1:07:34| on the World's Fair Park Drive that the city currently owns right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4054)|
| 1:07:38| And that parking lot is very inefficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4058)|
| 1:07:40| And one of the best ideas they actually had was to basically double the size of that lot on its current footprint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4060)|
| 1:07:48| It's a one-way drive with angled parking right now and is very inefficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4068)|
| 1:07:52| And with some regrading, and that's what part of this study is, is looking at the regrading of that site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4072)|
| 1:07:58| they could almost double that lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4078)|
| 1:08:00| And if you've been downtown on a Saturday in the summer, I've got three children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4080)|
| 1:08:03| it's very hard to find parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4083)|
| 1:08:05| That World's Fair Park has been very successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4085)|
| 1:08:08| There's a lot of events during the weekends and certainly the fountains and the playground that are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4088)|
| 1:08:14| And it's tough to get from that parking lot or any of the parking lots down to the World's Fair Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4094)|
| 1:08:20| You can take the Clinch Avenue Bridge certainly, but most people, most pedestrians actually walk down the hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4100)|
| 1:08:27| cross the train tracks, then have to come all the way back through into the park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4107)|
| 1:08:30| and there's no parking in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4110)|
| 1:08:32| So this study really is to let the city look at one of their current assets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4112)|
| 1:08:41| which is a parking lot on the top of the hill, enlarging that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4121)|
| 1:08:45| connecting it through the museum down to World's Fair Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4125)|
| 1:08:50| There's really a lot of pieces of this, and I could go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4130)|
| 1:08:52| I've given this presentation probably five times, but not to city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4132)|
| 1:08:55| We've invited city council in the past to come to the KMA to talk about this and look at our presentation from Sasaki.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4135)|
| 1:09:02| I've been very fortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4142)|
| 1:09:03| The city has let me be involved in the process of selecting the next architect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4143)|
| 1:09:07| And this next process really is to look at the feasibility and the possibility of enlarging that parking lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4147)|
| 1:09:14| making connection from Fort Sanders across the art museum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4154)|
| 1:09:17| giving better access to the art museum to World's Fair Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4157)|
| 1:09:20| and ultimately giving the park better access to that lot and its pedestrians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4160)|
| 1:09:27| And I can answer any other questions you have while I'm here if you'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4167)|
| 1:09:31| I'm glad, Mark, that you're here to represent the museum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4171)|
| 1:09:34| I know when Mayor Haslam brought this budget amendment to us it was either implied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4174)|
| 1:09:39| or stated that perhaps the construction of this project would be done through a public-private partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4179)|
| 1:09:46| And I guess I, you know, just because council adds this to the budget doesn't necessarily mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4186)|
| 1:09:51| that we need to spend the money, you know, on the other end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4191)|
| 1:09:54| And so the concerns that I'm hearing tonight from my colleagues on my left| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4194)|
| 1:09:57| and my right are in tight budget times, you know, $50,000 in the scope of the whole city budget is maybe a small amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4197)|
| 1:10:04| but we don't want that to be money that's ill-spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4204)|
| 1:10:07| And so we need some sort of assurance that this is a project that's not just pie in the sky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4207)|
| 1:10:14| And, you know, we have no idea what the cost of the design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4214)|
| 1:10:18| or the construction would be once this feasibility study is complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4218)|
| 1:10:23| And so I guess I'm asking for some more details in terms of what comes next with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4223)|
| 1:10:30| Do we have any idea?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4230)|
| 1:10:31| You know, we're still hoping to have enough funds to do a pedestrian connection bridge across the river to the south waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4231)|
| 1:10:38| And we know from those discussions that bridges are very, very expensive things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4238)|
| 1:10:43| And so I guess even though this is just $50,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4243)|
| 1:10:48| I'd like some more assurance of how realistic this vision is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4248)|
| 1:10:52| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4252)|
| 1:10:53| And that's a fantastic question and one we've wrestled with at the KMA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4253)|
| 1:10:57| And, again, I wear a couple hats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4257)|
| 1:10:59| I'm a developer downtown, an architect, and I believe very much in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4259)|
| 1:11:03| and have worked very hard for the last five years to improve this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4263)|
| 1:11:06| And I think that this is one small area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4266)|
| 1:11:11| The World's Fair Park is just it's really blossomed over the last few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4271)|
| 1:11:14| A lot of efforts and a lot of money put into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4274)|
| 1:11:16| And you can just see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4276)|
| 1:11:18| It's a dynamic space and a great public space for all of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4278)|
| 1:11:22| And the KMA, I'll speak on their behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4282)|
| 1:11:27| We always have felt like we've turned our back on the World's Fair Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4287)|
| 1:11:30| That's kind of how we feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4290)|
| 1:11:32| There's a long story about the design of the KMA and how it was developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4292)|
| 1:11:35| It was supposed to be in the candy factory, and it was supposed to connect to the candy factory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4295)|
| 1:11:38| It just never really worked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4298)|
| 1:11:40| And in the end, it became this white box that faced World's Fair Park Drive with a very steep hill behind it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4300)|
| 1:11:47| and train tracks and what's happened, it turned into a beautiful park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4307)|
| 1:11:52| We can always second guess what we've done in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4312)|
| 1:11:54| That was 20 years ago this year that that museum was built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4314)|
| 1:11:58| And we've struggled for years to try to have better connectivity to the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4318)|
| 1:12:04| And World's Fair Park Drive really is not a very good connection to the city of Knoxville, unfortunately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4324)|
| 1:12:10| It's just almost a cut-through street and a leftover afterthought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4330)|
| 1:12:13| So to answer your question, Councilwoman Roddy, we feel like we will certainly have money to put into the bridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4333)|
| 1:12:23| especially the area that crosses over our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4343)|
| 1:12:26| And we think we have several donors who are very interested in paying for this bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4346)|
| 1:12:30| What we don't know is how much it's going to cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4350)|
| 1:12:32| And we've asked the city and engineering specifically to look at a few options, one more affordable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4352)|
| 1:12:37| and one more on the upper end to give us a good sort of idea of the cost of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4357)|
| 1:12:42| And then I'll make it my point in the KMA's commitment to go out and try to raise money for this bridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4362)|
| 1:12:48| I don't think the city has some money for this bridge right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4368)|
| 1:12:50| We all know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4370)|
| 1:12:52| The former mayor Haslam knew that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4372)|
| 1:12:54| What I will say, though, is I think the city should really look hard at that parking lot and the redevelopment of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4374)|
| 1:13:00| And I think I talked to Mr. King in engineering about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4380)|
| 1:13:03| That's why I believe this is before city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4383)|
| 1:13:06| It's really about the city's property and improving that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4386)|
| 1:13:12| Thank you, Mr. Hines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4392)|
| 1:13:13| I also wanted to call on Ms. Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4393)|
| 1:13:15| Did you have anything to add about this project or your involvement with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4395)|
| 1:13:21| This is the area that you work on for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4401)|
| 1:13:23| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4403)|
| 1:13:24| Ann Wallace, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4404)|
| 1:13:26| Sure, I'd just like to add a few points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4406)|
| 1:13:28| One, and just very briefly from a history perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4408)|
| 1:13:32| considering that it is a great neighborhood that has had a lot of attention put to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4412)|
| 1:13:36| this effort was actually brought up in the 2000 Fort Sanders Forum plan that was adopted by city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4416)|
| 1:13:44| and the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4424)|
| 1:13:46| And you probably can't see it on this drawing, but basically there are four places along World's Fair Park Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4426)|
| 1:13:52| at the eastern edge of the Fort Sanders neighborhood that MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4432)|
| 1:13:57| and the Fort Sanders Forum group, including representatives of the hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4437)|
| 1:14:00| and the university said are important connections to get people to that resource.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4440)|
| 1:14:06| So wanting to make sure that, you know, we keep our plans off the shelf| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4446)|
| 1:14:11| and moving forward and bringing them to fruition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4451)|
| 1:14:14| I think it's worth a small investment to determine the feasibility of this proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4454)|
| 1:14:20| so that we can make a wise and prudent decision on whether or not it's worth moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4460)|
| 1:14:25| And also, I think Councilman Grieve makes an excellent point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4465)|
| 1:14:28| what can we do to improve the connectivity along Clinch Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4468)|
| 1:14:32| which maybe doesn't seem as pedestrian friendly or engaging as it potentially could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4472)|
| 1:14:38| So that being said, it was also a topic of discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4478)|
| 1:14:41| in our most recent planning efforts for the Fort Sanders neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4481)|
| 1:14:44| and came up several times, you know, how do we connect to World's Fair Park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4484)|
| 1:14:48| In addition to that, we recently had the STEM school that's opened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4488)|
| 1:14:52| and how do we get those students safely to the University of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4492)|
| 1:14:56| especially when you consider that one option is climbing the hill over the railroad tracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4496)|
| 1:15:01| Not really the way we want to encourage people to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4501)|
| 1:15:03| So if we have other options and other ways for people to get where they need to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4503)|
| 1:15:09| it's just one more point in connectivity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4509)|
| 1:15:11| and ways to improve the usefulness and the accessibility of that space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4511)|
| 1:15:17| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4517)|
| 1:15:18| I think that's all the questions I have for right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4518)|
| 1:15:20| Councilman Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4520)|
| 1:15:21| I just want to say again that I'm not opposed to the study being done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4521)|
| 1:15:25| I'm just saying that, again, because of the economic situation that we're in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4525)|
| 1:15:29| and the fact that we do have a bridge, we do have a structure there that has an elevator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4529)|
| 1:15:33| I'm all for trying to get the parking, you know, down through there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4533)|
| 1:15:36| because it's pretty tough to go down by the old railroad station| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4536)|
| 1:15:42| and cross those tracks to get to the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4542)|
| 1:15:44| But I do think that one of the things that we ought to look at is not turn our back to that bridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4544)|
| 1:15:49| and the possibility of how it could be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4549)|
| 1:15:52| There's possibilities of how that bridge could be tied into the backside of the World's Fair Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4552)|
| 1:15:56| So that's all I'm asking is that that be considered also in the study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4556)|
| 1:16:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4563)|
| 1:16:04| I think we do have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4564)|
| 1:16:07| Are there any other questions on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4567)|
| 1:16:10| There's a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4570)|

| 1:19:18| Councilman Dela Lope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4758)|
| 1:19:19| Yes, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4759)|
| 1:19:20| I wanted to clarify one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4760)|
| 1:19:21| Mr. Polk is not able to be here tonight, but I am familiar with this activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4761)|
| 1:19:27| And the caption says that there's a cost, but there really isn't a direct cost to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4767)|
| 1:19:32| What the purpose of this particular authorization is to replace an existing concessions contractor that's been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4772)|
| 1:19:41| removed from that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4781)|
| 1:19:43| Ovation's Food Services actually does the work for us over at the Civic Auditorium and Coliseum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4783)|
| 1:19:49| and they have graciously agreed to help out by working at that other venue, the Jacobs Building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4789)|
| 1:19:58| for a period of time up to but no more than $25,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4798)|
| 1:20:03| In the meantime, the city is looking at other concession options, including running that themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4803)|
| 1:20:09| But we have scheduled events at that venue, and they will be doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4809)|
| 1:20:14| The reality is rather than being a cost, the dollar amount is a ceiling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4814)|
| 1:20:19| Ovation will share the net proceeds after taxes and expenses with the city on a 50-50 basis as they run the concession| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4819)|
| 1:20:27| plans at these activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4827)|
| 1:20:29| So it's really just giving us leeway to bridge the gap until we can get a permanent solution there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4829)|
| 1:20:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4835)|
| 1:20:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110920?start=4836)|
