| 0:04:48| well, but it was really neat to see just, you know, we were the only school system in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=288)|
| 0:04:53| the country of the 15 organizations that were recognized, so it was great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=293)|

| 0:05:15| tanks to the Ukraine to support, and that's part of his logistics job right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=315)|

| 0:05:53| is Mr. Myers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=353)|
| 0:05:56| If I could real quick, Jason, before you start, if that's okay, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=356)|
| 0:06:00| I just wanted to start by saying this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=360)|
| 0:06:02| I'll let Jason talk in a second, but a couple things I just wanted to say first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=362)|
| 0:06:07| So this is really a critical point for us as a district, and just want to remind folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=367)|
| 0:06:12| you know, when we took this on a couple months ago by asking, this is really what we wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=372)|
| 0:06:17| to do as a staff and really brought that to the board at that time to really say, how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=377)|
| 0:06:21| can we serve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=381)|
| 0:06:22| And we mean success for every student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=382)|

| 0:06:30| process, to the families from the different regions and the regional focus groups, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=390)|
| 0:06:34| also to our task force, who's done a great job professionally looking at that and bringing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=394)|
| 0:06:39| recommendations to us as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=399)|
| 0:06:41| I just wanted to say that we know that this work is hard, but we know that it's the right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=401)|
| 0:06:45| work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=405)|
| 0:06:46| And until all of our students are achieving at the level they need to and have those obstacles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=406)|
| 0:06:49| removed, we'll continue to work on continuous improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=409)|
| 0:06:53| And I just wanted to say about Mr. Myers before he gets started, I've known Jason for about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=413)|
| 0:06:58| 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=418)|
| 0:07:00| I knew him first as a special education teacher and knew his commitment in the classroom and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=420)|
| 0:07:05| his commitment to making things happen for kids even at that level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=425)|
| 0:07:09| He was an early co-teacher that we had in design that we had at the school we were at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=429)|
| 0:07:13| just working on infusing algebra and English with a special ed teacher, teaching beside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=433)|
| 0:07:18| a certified teacher, and just the ideas and the innovation that he brought to the task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=438)|
| 0:07:22| And anticipating what he's going to share tonight can tell you that I personally couldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=442)|
| 0:07:28| think of a better person to lead this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=448)|
| 0:07:30| I know his heart, and I know it was two decades of work that he's put into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=450)|
| 0:07:33| So looking forward to hearing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=453)|
| 0:07:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=455)|
| 0:07:36| Good evening, Madam Chair, members of the board, Dr. Reiswick, and thank you for your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=456)|
| 0:07:40| kind words, as always, Dr. Reiswick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=460)|
| 0:07:43| No pressure at all tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=463)|
| 0:07:45| I'm happy to share the interim report on special education with the group tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=465)|
| 0:07:50| As you'll recall, in February, Dr. Reiswick tasked me with conducting and leading a deep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=470)|
| 0:07:55| dive into our policies and procedures and practices in student success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=475)|
| 0:07:59| Over the last couple of months, we've heard from our RTI team, and most recently, we heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=479)|
| 0:08:04| from our special education task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=484)|
| 0:08:06| Tonight, I'm going to be discussing special education and what I believe will be our path| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=486)|
| 0:08:12| forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=492)|
| 0:08:14| This should look familiar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=494)|
| 0:08:15| This is the framework we've used to guide this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=495)|
| 0:08:17| For tonight's purposes, I want to draw your attention to the overlap between some of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=497)|
| 0:08:21| input mechanisms and our capacity to start taking action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=501)|
| 0:08:25| This will be important as I start talking through some of the work we're already doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=505)|
| 0:08:30| In student success, we believe that this work was too important just to sit and wait until| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=510)|
| 0:08:34| we had gone through the full process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=514)|
| 0:08:36| So as we have gotten input, whether it was from our educator input portal or our family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=516)|
| 0:08:42| focus groups or from the special education task force, we believe it was important to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=522)|
| 0:08:47| immediately start taking steps to improve opportunities for our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=527)|
| 0:08:54| So across those multiple inputs, we found a few themes, and that's what our discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=534)|
| 0:09:00| topics will be today is immediate action steps that I'm proposing to fill the needs that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=540)|
| 0:09:06| we've discovered across these input mechanisms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=546)|
| 0:09:10| First, we want to improve our communication, frequency, quality, and consistency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=550)|
| 0:09:16| You're going to hear me say all staff a lot tonight throughout this, and I want to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=556)|
| 0:09:20| clear that my position on all staff is all staff, starting with me, the assistant superintendent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=560)|
| 0:09:27| through our director of special education, through every level of our organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=567)|
| 0:09:32| So this is not just going to be something we're going to push down to schools without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=572)|
| 0:09:37| not first visiting our own capacity and our own willingness to grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=577)|
| 0:09:41| I believe that we lead from the front, and that's what I intend to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=581)|
| 0:09:45| So anytime I say all, so I don't have to remind everybody what all means, all means| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=585)|
| 0:09:50| for real all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=590)|
| 0:09:52| Meeting the needs of students with disabilities is not just the obligation of the special| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=592)|
| 0:09:56| ed department or student success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=596)|
| 0:09:59| They are our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=599)|
| 0:10:01| They are our students in Knox County, and it will take a willingness to change our mindset| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=601)|
| 0:10:06| across the board to fully meet their needs and give them the best opportunity to move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=606)|
| 0:10:12| forward in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=612)|
| 0:10:13| So we're going to start with improving our communication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=613)|
| 0:10:15| We're going to enhance our protocols and practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=615)|
| 0:10:18| We're going to expand coaching and training for all staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=618)|
| 0:10:22| We should all be modeling continuous learning at every level in our organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=622)|
| 0:10:27| The second we stop learning, we're dead in the water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=627)|
| 0:10:29| So again, all staff means all staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=629)|
| 0:10:32| Developing a student-first school-level decision-making strategy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=632)|
| 0:10:36| We have to get back into a position where the decisions are being made for students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=636)|
| 0:10:40| by those who are working most closely with that student, and that is going to be a major| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=640)|
| 0:10:45| priority as we push this work forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=645)|
| 0:10:48| Building our capacity for continuous improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=648)|
| 0:10:50| I want to be clear tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=650)|
| 0:10:52| Under my leadership, our pursuit of continuous improvement will never be finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=652)|
| 0:10:57| There will never be a time where I sit in a meeting and be like, yeah, we've arrived.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=657)|
| 0:11:01| We're as good as we can ever be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=661)|
| 0:11:03| That time will never come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=663)|
| 0:11:05| I felt that way when I started my career as a TA, and it's just as true today as an assistant superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=665)|
| 0:11:11| We will continually be seeking to get better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=671)|
| 0:11:14| And then finally, we want to improve our processes for collaborating with families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=674)|
| 0:11:20| Before I dive into this slide, I want to talk about why I'm committed to this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=680)|
| 0:11:25| I've addressed the Board of Education over the years over countless topics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=685)|
| 0:11:30| Some of them, like I had to talk about bedbugs one time, and I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=690)|
| 0:11:34| I don't know a lot about bedbugs, just to be candid, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=694)|
| 0:11:37| All the way to, you know, what's the difference between three feet and six feet for social distancing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=697)|
| 0:11:42| And what's this mean if this person gets isolated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=702)|
| 0:11:44| And what are we going to do about this mask mandate and all these things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=704)|
| 0:11:48| This is the first time I've ever had the opportunity to talk to the Board of Education about special ed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=708)|
| 0:11:53| And so for me, my commitment to this work is grounded in the fact that this is where I started my career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=713)|
| 0:11:59| A lot of people rolled the dice on Jason Myers over the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=719)|
| 0:12:03| and the first person that did it rolled it on a 21-year-old version of myself and made me a teaching assistant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=723)|
| 0:12:09| And I thought it was the greatest job that I was ever going to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=729)|
| 0:12:12| And the reason that I thought it was the greatest job I was ever going to have is I had this small group of kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=732)|
| 0:12:17| and my only job every day was to create opportunities for those kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=737)|
| 0:12:21| And I knew immediately that I loved it, and that's what I wanted to do with my career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=741)|
| 0:12:26| So then I, in a very nontraditional way, became a special education teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=746)|
| 0:12:30| And as Dr. Ryser referenced, I taught in all sorts of settings, both special ed and gen ed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=750)|
| 0:12:36| And I was part of the first co-teaching cohort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=756)|
| 0:12:39| And I did help publish a presentation for the Council for Exceptional Children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=759)|
| 0:12:44| on how you can implement co-teaching as a successful model in an urban school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=764)|
| 0:12:48| And that was when I started to shift my mind not just to impacting the students directly under my supervision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=768)|
| 0:12:54| but how can I be a reformer? How can I create more opportunities for more students?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=774)|
| 0:12:59| And at that point, I was given the opportunity to enter into school administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=779)|
| 0:13:03| and my first task didn't have, I mean, candidly, again, had no idea really what I was going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=783)|
| 0:13:09| But my first task was to redesign a comprehensive high school into a small learning community school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=789)|
| 0:13:14| back before it was hip to do so, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=794)|
| 0:13:18| I've been a reformer my entire career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=798)|
| 0:13:20| So when Dr. Ryser tasked me with this and he made his announcement on February,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=800)|
| 0:13:25| I don't remember the exact words that he said to me in that meeting or that he said to the group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=805)|
| 0:13:30| But what was clear to me is that he was calling me to use change as a lever for reform,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=810)|
| 0:13:35| which is something that I have done very successfully during the course of my career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=815)|
| 0:13:40| So my commitment before I enter into this slide is to attack this with the same energy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=820)|
| 0:13:46| that I've attacked every other change initiative I've been a part of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=826)|
| 0:13:49| no different than the Region 5 way or redesigning a high school or taking over a special day school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=829)|
| 0:13:55| Any of the initiatives I've been part of have been what I wake up thinking about every single morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=835)|
| 0:14:01| So I am going to be committed to this work, and I am going to get my team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=841)|
| 0:14:04| and we're going to find a way to make Knox County Schools the model for special education in our state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=844)|
| 0:14:11| So in the next year, I intend to work with our special education department to develop systems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=851)|
| 0:14:15| and structures to ensure decisions are made by those closest to the student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=855)|
| 0:14:20| We're going to reimagine central office support because support should feel like support, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=860)|
| 0:14:26| So we want to reframe how we support our teachers, our students, and our families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=866)|
| 0:14:31| I'm going to personally pulse check our systems by sitting in on IEP meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=871)|
| 0:14:36| and other meetings related to the IEP team process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=876)|
| 0:14:39| We listed manifestation determination, but there are a lot of various ways that I can pulse check through meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=879)|
| 0:14:44| and also visiting classrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=884)|
| 0:14:46| We're going to listen to and collaborate with our families and our teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=886)|
| 0:14:49| So when I go and I sit in on an IEP team meeting, it is not going to be to sit there and be like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=889)|
| 0:14:54| well, this was a really good meeting or this wasn't a really good meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=894)|
| 0:14:57| It's really going to be to have the opportunity to hear from the people on the ground what's going well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=897)|
| 0:15:02| Is the philosophy that we're trying to shift or the paradigms that we're trying to shift actually taking hold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=902)|
| 0:15:07| down to the school level?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=907)|
| 0:15:09| Are we building capacity to make those decisions closest to the student?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=909)|
| 0:15:13| Because if we're not, then we need to change our approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=913)|
| 0:15:17| And again, as I said earlier, our work in student success will never be finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=917)|
| 0:15:22| A little-known fact, our child find numbers have doubled since the 19-20 school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=922)|
| 0:15:29| Child find is the mechanism through which we identify kids with disabilities, for those who aren't sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=929)|
| 0:15:34| But our work is never done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=934)|
| 0:15:36| We are never going to arrive, and we're going to remain committed to success for every student,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=936)|
| 0:15:41| and that's going to be core to our mission moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=941)|
| 0:15:46| Again, we didn't want to just sit and wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=946)|
| 0:15:49| First of all, it's not in my nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=949)|
| 0:15:51| Dr. Adams reminded me just before then how impatient I am, and it felt like he was saying it in a kind way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=951)|
| 0:15:57| But we haven't just sat and waited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=957)|
| 0:15:59| We didn't sit and wait in Region 5, and we're not going to sit and wait now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=959)|
| 0:16:02| So we've taken action along the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=962)|
| 0:16:05| One of the first things we did was we created and implemented a policy to allow private practitioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=965)|
| 0:16:09| to provide support to students in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=969)|
| 0:16:12| We established modification resources to enhance our inclusion practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=972)|
| 0:16:18| We implemented a new process for monitoring and improving our LRE rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=978)|
| 0:16:23| and we improved our reading intervention supports for children with disabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=983)|
| 0:16:27| And this is only the start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=987)|
| 0:16:31| Tonight, to back up my words, because at this point in my career,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=991)|
| 0:16:35| I understand the perception is mostly I'm a talking head for the district, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=995)|
| 0:16:39| Words don't mean a whole lot, but actions do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=999)|
| 0:16:42| So tonight we're backing up our words with six specific action steps that we are going to take immediately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1002)|
| 0:16:48| and I'm going to ask the Board of Education for their support in the vote on Thursday for two of those action steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1008)|
| 0:16:56| First, coming in January 24, because we do want to make sure that we're casting a wide net to get input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1016)|
| 0:17:03| we're going to launch the KCS way for special education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1023)|
| 0:17:06| If you get in your DeLorean back in time, you'll remember the Region 5 way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1026)|
| 0:17:10| The Region 5 way, that's our road map for how we're going to meet the needs of kids in Region 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1030)|
| 0:17:14| The KCS way for special education will be the road map to establish high expectations for all staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1034)|
| 0:17:20| Again, starting with me through every level of our organization to ensure that everybody is on the same page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1040)|
| 0:17:26| Again, I view this as the work of everyone, and for us to get better, we have to raise the bar for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1046)|
| 0:17:33| We're going to have clear customer service and communication guidelines for all staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1053)|
| 0:17:37| clear expectations on staff training, support, and professional development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1057)|
| 0:17:41| and hopefully culminating in an improved IEP experience for families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1061)|
| 0:17:46| As part of this project, we're going to collaborate with the Office of the Ombudsman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1066)|
| 0:17:50| and our special education family liaison to really help us dig in and find those opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1070)|
| 0:17:55| to become more consistent in our communication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1075)|
| 0:18:03| To enhance our protocols and practice, I'm asking the Board of Education to consider a contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1083)|
| 0:18:07| to provide staffing support to our schools in the form of educational assistance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1087)|
| 0:18:11| and hard-to-staff service providers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1091)|
| 0:18:13| I was really happy when I heard the task force make a recommendation around a staffing solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1093)|
| 0:18:19| I do think that we have to be forward-thinking in how we address these challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1099)|
| 0:18:25| What this contract doesn't do is it doesn't obligate us to any particular expenditure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1105)|
| 0:18:32| over the course of the contract, nor does it obligate the other entity to, quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1112)|
| 0:18:37| fully staff us, so I don't want it to be conflated with the custodial contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1117)|
| 0:18:43| What this does is it gives us another tool to face the challenges around staffing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1123)|
| 0:18:49| and put us in a better position to make sure that students are getting their services in a timely way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1129)|
| 0:18:54| and hopefully relieve some of the stress that our current staff are currently feeling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1134)|
| 0:18:59| by having to cover all these various spots where we're short-staffed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1139)|
| 0:19:06| Expanded coaching and training for all staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1146)|
| 0:19:08| Again, we saw this in our teacher input portal and from the special ed task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1148)|
| 0:19:13| I'm committed to identifying outside partners to provide technical assistance in the following areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1153)|
| 0:19:18| staff training and professional development, inclusion, and behavioral supports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1158)|
| 0:19:23| Again, all, all staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1163)|
| 0:19:26| We're all going to visit what our philosophies are in these areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1166)|
| 0:19:30| What is our why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1170)|
| 0:19:31| Why do we believe inclusion, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1171)|
| 0:19:33| Like, we need to have those conversations and have some outside expertise to help us along the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1173)|
| 0:19:41| In the development of a student-first school-level strategy for decision-making,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1181)|
| 0:19:45| it's going to be important for us to assess our existing systems and structures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1185)|
| 0:19:49| so I'm launching an input portal for our school leaders and all teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1189)|
| 0:19:54| We've not yet heard from our school leaders, nor have we heard from our gen-ed colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1194)|
| 0:19:58| And again, for us to be successful and have long-term sustainable change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1198)|
| 0:20:03| we need to hear those voices and see what gaps need to be closed from their perspectives as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1203)|
| 0:20:09| So we're going to be launching that pronto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1209)|
| 0:20:16| I'll be asking the Board of Education for their support on this one as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1216)|
| 0:20:20| in an attempt to build greater capacity for continuous improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1220)|
| 0:20:23| I'm asking the Board to approve funding to hire a student success accountability officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1223)|
| 0:20:27| This position would report directly to the assistant superintendent of student success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1227)|
| 0:20:32| The goal would be to provide insight around legal trends, laws, and best practices in serving special pops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1232)|
| 0:20:39| So this would not be just in the realm of special education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1239)|
| 0:20:42| but this person would also be guiding our work for English language learners, Section 504, bullying and harassment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1242)|
| 0:20:50| all the legal issues that are sort of housed in the Division of Student Success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1250)|
| 0:20:55| This person would also collaborate directly with the assistant superintendent of student success| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1255)|
| 0:20:59| regarding any potential legal issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1259)|
| 0:21:07| And finally, collaborating with families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1267)|
| 0:21:09| I'm committing tonight to developing a framework for a council to provide insight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1269)|
| 0:21:13| and lend perspective into our continuous improvement initiatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1273)|
| 0:21:17| This will be comprised of parents and caregivers of our students with disabilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1277)|
| 0:21:20| educators from the special ed side and the gen ed side, as well as KCS administrators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1280)|
| 0:21:26| I'm committing this council to be ongoing and meet on a regular basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1286)|
| 0:21:30| probably mirroring similar to what we do with our family councils in our regions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1290)|
| 0:21:39| So as I wrap up, I want to just reinforce that I'm excited about the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1299)|
| 0:21:44| to bring about change and reform to special ed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1304)|
| 0:21:47| But cultural change takes time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1307)|
| 0:21:50| We're a very large school district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1310)|
| 0:21:53| This won't happen overnight, and it won't happen without commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1313)|
| 0:21:58| So I've talked about my commitment, and we're going to get after it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1318)|
| 0:22:02| as soon as we get through this board presentation, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1322)|
| 0:22:05| We're going to get after it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1325)|
| 0:22:06| So change work is hard, but in KCS we've committed ourselves to doing the hard things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1326)|
| 0:22:12| So does anybody have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1332)|
| 0:22:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1342)|
| 0:22:24| I guess your presentation answered all of them, so there you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1344)|
| 0:22:27| I would like to thank you, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1347)|
| 0:22:30| I especially appreciate you sharing your commitment in the fly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1350)|
| 0:22:36| because I think as board members we have seen that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1356)|
| 0:22:40| But from the family standpoint, the community standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1360)|
| 0:22:43| that might have had less than desirable experiences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1363)|
| 0:22:47| they may not have seen that from the district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1367)|
| 0:22:49| and I do think it is important that people hear that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1369)|
| 0:22:52| So I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1372)|
| 0:22:55| And also I would just like to note, because I know I've gotten a lot of e-mails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1375)|
| 0:23:00| and they've been very helpful, and I hope they keep coming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1380)|
| 0:23:03| but this work isn't happening in a vacuum, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1383)|
| 0:23:06| I assume you're still coordinating all the services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1386)|
| 0:23:09| and doing all your IEP team meetings and all those things in addition to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1389)|
| 0:23:15| So it isn't going to happen overnight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1395)|
| 0:23:17| because we still have to continue to support our students and families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1397)|
| 0:23:23| in the work that we do every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1403)|
| 0:23:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1408)|
| 0:23:29| So anybody have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1409)|
| 0:23:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1412)|
| 0:23:34| So moving on to our regular agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1414)|
| 0:23:40| Let me dig it out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1420)|
| 0:23:41| I have a lot of papers tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1421)|
| 0:23:50| Any questions on 5A or B?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1430)|

| 0:26:30| We've got a lot of policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1590)|
| 0:26:31| I missed that policy reviews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1591)|
| 0:26:33| Yeah, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1593)|
| 0:26:34| You might get through the alphabet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1594)|
| 0:26:36| S or T.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1596)|
| 0:26:41| U or V.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1601)|
| 0:26:47| W or X.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1607)|
| 0:26:52| Yes, Ms. Hurdle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1612)|
| 0:26:53| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1613)|
| 0:26:55| Regarding policy X homework, I was looking over it, and everything seems great, and I feel like that's something that all the students would definitely be on board with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1615)|
| 0:27:04| However, I was just wondering how such a policy could be implemented and enforced as, say, if a teacher wasn't complying with the policy, how is a student supposed to bring that up and have their problem fixed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1624)|
| 0:27:20| That's a great question, and Dr. Wilson is not here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1640)|
| 0:27:23| So, Dr. Reiswig.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1643)|
| 0:27:26| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1646)|
| 0:27:27| I think Dr. Wilson knew you were going to ask that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1647)|
| 0:27:29| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1649)|
| 0:27:30| So, he didn't come tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1650)|
| 0:27:31| No, I'm kidding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1651)|
| 0:27:32| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1652)|
| 0:27:33| So, yeah, I would have to look closer at the policy, but what I would suggest is to make sure I got the wording right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1653)|
| 0:27:39| But I would think, you know, first, always we try to start with a conversation with the teacher, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1659)|
| 0:27:43| I mean, you probably don't bring the policy and say you're violating policy, but kind of have some kind of conversation just around, you know, that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1663)|
| 0:27:50| Sometimes I think students can also go to their parents to have that conversation because sometimes that's more of a conversation between a parent and a teacher that can happen then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1670)|
| 0:27:58| And then, ultimately, usually we see most things resolved at that level, but if not, you know, administration at the school could get involved, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1678)|
| 0:28:04| So, you know, most of the time I would think that it would probably be a good way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1684)|
| 0:28:08| I could see it depending on the age of the student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1688)|
| 0:28:10| You might not want to go to have that conversation with the teacher and the relationship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1690)|
| 0:28:13| You might want to have your parents do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1693)|
| 0:28:14| But I think some do have that relationship to be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1694)|
| 0:28:18| And most of the time I think it could probably be resolved from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1698)|
| 0:28:21| There's, you know, just looking at some of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1701)|
| 0:28:25| And, again, like a lot of these policies, sometimes there are times on a project due that might be more homework than, you know, in given times than there would be at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1705)|
| 0:28:33| But it's probably always better to start with that conversation, but ultimately probably get the school administration involved if there's two different viewpoints when that conversation happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1713)|
| 0:28:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1723)|
| 0:28:44| And just to follow up, do we communicate these out to the schools once they're approved, I assume, so that those communications can be made to the teachers and staff as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1724)|
| 0:28:55| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1735)|
| 0:28:56| Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1736)|
| 0:28:58| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1738)|
| 0:28:59| I actually don't have a question about X, but I couldn't find my note for policy N, but I did find it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1739)|
| 0:29:05| So this is the one regarding organization for instruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1745)|
| 0:29:10| On page 2, line 13, I'm wondering if there's an error there or if it's intended to say what it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1750)|
| 0:29:16| So line 12 and 13, it says high schools and the 865 academies will have a freshman academy and sophomore career themed academies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1756)|
| 0:29:24| But it's really sophomore through senior, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1764)|
| 0:29:26| So it just seems like it kind of cuts off there at sophomore, which it doesn't seem as expansive as it's intended to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1766)|
| 0:29:33| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1773)|
| 0:29:36| Thank you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1776)|
| 0:29:37| Mr. Watson, once again, Dr. Wilson, I'll get another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1777)|
| 0:29:39| So I was not here for policy review, but my guess would be since this year it's only through sophomores that we have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1779)|
| 0:29:46| I don't know if the understanding was that they're going to roll it up every year to junior and senior as that moves on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1786)|
| 0:29:51| But then we're just updating the policy every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1791)|
| 0:29:53| Could we not just say sophomore through senior now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1793)|
| 0:29:56| I mean, that is the intent is what we're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1796)|
| 0:29:59| So I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1799)|
| 0:30:00| I see Ms. Jackson standing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1800)|
| 0:30:02| Oh, there you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1802)|
| 0:30:03| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1803)|
| 0:30:04| Would you like to speak to this as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1804)|
| 0:30:08| Yeah, it may be intentional and I'm just not catching the intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1808)|
| 0:30:11| So it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1811)|
| 0:30:12| Good evening, Madam Chair, members of the board, superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1812)|
| 0:30:15| So you are correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1815)|
| 0:30:17| We were what we were anticipating is that for this year, it would be true to say that we are in the academy model for ninth and tenth graders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1817)|
| 0:30:25| And that since we go through an annual policy review next year, it would be true for us to add the eleventh graders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1825)|
| 0:30:31| And that that felt like the more accurate description for what we were saying for the current model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1831)|
| 0:30:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1837)|
| 0:30:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1838)|
| 0:30:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1839)|
| 0:30:45| Was there anything else with that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1845)|
| 0:30:47| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1847)|
| 0:30:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1848)|
| 0:30:49| So anything else with N or X?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1849)|
| 0:30:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1853)|
| 0:30:54| So moving on, Y or Z?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1854)|
| 0:30:59| A, A or B, B?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1859)|
| 0:31:04| C, C or D, D?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1864)|
| 0:31:09| Oh, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1869)|
| 0:31:11| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1871)|
| 0:31:13| On policy D, D controversial issues on I think it's just a typo, but on page one, line 36 and page two, line one, it's the same typo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1873)|
| 0:31:26| The word is C when it should be seek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1886)|
| 0:31:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1896)|
| 0:31:37| We made that notation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1897)|
| 0:31:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1899)|
| 0:31:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1902)|
| 0:31:43| Item E, E?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1903)|
| 0:31:47| Moving on to grant seven, A or B?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1907)|
| 0:31:53| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1913)|
| 0:31:54| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1914)|
| 0:31:55| Could someone just briefly go through the details of the changes here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1915)|
| 0:32:02| On A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1922)|
| 0:32:03| Seven A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1923)|
| 0:32:04| Seven A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1924)|
| 0:32:06| Ms. Himmelgaard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1926)|
| 0:32:08| Madam Chair, Ms. Owen, there are no changes to this amendment from the previous one that the board approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1928)|
| 0:32:24| So I guess the word addendum is kind of throwing me off there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1944)|
| 0:32:27| So we are just continuing as is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1947)|
| 0:32:31| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1951)|
| 0:32:32| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1952)|
| 0:32:33| We're following the timeline that the state requires for the addendum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1953)|
| 0:32:37| We do anticipate some changes in the last year to the spend plan, but there aren't any at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1957)|
| 0:32:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1965)|
| 0:32:51| So item B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1971)|
| 0:32:57| Item C or D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1977)|
| 0:33:06| E or F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1986)|
| 0:33:12| G or H.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1992)|
| 0:33:19| I or J.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=1999)|
| 0:33:26| Moving on to contracts eight, A or B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2006)|
| 0:33:34| Ms. Himmelgaard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2014)|
| 0:33:35| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2015)|
| 0:33:36| Yes, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2016)|
| 0:33:37| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2017)|
| 0:33:38| Mr. Myers reminded me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2018)|
| 0:33:39| I was referencing the spend plan specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2019)|
| 0:33:41| We did update dates for meetings with the health department in this addendum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2021)|
| 0:33:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2030)|
| 0:33:52| So contracts item A, A or B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2032)|
| 0:34:00| C or D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2040)|
| 0:34:04| Or C or C1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2044)|
| 0:34:10| C2 or C3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2050)|
| 0:34:27| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2067)|
| 0:34:28| Mine is pretty different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2068)|
| 0:34:29| Okay, so D or E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2069)|
| 0:34:32| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2072)|
| 0:34:34| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2074)|
| 0:34:36| I know you sent an email to the board relative to item E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2076)|
| 0:34:41| First, let me just say I appreciate those emails where you give some clarity and some context to specific items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2081)|
| 0:34:46| That's really helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2086)|
| 0:34:47| But I thought it would be good, since we talked a lot about the salary study, for you just to talk about that publicly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2087)|
| 0:34:52| and share anything that you want related to the addition of the classification study and what that hopefully will do for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2092)|
| 0:35:00| Thank you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2100)|
| 0:35:01| I'll actually have Ms. Himmelgaard speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2101)|
| 0:35:03| This is, I would say, support of this, because I think this is the way we do our salary schedules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2103)|
| 0:35:09| I think it's kind of unique, and this was something that we found that would be, I think, beneficial to the full study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2109)|
| 0:35:14| So go ahead, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2114)|
| 0:35:18| Yes, Madam Chair, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2118)|
| 0:35:20| This is an addition of a job class study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2120)|
| 0:35:23| So what Evergreen, the consultant, discovered in digging into our salary schedule and our position descriptions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2123)|
| 0:35:30| is that we've got a lot of positions in the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2130)|
| 0:35:33| So in addition to the salary schedule itself, we've got a lot of different positions that fit on that schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2133)|
| 0:35:39| So the job class study addition compares salaries to job duties across different position titles in different departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2139)|
| 0:35:50| So an example would be a supervisor in one department and a supervisor in another department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2150)|
| 0:35:55| They're paid on the same pay scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2155)|
| 0:35:56| Are job duties comparable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2156)|
| 0:35:58| So looking at those type things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2158)|
| 0:36:01| And with the addition of the classification study, we're still less than half what we had budgeted, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2161)|
| 0:36:06| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2166)|
| 0:36:07| Because we had budgeted around $300,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2167)|
| 0:36:08| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2168)|
| 0:36:09| It's an additional around $58,000, but still well under the $300,000 that we budgeted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2169)|
| 0:36:14| It comes in around $123,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2174)|
| 0:36:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2176)|
| 0:36:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2177)|
| 0:36:18| Ms. Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2178)|
| 0:36:19| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2179)|
| 0:36:20| I actually had the same question, so thank you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2180)|
| 0:36:22| But I also, and I appreciate that work that you guys are doing, Ms. Himmelgaard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2182)|
| 0:36:26| And I also just wanted to say, and Dr. Wilson's not here, but I'm really glad to see the contract with Junior Achievement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2186)|
| 0:36:33| And I think that's a great, great organization to utilize and hopefully be able to pull in some community support also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2193)|
| 0:36:42| So kudos for that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2202)|
| 0:36:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2210)|
| 0:36:51| So any discussion on item F, 8F?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2211)|
| 0:36:56| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2216)|
| 0:36:58| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2218)|
| 0:36:59| Did you say item F?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2219)|
| 0:37:00| Mm-hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2220)|
| 0:37:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2221)|
| 0:37:02| Mr. Myers, one, thank you for the passion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2222)|
| 0:37:04| I mean, you have been in front of the board a lot when I've been on the board, and that was definitely the most passionate you've been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2224)|
| 0:37:10| I really appreciate you kind of cracking yourself open a little bit and letting us know where you're coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2230)|
| 0:37:15| And I think it's evident in the work that you guys are putting forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2235)|
| 0:37:18| Can you go a little bit deeper into the South Central LLC contract for special education staff support?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2238)|
| 0:37:24| And you talked about how you're not seeing it in the same way as what we're doing with custodians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2244)|
| 0:37:30| But can you tell us what the intent of it is and what you hope it will help us do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2250)|
| 0:37:34| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2254)|
| 0:37:37| Thanks, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2257)|
| 0:37:38| Yeah, you know, in terms of the particulars of the contract and the who's and the what's and all that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2258)|
| 0:37:44| I would probably defer to my colleague, Ms. Himmelgaard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2264)|
| 0:37:47| But the why is to make sure that we can get students the services they need in a way that is timely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2267)|
| 0:37:55| so that we're not in a position where we're having to deliver services during extended school year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2275)|
| 0:38:00| to remediate some of the lack of services during the school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2280)|
| 0:38:04| It puts us in a stronger position to meet the needs of kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2284)|
| 0:38:06| And I think where I see this as different is neither party is committing to anything other than this is an additional tool for us to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2286)|
| 0:38:14| So we're not coming into this contract saying we're going to spend a million dollars with this company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2294)|
| 0:38:19| and they're going to fill all of our vacancies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2299)|
| 0:38:22| This is just to give us another tool to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2302)|
| 0:38:25| And I think in terms of the need, which is where I kind of live,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2305)|
| 0:38:31| so I referenced in the presentation that our child fine numbers had nearly doubled since 1920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2311)|
| 0:38:39| And we've added positions in every budget cycle to the school psych department since back when I was the executive director until this last budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2319)|
| 0:38:47| Whether it's school psychs or diagnosticians, if you name it, we've added it to try and keep up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2327)|
| 0:38:54| We're currently down five psych positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2334)|
| 0:38:58| And I talk about child fine because that's a really easy, tangible thing because we monitor that number very carefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2338)|
| 0:39:05| But in the grand scheme of things, that's actually not even entirely the role of our school psychs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2345)|
| 0:39:12| As you start thinking about the demands that are placed on them as it relates to conducting manifestation determinations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2352)|
| 0:39:17| whether it's about student behavior or it's about attendance or it's doing 504 or participating in 504 evaluations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2357)|
| 0:39:24| They are a system that has been essentially overrun because we can't find enough people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2364)|
| 0:39:31| When I look at the SLPs and the number of hours that our SLPs are being asked to deliver on has increased by a little more than a thousand more hours compared to the 1920 school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2371)|
| 0:39:46| So when we start thinking about what might have the impact been for schools not to be open for a while, what might those lasting effects be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2386)|
| 0:39:53| From a special ed perspective, and we start thinking about some of these young folks coming into the school system, I think we're starting very much to see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2393)|
| 0:40:03| So for SLP perspective, we're down three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2403)|
| 0:40:09| But what that represents is eight schools who don't have a specifically assigned SLP, which means our, back to the burden on our current staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2409)|
| 0:40:15| that means our existing SLPs are dividing their time even more so that they can go and try to provide services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2415)|
| 0:40:23| So to me, the why is we've got to try something because I've been in special ed, as I referenced earlier, for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2423)|
| 0:40:33| And when I came to Knox County, I benefited from things like signing bonuses for tough-to-staff positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2433)|
| 0:40:39| We still have that practice in KCS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2439)|
| 0:40:45| Some of our educational assistants are eligible for stipends and supplements and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2445)|
| 0:40:52| This is just a really complex one, and I think that to solve issues in the current job market, I think we have to think about the solutions a little differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2452)|
| 0:41:01| And I think that the more tools that we can have in our toolbox to address these shortages, the better off we're going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2461)|
| 0:41:07| I think this contract is also unique in that it includes the potential to be able to capture more educational assistants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2467)|
| 0:41:14| And for reference, we have 60 vacancies in our TAs right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2474)|
| 0:41:20| The person at her desk has a request from the special ed department to add 11 more to try and support the work we're doing around inclusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2480)|
| 0:41:28| And for all intents and purposes, there are no applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2488)|
| 0:41:34| So if you're listening and you would like to be a TA, hit us up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2494)|
| 0:41:40| This contract doesn't give up our obligation to go out and recruit people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2500)|
| 0:41:46| It just gives us an additional tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2506)|
| 0:41:52| I'm just trying to understand how the tool works. I don't think it's about making it easier for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2512)|
| 0:41:58| But the ESS South Central LLC, do they already have people with these credentials on their staff that they would place with us, or are they just head hunting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2518)|
| 0:42:04| Are they another group that's helping get people that will come through a pipeline?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2524)|
| 0:42:10| And I'm going to have Jennifer address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2530)|
| 0:42:16| Madam Chair, Mr. Watson, that was my answer. It's a little bit of both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2536)|
| 0:42:22| Do they currently have on staff the amount of people to fill all of our 63 SPED educational assistant vacancies and the school psychologists and SLPs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2542)|
| 0:42:30| I'm not sure that they do with the specialized area, the school psychs and the SLPs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2550)|
| 0:42:36| But like Mr. Meyer said, it is another tool to work towards filling those vacancies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2556)|
| 0:42:45| Correct. And like Mr. Meyer said, we will not stop recruiting for these positions as well and attempting to fill them with KCS employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2565)|
| 0:42:53| It doesn't necessarily matter, but I'm curious because I've never heard of them. Are they local?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2573)|
| 0:42:59| Yes. They have a local office, but they are not only local.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2579)|
| 0:43:05| And what are the people that are already on their staff, do they do any direct service themselves or are they placed with other companies all over the place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2585)|
| 0:43:15| I would have to get more information from them on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2595)|
| 0:43:21| I guess what I'm curious is are they more of a pass-through company where it's not a direct service provider or are they providing direct services, but they also have additional staff that they can essentially loan out, I guess, to other companies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2601)|
| 0:43:28| We can get more information. I don't know that I have the answer to those specifically, and I think that the answer may be different for the different specialties, so the school psychs and speech-language paths versus the educational assistants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2608)|
| 0:43:46| I can see if Mr. Bolden has those specifics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2626)|
| 0:43:53| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2633)|
| 0:43:59| Ms. Himelgaard, will the employees be our employees or their employees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2639)|
| 0:44:05| They'll be their employees. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2645)|
| 0:44:12| All right. Any other questions or discussion on that item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2652)|
| 0:44:19| Moving to regular agenda items, item 9A or B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2659)|
| 0:44:25| Reverend Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2665)|
| 0:44:32| Thank you, Madam Chair. I'm sorry, but I was wanting to ask, as you all use acronyms, SLP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2672)|
| 0:44:39| Speech-language pathologists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2679)|
| 0:44:45| Okay. I heard SLP about 57 times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2685)|
| 0:44:51| Yeah. Sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2691)|
| 0:44:57| Thank you. I just hope I wasn't the only one who didn't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2697)|
| 0:45:04| All right. So item 9, regular agenda items A or B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2704)|
| 0:45:14| C or D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2714)|
| 0:45:20| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2720)|
| 0:45:26| I appreciate Mr. Myers asking for the position in D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2726)|
| 0:45:33| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2733)|
| 0:45:39| I do have some concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2739)|
| 0:45:45| And the main concern is that when I look historically at things that have happened in Knox County schools, what I see is that groups of parents bring us an issue and bring us a proposed solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2745)|
| 0:45:52| And it seems that we always adopt that solution in a little different way than the way it is proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2752)|
| 0:46:02| And it always seems to be a way that is less helpful than intended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2762)|
| 0:46:09| An example would be when our DEO committee suggested that we have ombudspersons for special education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2769)|
| 0:46:21| And for general education, it was suggested that the ombudsman be a position that was outside of Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2781)|
| 0:46:30| So that that person was not under the direct supervision of the same people that the ombudsman was supposed to be potentially challenging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2790)|
| 0:46:37| And that seems to be the same recommendation that has come from the current committee, is the recommendation is for someone outside of Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2797)|
| 0:46:54| And in each of these instances, and in other instances that I've watched over time, what tends to happen is that we bring in a group of people that are outside of Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2814)|
| 0:47:06| And we bring in this position and it starts out as a position that is working for correction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2826)|
| 0:47:16| But eventually it becomes a position that is just sort of absorbed into the bureaucracy so that it isn't really effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2836)|
| 0:47:27| And I'm trying to do it really diplomatically but the words that I have are not very diplomatic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2847)|
| 0:47:37| What begins as really genuinely supportive position eventually rolls into something that becomes more of a covering position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2857)|
| 0:47:56| Because it's not outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2876)|
| 0:48:02| It's not a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2882)|
| 0:48:08| When we have more people who answer to the people who seem to be part of the issues, that's not helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2888)|
| 0:48:18| If we're looking for accountability, we need to be looking for some outside accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2898)|
| 0:48:25| The reasons that we're looking at this position very much seem to be the same reasons that we were looking at an ombudsperson when we first brought that position in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2905)|
| 0:48:36| And if that position were working, I don't think this would be the same recommendation that's coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2916)|
| 0:48:42| So that's my concern. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2922)|
| 0:48:48| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2928)|
| 0:48:54| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2934)|
| 0:49:00| One, I appreciate being able to see the job description in advance and read through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2940)|
| 0:49:06| I didn't have any questions about this, but I'm trying to listen to Ms. Owen and try to understand what the dynamics could be and I don't have as much history on the board as she does for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2946)|
| 0:49:12| And, you know, I don't have as much history on the board as she does for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2952)|
| 0:49:17| I think there's a balance in that when you have somebody who's completely outside of a system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2957)|
| 0:49:23| and it's hard to get that person's attention when you need them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2963)|
| 0:49:29| It's also they're kind of always playing that consultant role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2969)|
| 0:49:34| They can't really have eyes on as much as they need to when they need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2974)|
| 0:49:39| So I think that's one downside of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2979)|
| 0:49:42| But also, too, I understand in a system that depending on who you answer to over time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2982)|
| 0:49:48| whether or not that person that you're answering to wants you to behave in this way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2988)|
| 0:49:53| sometimes you just end up behaving that way and you end up telling people what you feel like they want to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2993)|
| 0:49:58| Now, obviously, this person, their ethics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=2998)|
| 0:50:01| based upon the experience that we're looking for and their background and all that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3001)|
| 0:50:05| should prevent them from doing that and they should be willing to say the hard things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3005)|
| 0:50:09| I mean, that's what we're basically asking them to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3009)|
| 0:50:12| But I'm wondering if there was thought about this person directly answering to Dr. Ryswick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3012)|
| 0:50:18| And that's nothing against Jason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3018)|
| 0:50:20| I'm just wondering if this is somebody who's supposed to put the ultimate check on one of our core four priorities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3020)|
| 0:50:29| like they're the one, like they're the one who's like constantly holding up the mirror.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3029)|
| 0:50:34| And what we've said, and this is no fault of the law department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3034)|
| 0:50:37| it's just the way the law department in Knox County and with Knox County Schools is structured,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3037)|
| 0:50:43| is that sometimes it's hard to both be the one that's defending us but also holding up the mirror too, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3043)|
| 0:50:48| We're saying this is what we want this person doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3048)|
| 0:50:51| I mean, if I was in your seat, I mean, ultimately, I would want them to hold that mirror up to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3051)|
| 0:50:56| So I'm wondering if there was thought or conversation about that person directly answering to you instead of to Mr. Myers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3056)|
| 0:51:05| Madam Chair, thank you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3065)|
| 0:51:06| No, a lot of thought went into thinking through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3066)|
| 0:51:10| And, you know, for us, I think it becomes a matter of expertise, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3070)|
| 0:51:16| We had great meetings with the law department, with David Boock and with Mike Mogers and with Gary Dupler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3076)|
| 0:51:23| just what you said, defining roles and responsibilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3083)|
| 0:51:27| And we really left there with a great consensus of kind of where things were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3087)|
| 0:51:31| It was really clear from the end of our conversation that decisions to go to litigation or not rest in the superintendent's decision for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3091)|
| 0:51:41| And so we all met that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3101)|
| 0:51:43| I mean, I think we kind of walked in not knowing where we'd be, and we all kind of quickly were like, yeah, that's how it should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3103)|
| 0:51:49| So then agreeing that and taking that responsibility for me or whoever's in the seat down the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3109)|
| 0:51:54| then comes the level of expertise that I would need and or my team would need in order to make that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3114)|
| 0:52:00| So there is a portion of this job that's accountability to make sure we're fulfilling all those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3120)|
| 0:52:05| But there's also a piece that talks about when a situation arises, the ability to, you know, look horizontally at other groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3125)|
| 0:52:13| other people to see what kind of best practices and trends are happening out there so we can make a better decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3133)|
| 0:52:18| And then exactly as you said, if it's something that we say, yeah, we feel good about going to litigation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3138)|
| 0:52:23| we then work with the law department because they will be representing us when it comes to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3143)|
| 0:52:27| I think we thought a lot about this kind of like the way the Title IX, I know that's driven by state law now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3147)|
| 0:52:32| but Chekovia, who's on our team, is a Title IX expert, worked at a university level to see that happen, really brought to us an expertise level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3152)|
| 0:52:39| We all had opinions, right, on, you know, this should be done or that should be done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3159)|
| 0:52:43| and we work as a team with Ryan Brown and with facilities and Gary's part of that team too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3163)|
| 0:52:48| But ultimately we didn't have somebody who that's what they were trained to do and had done that in the field, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3168)|
| 0:52:53| So for us it's really more about building that capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3173)|
| 0:52:57| And so the way those decisions will be made, whether we move forward or not, will be with me and Jason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3177)|
| 0:53:04| So I need Jason's expertise to help me as an advisor as well as I do all the assistant superintendents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3184)|
| 0:53:09| So there won't be a decision made that I won't be making that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3189)|
| 0:53:13| It's just there's some of those things that are kind of day-to-day things that Jason has knowledge of already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3193)|
| 0:53:19| We meet weekly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3199)|
| 0:53:20| We have scheduled one-on-ones, and he brings those things to me and says, here's where we are with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3200)|
| 0:53:24| and, you know, here's what we think we should do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3204)|
| 0:53:27| We think that person's that other voice to be able to say, you know, what are they doing in Chattanooga?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3207)|
| 0:53:31| What are they doing in someplace else too that might be a practice or we can look at that way to make that decision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3211)|
| 0:53:37| So even if it were reported to me, I would bring in Jason into that conversation, and ultimately it's my decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3217)|
| 0:53:43| Yeah, I guess that's where I'm at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3223)|
| 0:53:45| I mean, I get the why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3225)|
| 0:53:46| I totally appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3226)|
| 0:53:49| And I would think that you would make the decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3229)|
| 0:53:51| So if even a person that answers to you can still advise another department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3231)|
| 0:53:57| so I guess can you just summarize the why not answer to you directly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3237)|
| 0:54:04| Good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3244)|
| 0:54:05| You know, there are pieces of that too that, like when it goes to litigation, obviously I would be involved with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3245)|
| 0:54:12| But there are some just basic pieces and ideas that, you know, Jason's charged to run in the department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3252)|
| 0:54:17| So I think he would use that person as well to kind of look through things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3257)|
| 0:54:21| And, you know, there may be stuff that's not litigation that comes to me that they're just looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3261)|
| 0:54:25| He's done a good job laying out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3265)|
| 0:54:27| Tonight I feel that, you know, we understand families' experience with the special ed departments, that IEP meeting, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3267)|
| 0:54:34| That's where they get, just like we say, a regular or general ed or all students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3274)|
| 0:54:38| It's kind of what happens in that car line, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3278)|
| 0:54:40| But an IEP is a unique experience for them to have a look at the special ed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3280)|
| 0:54:44| He's going to be working to re-drive that whole culture with that being the centerpiece and building all of our structures and supports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3284)|
| 0:54:50| I think this person will be a great help to them as well, looking at those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3290)|
| 0:54:54| So although I might be involved in the litigation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3294)|
| 0:54:57| there's probably 50 percent of the other parts of the job that he'll be doing with them on day in, day out to work through those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3297)|
| 0:55:02| When it comes to litigation or not, then that's when I think we'd be brought in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3302)|
| 0:55:06| So I'd be brought into those conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3306)|
| 0:55:09| Jason does a good job keeping me abreast of that right now when it comes through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3309)|
| 0:55:13| But really I think it's something I feel he can manage and they can manage because some of the job won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3313)|
| 0:55:19| Every day it's not going to be a litigation question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3319)|
| 0:55:21| There's going to be a lot of accountability he's talked about with ELL and with RTI implementation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3321)|
| 0:55:26| and those kinds of things that will be conversations that I want to see and need to be involved in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3326)|
| 0:55:30| So I think it's a better fit for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3330)|
| 0:55:35| And I'll just echo real quick what Dr. Ryslick said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3335)|
| 0:55:38| I did sit in with that meeting with Mr. Dupler and David Buick about this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3338)|
| 0:55:46| And like Gary, I think we all went in wondering how it was going to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3346)|
| 0:55:50| because we really weren't sure where everyone was, especially right after the recommendations came out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3350)|
| 0:55:59| But I left feeling really good about it in that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3359)|
| 0:56:02| I felt like, and I'll even add that a situation came up at the end of last week that I had to reach out to Jason about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3362)|
| 0:56:11| And it was kind of an unusual situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3371)|
| 0:56:15| But I was thinking at that time, well, would it be helpful to have this person to be able to ask this question to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3375)|
| 0:56:24| because I had some legal questions about it and just questions about our practices and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3384)|
| 0:56:33| And I guess in my mind I was seeing that like that being a good situation to have that person on staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3393)|
| 0:56:41| that I could directly reach out to along with Jason about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3401)|
| 0:56:46| Ms. Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3406)|
| 0:56:47| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3407)|
| 0:56:49| It seems like that with the limitations we have with the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3409)|
| 0:56:54| that this would be a good compromise to satisfy and keep us within the Knox County Charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3414)|
| 0:57:00| and satisfy the need and the additional eyes so that it is two different perspectives that are looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3420)|
| 0:57:09| what the law department typically sees and then just from the other perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3429)|
| 0:57:16| And that it really would come down to the perspective of this individual and the expertise that this person brings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3436)|
| 0:57:22| So I would assume that that was a big part of the conversation is the limitation that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3442)|
| 0:57:26| that this board has due to our Knox County Charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3446)|
| 0:57:29| Would that be, is that fair to say, Mr. Dupler, if you want to talk about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3449)|
| 0:57:34| But, I mean, to me this just seemed like a good compromise because it kind of satisfies the need on both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3454)|
| 0:57:45| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3465)|
| 0:57:46| Ms. Horn, I don't know that I would call it a compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3466)|
| 0:57:50| I mean, what the conversation was about was if the administration, if Dr. Reiswick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3470)|
| 0:57:58| and him making the recommendation to the board and the board would like to hire an individual with these qualifications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3478)|
| 0:58:06| you know, what would that look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3486)|
| 0:58:09| Dr. Reiswick, you know, indicated that he wanted to make, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3489)|
| 0:58:12| he's been wanting to make some changes, you know, in this area for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3492)|
| 0:58:16| And this was, you know, all part of the progression of working on those changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3496)|
| 0:58:21| So, you know, and our response was that, you know, our role is to advise when the board needs it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3501)|
| 0:58:30| when the administration needs it, and to litigate if it comes to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3510)|
| 0:58:34| You know, another thing that was discussed was that of the interactions with special ed education children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3514)|
| 0:58:44| and families, the vast, vast majority do not end up in litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3524)|
| 0:58:51| So, you know, I think that's probably one of the most, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3531)|
| 0:58:57| one of the highest reasons that the board may want to employ an individual like this is to monitor the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3537)|
| 0:59:06| all these other interactions that the law department would not have, you know, an interaction with to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3546)|
| 0:59:13| So I think that's, and without, as you indicated, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3553)|
| 0:59:18| there's a lot of attorney-client privilege and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3558)|
| 0:59:21| But, I mean, I think in general that's what I could relay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3561)|
| 0:59:25| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3565)|
| 0:59:27| And I'll just add to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3567)|
| 0:59:29| Part of my conversation and concerns were when we go to people in the law department with issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3569)|
| 0:59:40| being the people that defend us, they are looking through this at a lens of, is this legally defendable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3580)|
| 0:59:46| You know, can we defend this in court?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3586)|
| 0:59:49| And from my perspective, I don't feel like everything needs to go that far, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3589)|
| 0:59:56| I feel like there's a whole other layer we need to be looking at first, I guess, is where I was coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3596)|
| 1:00:07| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3607)|
| 1:00:08| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3608)|
| 1:00:10| I want to be clear that I'm not speaking necessarily against the position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3610)|
| 1:00:14| I'm speaking against the structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3614)|
| 1:00:16| And in looking at the structure, I'm not looking at Dr. Roswick or Jason Miner's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3616)|
| 1:00:24| What I'm looking at is the overall structure of, does this person have the freedom to say what they need to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3624)|
| 1:00:32| If I were sitting here right now as an employee of Knox County Schools, I might not feel free to say what I need to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3632)|
| 1:00:41| I might not feel free to critique completely honestly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3641)|
| 1:00:49| When I'm talking to the person who has the ultimate ability to fire everyone in the district, I might not say exactly what I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3649)|
| 1:00:59| Sitting here in my position now, I can say exactly what I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3659)|
| 1:01:04| Because, you know, no one in this room can fire me for saying what I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3664)|
| 1:01:09| I can make people mad, but you can't fire me for saying what I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3669)|
| 1:01:14| It's very different if my position is specifically to tell you what I think, and I may not feel that I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3674)|
| 1:01:24| And that has nothing to do with who is in administration right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3684)|
| 1:01:30| We don't know who will be in administration in the future and how that could play out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3690)|
| 1:01:38| If we are looking at adding a position specifically to ensure that the needs of students are being considered appropriately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3698)|
| 1:01:51| that position needs to have some oversight from somewhere besides the people that they are supposed to be critiquing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3711)|
| 1:02:01| So that's my issue with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3721)|
| 1:02:03| However, I want to point out something else that's somewhat important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3723)|
| 1:02:08| A couple months ago, we were looking at policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3728)|
| 1:02:12| And at that time, we had a policy that said that this board was to approve all new supervisory and administrative positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3732)|
| 1:02:22| And we threw away that policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3742)|
| 1:02:25| And instead, we have a job descriptions policy that now says the board shall approve the broad purpose and function of each position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3745)|
| 1:02:33| as recommended by the director of schools through the approval of the budget and in accordance with state law, etc., etc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3753)|
| 1:02:41| So we created a policy that I talked about at the time being constraining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3761)|
| 1:02:49| It says that we shall approve the function of each position in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3769)|
| 1:02:56| It's not budget time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3776)|
| 1:02:58| So that's an issue as well, is that we have created a policy that doesn't really allow us to do what we're being asked to do right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3778)|
| 1:03:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3788)|
| 1:03:12| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3792)|
| 1:03:15| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3795)|
| 1:03:16| I want to be clear, too, that I'm all for the position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3796)|
| 1:03:19| And even though Ms. Owens' comments made me think about my potential concern, it's a different concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3799)|
| 1:03:26| And the title that's being presented is student success accountability officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3806)|
| 1:03:32| And Mr. Myers' title is superintendent of student success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3812)|
| 1:03:37| So if the student success accountability officer is supposed to hold that department accountable, it's very hard to do that if you answer to the lead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3817)|
| 1:03:45| I would be saying this no matter who's sitting in Jason's position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3825)|
| 1:03:48| This is not about Jason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3828)|
| 1:03:50| It doesn't matter who's sitting in that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3830)|
| 1:03:52| But to me, the function of that position is to help hold that department accountable to everything that we're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3832)|
| 1:03:58| They would need to ultimately answer to you, I would think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3838)|
| 1:04:01| And, you know, it's ultimately, Dr. Eisenwig, I don't feel like it's my role as a board member to get in the weeds about how you structure the organizational hierarchy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3841)|
| 1:04:10| I just think it's something to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3850)|
| 1:04:13| Because I do think – I mean, I've been in situations where people don't always want to say something to their direct report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3853)|
| 1:04:22| And if you're calling this person a student success accountability officer, they should know that's part of their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3862)|
| 1:04:27| But they would need to know – there would have to be some way that they need to know they can jump over Jason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3867)|
| 1:04:33| They should feel like they can do that, that they should be able to do that and go directly to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3873)|
| 1:04:38| Because if they don't – and, again, this is not about Jason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3878)|
| 1:04:41| It doesn't matter who's sitting in that seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3881)|
| 1:04:43| If the person at the top – Jason said earlier in his presentation about leading from the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3883)|
| 1:04:47| If something's broken at the front and this person is there to help point it out, but he's answering to the person who's at the front –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3887)|
| 1:04:56| do you see what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3896)|
| 1:04:57| That's difficult, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3897)|
| 1:04:58| I think it could be difficult depending on the person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3898)|
| 1:05:02| Ms. Spike?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3902)|
| 1:05:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3907)|
| 1:05:10| Related to this job description and stuff like that, my questions are a little bit different than I see in concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3910)|
| 1:05:19| I see education experience qualifications, and we just heard Mr. Myers give a very compelling speech about his experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3919)|
| 1:05:30| with all of this stuff, but what I don't see in the job experience is that they would also have any on-the-job experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3930)|
| 1:05:37| in working in special education and directly with those people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3937)|
| 1:05:42| It would be my fear that while they have gone to law school or potentially five years of experience with legal issues –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3942)|
| 1:05:52| and it says related to special populations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3952)|
| 1:05:56| That seems a little vague to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3956)|
| 1:05:58| I would be concerned that this is a person that's just going to make sure that we're meeting the law and not exceeding the law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3958)|
| 1:06:04| and that's one of my big concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3964)|
| 1:06:11| Mr. Triplett?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3971)|
| 1:06:12| Just a couple questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3972)|
| 1:06:13| One, who's handling this position now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3973)|
| 1:06:19| Who's doing that work now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3979)|
| 1:06:25| Madam Chair, Mr. Triplett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3985)|
| 1:06:27| I think Myers Comprehensive is better, but Dr. Loy and the Executive Director of Special Education for that part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3987)|
| 1:06:39| We have other folks in ELL, also in RTI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=3999)|
| 1:06:42| I like to run those, Alicia Jones and her team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4002)|
| 1:06:45| They all work, obviously, with Jason as well, looking at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4005)|
| 1:06:49| As Mr. Dupre has laid out, there is consultation for advice from the law department in some of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4009)|
| 1:06:57| I think, again, I get the good fortune of working with everybody in this district office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4017)|
| 1:07:03| and I know how hard they work for kids every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4023)|
| 1:07:06| I think sometimes over time things happen, and probably people get close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4026)|
| 1:07:14| I think it was a good time for us to reset some of the roles with the law department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4034)|
| 1:07:19| everyone who's been involved in those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230905?start=4039)|
