| 2:36:51| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9411)|
| 2:36:53| On the recommendation of Knox County Department of Engineering and Public Works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9413)|
| 2:36:56| may increase the maximum grade allowable on a street up to 15 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9416)|
| 2:36:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9419)|
| 2:37:00| My apologies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9420)|
| 2:37:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9421)|
| 2:37:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9423)|
| 2:37:04| Hold that thought and I'll come back to that in just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9424)|
| 2:37:09| Ms. Brooks, kind of like I think I guess it was Commissioner Smith's question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9429)|
| 2:37:19| and let's just use a round number because this is 29.33 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9439)|
| 2:37:23| Let's just round it up to 30 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9443)|
| 2:37:26| If the slope is so high on the property that you cannot build homes on all 30 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9446)|
| 2:37:33| but you can only build it on, say, 10 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9453)|
| 2:37:36| that means that based on the two units per acre that would be 60 homes on 10 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9456)|
| 2:37:43| If you went to three homes per acre, that's 90 homes on 10 acres of ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9463)|
| 2:37:50| So what I wanted to do is for some of our new commissioners to understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9470)|
| 2:37:53| that just because it's a 30-acre tract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9473)|
| 2:37:55| doesn't mean that all 30 acres are going to have residential homes on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9475)|
| 2:37:59| You're going to have to cluster those in only the slope areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9479)|
| 2:38:03| that are applicable for those homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9483)|
| 2:38:05| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9485)|
| 2:38:09| So I will say that these are just recommendations in terms of the disturbance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9489)|
| 2:38:14| It's not a requirement in terms of, you know, if we don't look at the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9494)|
| 2:38:19| and say you can't disturb this site and you can't disturb this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9499)|
| 2:38:22| it is a recommendation that you stay off of those steeper slopes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9502)|
| 2:38:27| and focus your development on the non-hill side and those lower percentages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9507)|
| 2:38:33| Right, but you're not going to build a home on a 25% slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9513)|
| 2:38:36| I doubt it, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9516)|
| 2:38:38| Right, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9518)|
| 2:38:39| So you would have clustered, the housing units will be clustered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9519)|
| 2:38:44| and hence actually the density is higher on those usable, buildable acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9524)|
| 2:38:49| Yes, and so that's one of the benefits of the plan residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9529)|
| 2:38:51| is that you have that flexibility to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9531)|
| 2:38:53| Okay, great. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9533)|
| 2:38:54| Commissioner Busley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9534)|
| 2:38:56| Thank you, Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9536)|
| 2:38:59| Mr. Snowden, I've got some questions for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9539)|
| 2:39:03| We're talking about sinkholes here too on that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9543)|
| 2:39:06| and they talk about some other things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9546)|
| 2:39:08| and normally we think of sinkholes being low indentions in the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9548)|
| 2:39:14| We had a sinkhole on Greenwell Drive that was on top of a hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9554)|
| 2:39:18| and it was 60 feet across, and we don't know how deep it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9558)|
| 2:39:22| So sinkholes can come in anywhere depending upon the geological layout of the land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9562)|
| 2:39:30| and we know down certain roads that we have deposits underneath| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9570)|
| 2:39:35| that causes the sinkholes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9575)|
| 2:39:38| It's really not always the developer that causes that problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9578)|
| 2:39:41| because it's the underground water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9581)|
| 2:39:44| We have a sinkhole that's filled up with water on Beaver Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9584)|
| 2:39:48| It's called the Blue Hole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9588)|
| 2:39:50| You're familiar with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9590)|
| 2:39:51| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9591)|
| 2:39:52| Very deep hole, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9592)|
| 2:39:54| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9594)|
| 2:39:55| Made by a spring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9595)|
| 2:39:57| So, you know, we can't justify saying there could be sinkholes there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9597)|
| 2:40:03| because there are sinkholes that I see in my area that's been there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9603)|
| 2:40:08| since I've been there since 1973, fills up with water, goes away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9608)|
| 2:40:13| but it doesn't ever drop down and out and away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9613)|
| 2:40:18| and we've built houses around those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9618)|
| 2:40:20| So that shouldn't be a criteria of how we lessen the use of the land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9620)|
| 2:40:27| but we've got to take that into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9627)|
| 2:40:31| So always I've been said by some people that sinkholes start from the bottom up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9631)|
| 2:40:38| not from the top down because it has to wash away underneath some way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9638)|
| 2:40:44| get those big sinkholes that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9644)|
| 2:40:46| So I just thought I'd throw that out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9646)|
| 2:40:49| And the other thing about the density on the land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9649)|
| 2:40:53| you may do it three units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9653)|
| 2:40:56| and he might not even be able to get one-and-a-half units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9656)|
| 2:40:59| depending on what the design project is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9659)|
| 2:41:05| So, again, we don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9665)|
| 2:41:08| That's left up afterwards when your design crew goes out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9668)|
| 2:41:12| and takes a look at what they decide that they're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9672)|
| 2:41:16| Now, right now this is rezoning, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9676)|
| 2:41:20| That's correct, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9680)|
| 2:41:21| And we don't know what the end product's going to look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9681)|
| 2:41:25| You haven't seen that yet, have you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9685)|
| 2:41:27| I have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9687)|
| 2:41:28| I haven't even seen the preliminary plan that Mr. Forrester indicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9688)|
| 2:41:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9691)|
| 2:41:32| So you haven't even seen those preliminary plans to do the design?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9692)|
| 2:41:35| I have not, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9695)|
| 2:41:36| So we're not at that stage right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9696)|
| 2:41:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9698)|
| 2:41:39| I just thought I'd throw that out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9699)|
| 2:41:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9700)|
| 2:41:42| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9702)|
| 2:41:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9705)|
| 2:41:48| Mr. Commissioner Daley, you are recommending what's actually presented here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9708)|
| 2:41:55| and I hear Mr. Forrester, you're asking two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9715)|
| 2:41:59| and Mr. Forrester's asking for three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9719)|
| 2:42:01| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9721)|
| 2:42:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9722)|
| 2:42:04| Forgive what I don't know, and I'm probably going to show it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9724)|
| 2:42:07| but kind of getting back to what Commissioner Schoonmaker was talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9727)|
| 2:42:12| if we're looking at basically ten of these acres that you think is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9732)|
| 2:42:18| able to be developed on this ten acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9738)|
| 2:42:24| what's the difference if it's two per acre as opposed to three per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9744)|
| 2:42:29| if it's still disturbing the same amount of land?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9749)|
| 2:42:33| Is that appreciably different in the building process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9753)|
| 2:42:41| I'm asking Mr. Stone or whoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9761)|
| 2:42:45| May I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9765)|
| 2:42:47| Please, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9767)|
| 2:42:49| Sixty home sites would be, let's just say 60 homes on, wouldn't take ten acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9769)|
| 2:42:56| Or if it was 60 homes on ten acres, they would be bigger lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9776)|
| 2:43:01| And if you had 60 homes, you may not need the ten acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9781)|
| 2:43:05| You may only need to use five or four of the acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9785)|
| 2:43:08| If you go three per home, you're going to use the 90 number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9788)|
| 2:43:12| The more use of the land, you're going to use more of that ten acres of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9792)|
| 2:43:18| You're disturbing more of that land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9798)|
| 2:43:20| There's a good chance that when you do that, you're disturbing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9800)|
| 2:43:26| I'm going to use the word Mother Nature, how Mother Nature intended the flow of the land to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9806)|
| 2:43:32| So, yes, I see a difference in it, but I'm only one person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9812)|
| 2:43:36| There is a difference between 60 and 90.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9816)|
| 2:43:40| And if I may, I mean, I do get that part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9820)|
| 2:43:46| I guess I'm, is the developer here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9826)|
| 2:43:51| I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9831)|
| 2:43:54| He's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9834)|
| 2:43:55| He's out of state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9835)|
| 2:43:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9836)|
| 2:43:59| If, in fact, and I get what you're talking about with density and all, Commissioner Daly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9839)|
| 2:44:05| but if it's determined that there's actually ten buildable acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9845)|
| 2:44:17| I guess I would think that the developer would make every effort to use all of that ten acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9857)|
| 2:44:28| Is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9868)|
| 2:44:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9869)|
| 2:44:30| And if they're going to use, if there's ten good acres here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9870)|
| 2:44:34| and the developer comes in and says, okay, these ten acres are good to build on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9874)|
| 2:44:39| then my question is, I understand the density piece,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9879)|
| 2:44:44| but you're not disturbing any more or less land if you have two versus three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9884)|
| 2:44:53| if you're staying within this ten acre block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9893)|
| 2:44:57| Is my thinking messed up there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9897)|
| 2:45:00| Commissioner Schoonmaker would like to respond to that since he brought up the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9900)|
| 2:45:03| You're on track, except that on those ten acres, would you prefer, like the MPC said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9903)|
| 2:45:08| to have 60 homes on ten acres of ground,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9908)|
| 2:45:12| or do you want 90 homes on the same ten acres of ground as the applicant has requested?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9912)|
| 2:45:20| Still going to disturb ten acres, but do you want 60 homes on together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9920)|
| 2:45:26| which that would be about 16 dwelling units an acre, I guess, 60 homes on ten acres?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9926)|
| 2:45:31| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9931)|
| 2:45:32| And I understand that part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9932)|
| 2:45:33| I understand the density part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9933)|
| 2:45:36| It's just I'm hearing so much of the opposition being about the sinkholes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9936)|
| 2:45:41| and the topography and that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9941)|
| 2:45:44| That's really what I was at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9944)|
| 2:45:46| Commissioner Ward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9946)|
| 2:45:47| Commissioner Hill, are you talking about, like, the economics of why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9947)|
| 2:45:50| Is that what you're trying to get at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9950)|
| 2:45:51| I'm just trying to understand your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9951)|
| 2:45:53| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9953)|
| 2:45:54| Are you trying to ask of the economics of why for the ten acres for the density?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9954)|
| 2:45:58| No, I'm talking about actual land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9958)|
| 2:46:00| Oh, the land usage, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9960)|
| 2:46:03| Commissioner Smith, and then I'm going to weigh in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9963)|
| 2:46:06| and then come back to Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9966)|
| 2:46:08| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9968)|
| 2:46:10| We are in the zoning process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9970)|
| 2:46:12| and I think once discussed the concept used on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9972)|
| 2:46:18| when the engineers dive down into it, when MPC dives down into it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9978)|
| 2:46:23| we'll know more about what is yieldable and what is feasible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9983)|
| 2:46:28| The developer has asked for three units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9988)|
| 2:46:31| and with all due respect to Mr. Daly, I'm going to make a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9991)|
| 2:46:35| If it fails, we can come back to what Mr. Daly has offered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9995)|
| 2:46:39| But I would make a substitute motion for three units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=9999)|
| 2:46:42| There's a substitute motion by Commissioner Smith for three units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10002)|
| 2:46:45| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10005)|
| 2:46:47| Second by Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10007)|
| 2:46:50| Okay, we'll continue the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10010)|
| 2:46:52| I had a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10012)|
| 2:46:56| Was there any, this may be historical knowledge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10016)|
| 2:47:00| I'm not sure when the existing neighborhood was built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10020)|
| 2:47:03| the one that I drove through there on, sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10023)|
| 2:47:09| what was the name of the feeder road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10029)|
| 2:47:11| Oh, Gondola.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10031)|
| 2:47:13| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10033)|
| 2:47:14| It's not Gondola.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10034)|
| 2:47:17| Gondola?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10037)|
| 2:47:19| Yeah, Gondola.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10039)|
| 2:47:20| Gondola, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10040)|
| 2:47:21| That neighborhood that is in there now, is there any,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10041)|
| 2:47:24| do you know of any discussion about sinkholes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10044)|
| 2:47:26| I mean, it's right next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10046)|
| 2:47:27| It's obviously less density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10047)|
| 2:47:29| but it's still a huge neighborhood right there in that same area on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10049)|
| 2:47:32| same ridgeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10052)|
| 2:47:33| And it's pretty hilly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10053)|
| 2:47:34| Do you know of any issues with drainage or sinkholes in that area that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10054)|
| 2:47:39| aware of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10059)|
| 2:47:40| I'm not aware of any, but that precedes my time here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10060)|
| 2:47:44| I think that one of the things that planned development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10064)|
| 2:47:48| I just want to remind everybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10068)|
| 2:47:49| one of the things that planned residential does is it kind of gives that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10069)|
| 2:47:52| extra step of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10072)|
| 2:47:53| And instead of just saying, here's the zoning, go for it, good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10073)|
| 2:47:58| It has to come back and it has to go through a much more rigorous process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10078)|
| 2:48:02| And they may say, you can only do a unit an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10082)|
| 2:48:05| That they may say, hey, you can do three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10085)|
| 2:48:07| You know, I think that that's a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10087)|
| 2:48:10| I think that we've asked time and again for those kinds of steps to give a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10090)|
| 2:48:13| little buffer to making an absolute decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10093)|
| 2:48:16| And, and,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10096)|
| 2:48:18| and one of the concerns I have is if we, if we dial, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10098)|
| 2:48:24| there's three dials in, in housing, inventory, price,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10104)|
| 2:48:28| and what's in development that is going to be soon to be inventory and land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10108)|
| 2:48:32| use goes in there somewhere too. And as we, if we approve stuff for less density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10112)|
| 2:48:37| then the prices of those houses are going to rise and you're not going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10117)|
| 2:48:41| have affordable housing for people that need those starter homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10121)|
| 2:48:44| And so this is one of those sort of great balancing acts of what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10124)|
| 2:48:48| what could you do? Should you, can you do? And I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10128)|
| 2:48:52| I think there's a lot to be figured out in the planned residential process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10132)|
| 2:48:55| And I think that's a good thing. So I just had a couple of questions about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10135)|
| 2:48:59| Other lights, commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10139)|
| 2:49:04| Nothing gets to you, Mr. Chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10144)|
| 2:49:06| but I'm tired of hearing South Knoxville being a starter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10146)|
| 2:49:09| We are, we are not starters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10149)|
| 2:49:12| We in South Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10152)|
| 2:49:17| we in South Knoxville deserve better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10157)|
| 2:49:21| And just because we're South Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10161)|
| 2:49:24| doesn't mean that we're low income or low this, and it's not against you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10164)|
| 2:49:30| This is, this is the perception that we see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10170)|
| 2:49:34| that we hear about South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10174)|
| 2:49:39| And I love my South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10179)|
| 2:49:42| I'll fight for tooth and toenail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10182)|
| 2:49:44| I can promise you that three per acre is way too many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10184)|
| 2:49:49| And I hope you vote no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10189)|
| 2:49:52| To clarify commissioner Daly, it was not a slate against South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10192)|
| 2:49:55| I was simply looking at what was provided to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10195)|
| 2:49:57| which are seem to be condos and what would be generally considered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10197)|
| 2:50:02| you know, starter homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10202)|
| 2:50:04| And that would be for anywhere in Knox County, not just in the South side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10204)|
| 2:50:08| Any other comments or questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10208)|
| 2:50:10| We have a substitute motion on the floor by commissioner Smith for three units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10210)|
| 2:50:14| an acre and a second by commissioner Biggs, all in favor, please say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10214)|

| 2:51:29| I'd like to ask the developer, the developer's representative, typically before we give somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10289)|
| 2:51:36| a zoning, a density they don't want, we ask them if they're willing to accept it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10296)|
| 2:51:48| Again not having my client here and being able to, he's been out of pocket recently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10308)|
| 2:51:54| and I guess could I request a postponement at this time and come back with the understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10314)|
| 2:52:02| of there being a motion and a second for a vote of two dwelling units per acre, not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10322)|
| 2:52:07| to come back and argue the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10327)|
| 2:52:08| I'm sorry, I couldn't hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10328)|

| 2:52:12| So you were unable to speak to your client beforehand about scenarios that could possibly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10332)|
| 2:52:18| happen to find out if he'd be okay if we passed exactly what MPC did?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10338)|
| 2:52:24| I mean I guess yes, I mean we can proceed with the vote of two dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10344)|
| 2:52:29| Okay thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10349)|

| 2:52:36| Yes, so a yes vote is two units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10356)|
| 2:52:39| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10359)|

| 2:53:40| Sure, Planning Commission recommends that County Commission deny C.A. General Business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10420)|
| 2:53:44| zoning because it is not consistent with the Northeast County Sector Plan designation and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10424)|
| 2:53:48| could cause adverse impacts for neighboring residential properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10428)|
| 2:53:54| It's hard to hear, but I'll just reiterate that you stated exactly what is on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10434)|
| 2:53:58| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10438)|
| 2:53:59| I know it's difficult at times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10439)|
| 2:54:02| Okay, if you would please state your name and address for the recognition of the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10442)|

| 2:54:11| I have Mr. Travis Walker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10451)|
| 2:54:13| Do your best to speak into the mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10453)|
| 2:54:15| I'm sorry, I'm not speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10455)|
| 2:54:17| Just do your best, just yell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10457)|

| 2:54:21| Ben Mullins, 550 West Main Street, here for the applicant and beside me is Mr. Travis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10461)|
| 2:54:26| Walker who resides at the property at 7508 Idle Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10466)|
| 2:54:32| I hope that Commission has had a chance to review the submission that I sent on October| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10472)|
| 2:54:38| 22nd, 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10478)|
| 2:54:41| I outlined our position pretty thoroughly in that letter in hopes to maybe direct this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10481)|
| 2:54:47| conversation a little bit more specifically to some of the issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10487)|
| 2:54:54| Mr. Walker, and he can probably tell his story a lot better than I can, this is his residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10494)|
| 2:55:00| He resides there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10500)|
| 2:55:02| He is a diesel mechanic by trade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10502)|
| 2:55:04| When he sought to obtain a building permit and a variance for this garage, it wasn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10504)|
| 2:55:09| his intent to develop some business there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10509)|
| 2:55:12| He was working on his own vehicles there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10512)|
| 2:55:16| He's a good mechanic and as often happens, especially in rural areas, you go to people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10516)|
| 2:55:23| you know for work and he began to get more and more work and began to charge from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10523)|
| 2:55:28| He did not realize he was violating his own ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10528)|
| 2:55:31| He was just doing his job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10531)|
| 2:55:34| He was working at nights at Kenworth and days working on his own vehicles and other people's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10534)|
| 2:55:39| vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10539)|
| 2:55:40| Well, that business began to grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10540)|
| 2:55:41| He began to hire people to work for him and to the point where he was able to quit his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10541)|
| 2:55:48| job at Kenworth and do this full time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10548)|
| 2:55:50| It was at that time I think there were some neighbors who were concerned really about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10550)|
| 2:55:56| some personal activity that occurred on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10556)|
| 2:55:59| We can talk more about that later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10559)|
| 2:56:00| I'm sure the neighbors will bring that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10560)|
| 2:56:02| Not related to the business specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10562)|
| 2:56:05| And codes came out and said this is not a legal use of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10565)|
| 2:56:09| You're in an agricultural zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10569)|
| 2:56:10| This is a commercial business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10570)|
| 2:56:13| You either need to shut your business down or you need to go get your rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10573)|
| 2:56:17| Well, Mr. Walker did what they told him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10577)|
| 2:56:20| He went to the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10580)|
| 2:56:21| He filed an application for the CA zoning which would allow him to continue his use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10581)|
| 2:56:27| on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10587)|
| 2:56:29| And he went to the Planning Commission and made his case, made a very good case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10589)|
| 2:56:33| I'm almost embarrassed to be hired to make the same case that he made here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10593)|
| 2:56:39| The vote, though, was ten to three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10599)|
| 2:56:42| There were three commissioners that thought this was compatible with the agricultural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10602)|
| 2:56:47| area and that this was a needed business in the area and thought that the rezoning would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10607)|
| 2:56:52| be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10612)|
| 2:56:54| There's two factors to this appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10614)|
| 2:56:56| The sector plan, which I think technically isn't on appeal, but in essence you have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10616)|
| 2:57:01| consider the sector plan and the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10621)|
| 2:57:05| The sector plan of the northeast county for this is agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10625)|
| 2:57:11| And the recommendation against amending the sector plan was that, you know, it's not compatible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10631)|
| 2:57:17| with the surrounding areas and the surrounding zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10637)|
| 2:57:20| One of the justifications, however, for amending a sector plan is that there are changes in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10640)|
| 2:57:26| the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10646)|
| 2:57:27| And this is a growing area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10647)|
| 2:57:29| We've all been here for developments like Mr. Forrester had a little bit previously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10649)|
| 2:57:33| where there's a demand for housing in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10653)|
| 2:57:36| And when there's a demand for housing in the areas, there's a demand for services such| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10656)|
| 2:57:41| as automobile repair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10661)|
| 2:57:43| And that's what's happening here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10663)|
| 2:57:44| He is meeting a demand that is organic to his residential neighborhood, to where he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10664)|
| 2:57:49| lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10669)|
| 2:57:50| And I don't think that was properly considered, the growing nature of the northeast county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10670)|
| 2:57:56| and the fact that there is a dearth of commercial zones in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10676)|
| 2:58:02| There's not a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10682)|
| 2:58:03| You could look, you know, I gave you a zoning map of the area, and you could see pockets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10683)|
| 2:58:10| of zones of commercial that are in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10690)|
| 2:58:15| Mr. Walker tells me as a resident there's many more commercial activities that may not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10695)|
| 2:58:20| show up there with commercial zones for people like him that are doing businesses that maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10700)|
| 2:58:25| don't have the zoning because that's really how things grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10705)|
| 2:58:29| It's not, we would like to thank as planners and attorneys and commissioners that it's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10709)|
| 2:58:34| you lay down a plan and things follow that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10714)|
| 2:58:37| It doesn't always.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10717)|
| 2:58:39| There's a market that drives what businesses are in place, and that's what has occurred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10719)|
| 2:58:43| here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10723)|
| 2:58:45| Now, Mr. Walker's done very well, and he's been very frank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10725)|
| 2:58:50| He was frank with the planning commission, and I outlined this in the letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10730)|
| 2:58:54| He's going to have to move from this spot regardless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10734)|
| 2:58:58| He has done well enough where he's going to have to find a new location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10738)|
| 2:59:02| He would like to find a location in the area, but again, one of the challenges is there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10742)|
| 2:59:05| not a lot of commercial activity to serve this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10745)|
| 2:59:09| So what we're really asking for, I mean, is to allow him to continue his business for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10749)|
| 2:59:16| a couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10756)|
| 2:59:17| He's 26 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10757)|
| 2:59:18| It's his first business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10758)|

| 2:59:23| He doesn't have a long history of commercial tax returns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10763)|
| 2:59:26| It's difficult for him to obtain financing to go buy property that's already zoned commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10766)|
| 2:59:30| and then develop it into this business, but he's searching for that, and he needs time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10770)|
| 2:59:35| And if we want to do this as a commercial zone for a couple of years and then change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10775)|
| 2:59:40| it back, I think this commission has that within its authority to do so, but we're asking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10780)|
| 2:59:45| for some consideration to allow him to continue his business, to continue the service he's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10785)|
| 2:59:51| providing to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10791)|
| 2:59:53| We've outlined a lot of the benefits that he's providing to the community as a local| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10793)|
| 2:59:58| business owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10798)|
| 2:59:59| You know, just like being in South Knoxville, Commissioner Daley, he's in the Corrington| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10799)|
| 3:00:04| area, and he loves the area, and he wants to give back to the area, and he's trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10804)|
| 3:00:07| to do so through this business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10807)|
| 3:00:09| So we would ask that this commission respectfully overrule the recommendation of the Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10809)|
| 3:00:15| Commission, look at it the way the three commissioners that voted in favor of the zoning did, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10815)|
| 3:00:22| grant him his rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10822)|
| 3:00:23| And I would love to hear what the neighbors will say, and I would love to have an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10823)|
| 3:00:28| to address that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10828)|
| 3:00:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10829)|
| 3:00:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10830)|
| 3:00:31| I'd like to welcome the opposition to come and speak first, or come speak next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10831)|

| 3:00:40| If you would please state your name and address for the record, and somebody representing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10840)|
| 3:00:46| the whole group, or are you all individually wanting to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10846)|
| 3:00:49| Just so I can...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10849)|
| 3:00:50| Great neighbors, speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10850)|
| 3:00:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10851)|
| 3:00:53| I'm trying...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10853)|
| 3:00:54| I gave them about five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10854)|
| 3:00:55| I didn't really time it, so if you guys could sort of break it up and do that as well, I'd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10855)|
| 3:00:58| appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10858)|
| 3:00:59| Just state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10859)|
| 3:01:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10860)|
| 3:01:01| My name's Norman Trivett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10861)|
| 3:01:02| I live at 7505 Idle Lane in Cortland, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10862)|
| 3:01:07| First of all, I have no grudges against Travis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10867)|
| 3:01:12| I've lived out there 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10872)|
| 3:01:14| It was a nice, quiet neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10874)|
| 3:01:16| Travis moved in out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10876)|
| 3:01:18| He's been to my place and helped me put hay out of the field, into the barn, and I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10878)|
| 3:01:23| been to his place and helped him on his house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10883)|
| 3:01:27| The only drawback is that he's built a tremendous building there, which is not compliant with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10887)|
| 3:01:34| the rest of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10894)|
| 3:01:36| When he went to get a building permit, according to, let's see the guy's name here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10896)|
| 3:01:44| You can speak into the mic a little bit more, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10904)|
| 3:01:46| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10906)|
| 3:01:47| Anyway, at the planning commission, he got a building permit, and it was for a small| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10907)|
| 3:01:52| garage, and they asked him if it was going to be for commercial use, and he said no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10912)|
| 3:01:58| But the building has turned out to be a five-car metal building, 60 feet by 40 feet, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10918)|
| 3:02:07| takes up a whole lot of room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10927)|
| 3:02:10| In the letter from the attorney, he states that he's going to do $700,000 in business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10930)|
| 3:02:17| this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10937)|
| 3:02:19| That generates a lot of traffic up and down this small, narrow road in a residential neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10939)|
| 3:02:26| He also states that he pays hot rods towing $400 to $600 a week for towing, and that generates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10946)|
| 3:02:35| a lot of business, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10955)|
| 3:02:37| I live right across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10957)|
| 3:02:38| I see what comes in and what goes out, and it's just a whole lot of traffic that we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10958)|
| 3:02:45| need out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10965)|
| 3:02:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10966)|
| 3:02:47| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10967)|
| 3:02:48| Next speaker, if you could, please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10968)|
| 3:02:53| My name is Charles Harrell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10973)|
| 3:02:54| I own the property right behind Travis's at 7528 Idle Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10974)|
| 3:03:01| And I guess when the problem started, we just started seeing all kinds of vehicles originally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10981)|
| 3:03:06| all around the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10986)|
| 3:03:07| I mean, there'd be seven, ten vehicles he was working on in an old garage, and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10987)|
| 3:03:13| all of a sudden, they built this huge building, and then it jumped to the times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10993)|
| 3:03:18| We'd see 23, counting them personally, 23 to 27 vehicles, was all around the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=10998)|
| 3:03:24| in the building, all in the yards, and on the side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11004)|
| 3:03:28| And then after that, there was what I call the stockade that you've seen pictures of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11008)|
| 3:03:32| probably from the earlier, was right in front of my mother's house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11012)|
| 3:03:36| Well, that's a problem of me trying to sell my house because the first prospect that showed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11016)|
| 3:03:43| up says, what in the world is this fence, and what is that huge building, and what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11023)|
| 3:03:48| all this traffic on this dead-end road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11028)|
| 3:03:51| And so we explained to them what had happened, and somewhere along the way there, I talked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11031)|
| 3:03:56| to Travis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11036)|
| 3:03:57| I said, what's all these vehicles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11037)|
| 3:03:59| He said, well, it's a codes problem, and I'm trying to work it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11039)|
| 3:04:02| I'm hiring more people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11042)|
| 3:04:03| Well, I didn't know it was illegal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11043)|
| 3:04:06| You know, he's just a friend doing business, and I think he just got in over his head before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11046)|
| 3:04:11| he realized, you know, I'm doing it illegal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11051)|
| 3:04:15| And one of the people that I know told him, said, you know, you're going to get caught.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11055)|
| 3:04:19| He said, well, I don't think anybody will care or tell, but we do care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11059)|
| 3:04:25| And it is a problem for us, and when I'm trying to sell it, I've got issues right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11065)|
| 3:04:31| how well that's going to work out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11071)|
| 3:04:33| You know, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11073)|
| 3:04:34| I'm still working on it, and I still consider Travis a friend, and I just think he got in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11074)|
| 3:04:41| too far, and it's hurting all of our property values with what all is going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11081)|
| 3:04:47| And I do wish him well, and I hope he finds a place, but it's not helping us with what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11087)|
| 3:04:52| all is going on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11092)|
| 3:04:54| We've really got issues that we have to deal with in the traffic and how it's hurt our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11094)|
| 3:04:58| property values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11098)|
| 3:05:00| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11100)|
| 3:05:01| And last gentleman, if you would, please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11101)|
| 3:05:04| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11104)|
| 3:05:05| My name is John Daniel Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11105)|
| 3:05:07| I live at 7517 Idle Lane, Corrington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11107)|
| 3:05:12| I agree 100% with what my neighbors just said, and I'll try not to be redundant because I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11112)|
| 3:05:18| know there are some time constraints, but there's a couple of things I want to quickly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11118)|
| 3:05:22| point out and discuss that I think are relevant, and I believe they could very well have an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11122)|
| 3:05:28| impact on your decision here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11128)|
| 3:05:31| I hope you did read the letter from his attorney, because I've read it and reread it, and one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11131)|
| 3:05:36| common thread seems to be that there's this opinion that Travis built this garage and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11136)|
| 3:05:43| he intended to use it for his own private vehicles and his own private use, and it just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11143)|
| 3:05:46| kind of grew and grew, and people started bringing their vehicles to him, and it got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11146)|
| 3:05:49| bigger and bigger to what it is today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11149)|
| 3:05:54| And that sounds good, but I'm going to tell you that's not what happened, because even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11154)|
| 3:05:58| in the letter from his attorney, it says in the fall of 2018, he obtained a building permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11158)|
| 3:06:03| for a variance in a large attached garage, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11163)|
| 3:06:07| That's in the fall of 2018, and also, too, it should be pointed out that Travis had a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11167)|
| 3:06:14| business license for his company, his garage, Powerhouse Diesel, months before that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11174)|
| 3:06:21| His Better Business Bureau file, it was opened on July the 23rd, 2018, for Powerhouse Diesel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11181)|
| 3:06:28| months before he completed his garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11188)|
| 3:06:33| Now, a quick look at his garage, and I know you all have seen the pictures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11193)|
| 3:06:38| You can clearly indicate that that garage was not built just for, just as a structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11198)|
| 3:06:44| to work on your personal vehicles and to house your tractor, as was originally stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11204)|
| 3:06:52| Second thing, there seems to be this theme, and I'm going to quote from his attorney's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11212)|
| 3:06:56| letter that diesel repair is compatible and complementary to the surrounding agricultural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11216)|
| 3:07:02| uses as this is necessary for the maintenance of farm equipment, end quote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11222)|
| 3:07:07| And that sounds really good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11227)|
| 3:07:08| It sounds like Travis is working on the local farmer's farm equipment and their implements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11228)|
| 3:07:14| and whatnot, but I'm going to tell you that's not what's happening at Powerhouse Diesel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11234)|
| 3:07:19| What this garage is and has become is, and I don't really even know what to call it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11239)|
| 3:07:25| but it's mostly a high-end diesel truck performance shop for modifying and equipping large diesel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11245)|

| 3:07:35| And I hope you all have seen the video of one of these vehicles, one of these high-end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11255)|
| 3:07:41| performance trucks laying down rubber on quiet little idle lane, and that was a year and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11261)|
| 3:07:47| a half ago almost, and that black rubber can still be seen on the road today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11267)|
| 3:07:52| And so that's what we, the people of quiet little one-lane idle lane, are having to put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11272)|
| 3:07:58| up with, all the noise and the smoke and just the congestion from all these vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11278)|
| 3:08:06| And if anyone doubts what I'm saying is true, a quick look at the website for Powerhouse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11286)|
| 3:08:10| Diesel and his Facebook page will quickly confirm what I'm telling you is the absolute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11290)|
| 3:08:15| truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11295)|
| 3:08:16| And there's no mention whatsoever of Powerhouse Diesel being a place that works on farm equipment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11296)|
| 3:08:26| or the local community there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11306)|
| 3:08:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11307)|
| 3:08:28| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11308)|
| 3:08:30| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11310)|
| 3:08:31| Would the applicant like to offer any rebuttal to what they've heard from the opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11311)|
| 3:08:36| Yes, thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11316)|
| 3:08:39| Mr. Walker tells me he's working on two tractors right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11319)|
| 3:08:43| Powerhouse Diesel started off, the company started off selling online products.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11323)|
| 3:08:49| There is a performance diesel component to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11329)|
| 3:08:53| His business license was for selling property on, parts online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11333)|
| 3:09:00| The garage that he built was code compliant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11340)|
| 3:09:03| I think he did have to get one variant, it's a four-bay garage, but Mr. Walker does own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11343)|
| 3:09:09| several diesel vehicles himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11349)|
| 3:09:13| He does go to races himself, and that is an element of his company, but that's not the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11353)|
| 3:09:21| only element of his company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11361)|
| 3:09:25| So when he built his garage, it was built legally compliant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11365)|
| 3:09:30| They may say it's too large, but it's not larger than many agricultural buildings you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11370)|
| 3:09:36| see in rural East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11376)|
| 3:09:41| So we would take issue with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11381)|
| 3:09:44| Now, there was one, and Mr. Walker can tell you the circumstances behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11384)|
| 3:09:50| He did, there was a video of him burning, doing a burnout on his own vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11390)|
| 3:09:57| That was on the Facebook page a year and a half ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11397)|
| 3:10:00| That was his own vehicle, that wasn't one of his customers, and that was in honor of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11400)|
| 3:10:05| his late uncle who had passed away, who helped teach him the business of being a diesel mechanic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11405)|
| 3:10:14| So that wasn't related to the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11414)|
| 3:10:16| I can understand why they would bring that up, because it is there at their residence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11416)|
| 3:10:22| and Mr. Walker knows he shouldn't have done that, and it was a one-time thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11422)|
| 3:10:26| But that is collateral to the issues that we're talking about here today, and so I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11426)|
| 3:10:31| hope you wouldn't be distracted by that in considering, you know, just the impact this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11431)|
| 3:10:37| business has had on the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11437)|
| 3:10:39| We have letters attached to my letter from the businesses that rely upon the work that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11439)|
| 3:10:44| he generates here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11444)|
| 3:10:45| And again, we're asking for, you know, a temporary consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11445)|
| 3:10:49| Mr. Walker is willing to make considerations as far as changing his fencing, changing access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11449)|
| 3:10:56| off of Idle Lane to East Emory Road, or, you know, he's not requiring any signs, there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11456)|
| 3:11:03| no signage aspect to this, because he doesn't need signs, because his business is all word| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11463)|
| 3:11:08| of mouth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11468)|
| 3:11:09| So until he can find a new location, we would ask that there be some consideration, there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11469)|
| 3:11:16| be a rezoning in place to allow him to continue what he's doing until he leaves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11476)|
| 3:11:22| This is not going to be a bait-and-switch zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11482)|
| 3:11:23| He lives there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11483)|
| 3:11:24| This is where he resides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11484)|
| 3:11:25| You know, if he was a vacant lot, if he bought property and then was trying to rezone it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11485)|
| 3:11:30| I would understand that argument a lot more, but this is his residence, so it's not going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11490)|
| 3:11:34| to change the character of that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11494)|
| 3:11:41| The zoning ordinance doesn't really allow for these types of repair shops in anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11501)|
| 3:11:45| but a CA, a CB, or more recently, in the neighborhood commercial zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11505)|
| 3:11:50| So there's not a lot to pick from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11510)|
| 3:11:53| We'd ask under the circumstances that you allow him to continue his business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11513)|
| 3:11:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11517)|
| 3:11:58| Commissioner Bieler, this is your district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11518)|
| 3:12:00| Would you like to chime in first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11520)|
| 3:12:02| Well, I would really like to know if any of my fellow commissioners have any questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11522)|
| 3:12:06| before I speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11526)|
| 3:12:07| I see Commissioner Daley, Schoonmaker, Bussler, Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11527)|
| 3:12:10| Okay, we'll start with Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11530)|
| 3:12:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11533)|
| 3:12:14| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11534)|
| 3:12:17| We've had this same problem in South Knox on three occasions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11537)|
| 3:12:21| Mr. Walker, when you went to buy your permit, did Coach tell you that you could not have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11541)|
| 3:12:26| a commercial business there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11546)|
| 3:12:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11548)|
| 3:12:31| And you went ahead and put a commercial business there anyway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11551)|
| 3:12:34| After it grew, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11554)|
| 3:12:35| Now, the reason why the building is so large is because one bay is a 14-foot bay for my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11555)|
| 3:12:41| motorhome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11561)|
| 3:12:42| I also have a 38-foot trailer, and I've also owned two trucks personally, along with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11562)|
| 3:12:48| side-by-side and some other stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11568)|
| 3:12:50| So regardless to whether, like, you know, if I have to move today or two years from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11570)|
| 3:12:57| now, the building is still going to be used as far as for personal use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11577)|
| 3:13:04| Not only did the codes ask you if you were going to use commercial, the day you appeared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11584)|
| 3:13:08| before BZA, the chairman asked you if you were going to use that for commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11588)|
| 3:13:13| Yeah, at the time, there was no, I had no intentions of using that as commercial at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11593)|
| 3:13:20| that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11600)|
| 3:13:21| But intentions, intentions don't mean that you can do it later on in two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11601)|
| 3:13:26| Or a year, or six months, or three months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11606)|
| 3:13:29| So zoning's zoning, and I really feel for you, I really do, but we've got to follow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11609)|
| 3:13:34| the rules, and the three businesses that happened in South Knoxville, they were closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11614)|
| 3:13:43| One of them tried to take it to court, he lost in court because up front, they were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11623)|
| 3:13:49| told that they could not have a commercial business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11629)|
| 3:13:53| If they went for a variance, same thing at BZA, they're going to ask anyone that comes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11633)|
| 3:13:57| before BZA, are you going to use this for commercial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11637)|
| 3:14:01| And thank you for being honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11641)|
| 3:14:04| A lot of people would try to weasel out of that, I'll use the word weasel, or instead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11644)|
| 3:14:09| of that white lie, and I appreciate you doing that, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11649)|
| 3:14:13| And I just want to add to it, I would have went about this sooner, but, so codes came| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11653)|
| 3:14:20| to me June, July of last year, somewhere around in there, and told me about the vehicles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11660)|
| 3:14:26| and stuff like that, and I told them what I was doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11666)|
| 3:14:31| And they told me, they said, well, as long as we can't see the vehicles, we have nothing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11671)|
| 3:14:36| to prove that you're doing business out of here, and we will not come and get a warrant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11676)|
| 3:14:43| to enter the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11683)|
| 3:14:44| I said, okay, so what do you want me to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11684)|
| 3:14:46| So they told me to put it in a fence, put it in a privacy fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11686)|
| 3:14:50| So within two weeks, I went and spent, I think, $4,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11690)|
| 3:14:55| Me and the neighbor put up a fence, a privacy fence behind the house to keep the trucks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11695)|
| 3:15:03| in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11703)|
| 3:15:04| I try and keep as many trucks in that fence and in the physical building as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11704)|
| 3:15:12| Most of the time, there is between two to four trucks out there of the night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11712)|
| 3:15:18| You know, any time we're working after six, it's all my personal stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11718)|
| 3:15:23| So that is the reason why I did not go and try to get it re-zoned commercial until this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11723)|
| 3:15:30| year, is due to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11730)|
| 3:15:33| Mr. Snow, does any of your codes people here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11733)|
| 3:15:37| No, but I'm pretty familiar with the situation, so I should be able to answer any questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11737)|
| 3:15:41| you may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11741)|
| 3:15:42| Do you think that one of your codes officers would have told him that it would be okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11742)|
| 3:15:47| to do a commercial business if they built a privacy fence?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11747)|
| 3:15:52| I wouldn't assume so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11752)|
| 3:15:54| Mr. Walker, we did go out there in, he's correct, in June of last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11754)|
| 3:16:01| The file notes that he has a permit for the garage, but the neighbors are indicating he's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11761)|
| 3:16:04| running a commercial business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11764)|
| 3:16:06| And I think we talked to him about some inoperable vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11766)|
| 3:16:10| But as far as some of my staff saying that, I would certainly hope that that wasn't the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11770)|
| 3:16:14| case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11774)|
| 3:16:15| But I don't know specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11775)|
| 3:16:16| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11776)|
| 3:16:17| No, they're not going to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11777)|
| 3:16:19| I've dealt with codes for a long time, and they're a top-notch group of people, and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11779)|

| 3:16:25| You know, they don't, I've not, in my 10-plus years or longer of dealing with codes, they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11785)|
| 3:16:32| don't bend the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11792)|
| 3:16:33| They follow what the book says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11793)|
| 3:16:34| So, I'm sorry you did this, but my vote's going to be no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11794)|
| 3:16:41| Mr. Walker, could you please state your name and address for the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11801)|
| 3:16:43| I didn't ask you that at the beginning of your...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11803)|
| 3:16:45| Yeah, it's Travis Walker, 7508 Idle Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11805)|
| 3:16:48| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11808)|
| 3:16:49| Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11809)|
| 3:16:52| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11812)|
| 3:16:54| Mr. Walker, how many times have you been cited by the Knox County Codes Administration?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11814)|
| 3:17:00| I think twice, between last year and this year, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11820)|
| 3:17:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11828)|
| 3:17:09| And then, in the pictures that we received as part of the MPC agenda package, there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11829)|
| 3:17:18| a fenced area with a whole bunch of cars around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11838)|
| 3:17:22| Is that where you're storing the cars instead of parking them in front of the building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11842)|
| 3:17:26| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11846)|
| 3:17:28| So, what I try my best to do is keep everything in the fence outside of business hours and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11848)|
| 3:17:34| then during business hours, that would be where I'm working on trucks in front of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11854)|
| 3:17:39| building or in the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11859)|
| 3:17:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11861)|
| 3:17:42| And do wreckers come to that business basically 24-7?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11862)|
| 3:17:48| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11868)|
| 3:17:50| There's never been a wrecker there past, I don't know, 8, 9 o'clock at night, something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11870)|
| 3:17:56| like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11876)|
| 3:17:57| So, and I can have anybody that has been there to testify to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11877)|
| 3:18:05| I mean, I have no reason to lie about anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11885)|
| 3:18:09| I feel like I've tried my best to do this in the best way possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11889)|
| 3:18:15| I mean, I'm still learning on how to even run a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11895)|
| 3:18:20| And I feel like I've been successful maybe too quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11900)|
| 3:18:25| And that's why it's took me this long to go through the correct path, I guess, to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11905)|
| 3:18:33| this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11913)|
| 3:18:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11914)|
| 3:18:35| And how close did you build your garage to the residential property line?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11915)|
| 3:18:44| As far as to a neighbor's property line or to the right-of-way for the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11924)|
| 3:18:50| Residential property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11930)|
| 3:18:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11931)|
| 3:18:52| We're 50 foot off of the right-of-way, so that would put it 70 to 80 feet, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11932)|
| 3:19:00| To the nearest neighbor's property line?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11940)|
| 3:19:02| Yeah, which would be across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11942)|
| 3:19:05| There's no, one gentleman testified he's behind you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11945)|
| 3:19:09| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11949)|
| 3:19:10| That's the gentleman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11950)|
| 3:19:11| This is where the building sits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11951)|
| 3:19:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11954)|
| 3:19:15| So you're not closer than 50 feet to anybody else's property line then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11955)|
| 3:19:22| As far as the actual building, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11962)|
| 3:19:23| The fence, the fenced-in area, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11963)|
| 3:19:28| That would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11968)|
| 3:19:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11969)|
| 3:19:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11970)|
| 3:19:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11971)|
| 3:19:32| Bussler, Ward, Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11972)|
| 3:19:33| Mr. Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11973)|
| 3:19:34| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11974)|
| 3:19:35| Mr. Walker, let me ask you a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11975)|
| 3:19:38| How tall is that building that you built?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11978)|
| 3:19:41| That is 16 foot walls, roughly 24, 25 foot to the peak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11981)|
| 3:19:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11987)|
| 3:19:48| And the fence that you built around the back, how tall is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11988)|
| 3:19:52| That is an 8 foot privacy fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11992)|
| 3:19:53| 8 foot tall, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11993)|
| 3:19:54| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11994)|
| 3:19:55| Mr. Snowden, would you call that a regular fence for a neighborhood, for 8 foot tall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=11995)|
| 3:20:10| Maybe a tad tall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12010)|
| 3:20:11| I mean, most neighborhood fences are 6 feet or 4 feet, but I have seen 8 foot fences in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12011)|
| 3:20:16| those areas as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12016)|
| 3:20:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12017)|
| 3:20:18| Let me ask you one other thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12018)|
| 3:20:20| When you're parking those trucks and things in that fenced-in area, is it grass or is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12020)|
| 3:20:26| it kind of muddy or what is it back there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12026)|
| 3:20:30| I have a decent amount of rock in there, but when it is rainy, there is some mud in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12030)|
| 3:20:39| yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12039)|
| 3:20:40| Now, I will say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12040)|
| 3:20:43| The reason why that fence is there is because when I went to get the building permit, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12043)|
| 3:20:50| was wanting to put the building there, but we were thinking that the neighbor's septic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12050)|
| 3:20:57| system was right there in that general vicinity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12057)|
| 3:20:59| We just never could 100% prove it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12059)|
| 3:21:03| So that is the reason why the fence is there and not against Emory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12063)|
| 3:21:11| One of the things that you're asking us to do is do a limitation on the zoning on a piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12071)|
| 3:21:16| of property, and that does not work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12076)|
| 3:21:20| You can't zone a piece of property and say you're going to only have this for like two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12080)|
| 3:21:25| years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12085)|
| 3:21:26| Is that correct, Daniel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12086)|
| 3:21:27| And the other problem we may have with it is if we zone that piece of property and you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12087)|
| 3:21:31| decide to sell it, and the next person that buys it, they don't have an obligation to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12091)|
| 3:21:37| rezone it to downsize to another one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12097)|
| 3:21:42| So the situation is, we don't have a situation really to help you out at all if we had started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12102)|
| 3:21:49| out first with really seeing what we could do to start out, you know, not a business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12109)|
| 3:21:56| but you to work on your own cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12116)|
| 3:21:58| So you got us between a rock and a hard place, which we can't, I don't think we can help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12118)|
| 3:22:03| you at all by rezoning it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12123)|
| 3:22:05| So Mr. Walker, I'm sorry, but I'm probably going to have to vote no also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12125)|
| 3:22:11| Mr. Ward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12131)|
| 3:22:12| Travis, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12132)|
| 3:22:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12133)|
| 3:22:14| Hey, Travis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12134)|
| 3:22:15| I don't know you personally, but I know you by reputation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12135)|
| 3:22:20| Everybody in the industry says that you do phenomenal work, and I want to congratulate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12140)|
| 3:22:25| you on being so successful at such a young age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12145)|
| 3:22:28| As a small business owner myself, I know how difficult it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12148)|
| 3:22:33| I had a similar story to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12153)|
| 3:22:35| I started in my house and, you know, stored my stuff in my garage and eventually rented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12155)|
| 3:22:41| the place for a little while, and then actually the place I rented was zoned recreational| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12161)|
| 3:22:46| commercial, and I went in and said if I could get a temporary use to stay there, and I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12166)|
| 3:22:52| denied a temporary use, and they gave me six months to go find a new place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12172)|
| 3:22:57| When it comes down to it, I think you probably had good intent in the beginning, and you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12177)|
| 3:23:04| blessed that you've been as successful as you have, but I don't think you can be building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12184)|
| 3:23:09| a commercial business in a residential neighborhood, especially in the beginning when they told| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12189)|
| 3:23:15| you you can't to start with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12195)|
| 3:23:18| So even though the intent might have been good, I think the end result is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12198)|
| 3:23:23| it's probably best for you to find a new home, which I know sucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12203)|
| 3:23:26| It took me a while to find a new home and get it right, and we're still building to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12206)|
| 3:23:30| this day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12210)|
| 3:23:33| So I know it's hard, and if we do make a decision, I'd like to put a note in there that we give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12213)|
| 3:23:38| you at least a couple months to find a place so that you're not out on the street and being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12218)|
| 3:23:43| shut down right away, because I know how hard it probably took you to get to the point that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12223)|
| 3:23:47| you are now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12227)|
| 3:23:48| You know, I got six months, and I would like to extend that courtesy to you to give you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12228)|
| 3:23:52| six months to find a new home, move all the equipment, move all the trucks out, all that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12232)|
| 3:23:56| kind of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12236)|
| 3:23:57| I know it's not something you can just do, you know, next week or next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12237)|
| 3:24:02| But saying that, I'm kind of leaning the way, same way all the rest of the commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12242)|
| 3:24:05| are leaning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12245)|
| 3:24:06| It's just not fair to your neighbors or the neighborhood at the end of the day, and especially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12246)|
| 3:24:11| when originally you were told you can't have the commercial business, even though I feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12251)|
| 3:24:15| for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12255)|

| 3:24:58| business started out, he was actually the one to make the logo for the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12298)|
| 3:25:06| Reason why is because he ran a sign shop out of there, and I find it coincidental that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12306)|
| 3:25:12| when he started complaining, he actually moved it about a mile and a half down the road to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12312)|
| 3:25:17| his son's house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12317)|

| 3:25:27| a believer in you pay your property tax, I pay mine, and you know, my opinion of what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12327)|
| 3:25:33| you do on your property should not matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12333)|
| 3:25:37| He also never had a problem, even as early as, I think it was February or March, when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12337)|
| 3:25:42| I worked on his truck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12342)|
| 3:25:44| I think he spent around $1,500 to $2,000 on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12344)|
| 3:25:48| Did not care a bit that I worked on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12348)|
| 3:25:52| You know, so, and his, you know, I've helped him, that wasn't the only vehicle I've helped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12352)|
| 3:25:57| him on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12357)|
| 3:25:58| I've worked him, I've helped him on his tractor a little bit, and you know, his son's Explorer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12358)|
| 3:26:04| and then maybe another vehicle of his.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12364)|
| 3:26:08| You know, my problem with that is, is how can you sit here and say that you don't agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12368)|
| 3:26:14| with me doing something when you were doing the exact same thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12374)|
| 3:26:17| Commissioner, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12377)|
| 3:26:19| Can I respond to him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12379)|
| 3:26:21| So, I went and never parked my vehicle at my house, I stored stuff in my garage, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12381)|
| 3:26:27| then I rent a building with the thought that I could be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12387)|
| 3:26:32| When I was told I couldn't be there, I immediately applied for a variance, or, not a variance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12392)|
| 3:26:38| but, and so, I don't know, what's the word I'm looking for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12398)|
| 3:26:45| Exception, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12405)|
| 3:26:46| An exception to the current zoning, and I was denied the exception, and then they were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12406)|
| 3:26:50| kind enough to give me six months to find a new place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12410)|
| 3:26:52| So, I took it on right away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12412)|
| 3:26:54| I was never told, no, you can't have a business there, from the beginning, when you asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12414)|
| 3:26:59| to build the building, you were told, no, you can't have a business there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12419)|
| 3:27:01| I was never told that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12421)|
| 3:27:02| When I went for my lease, the guy told me, this is a zoned commercial, you can be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12422)|
| 3:27:07| I was lied to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12427)|
| 3:27:08| So, they were trying to be nice to me and give me the out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12428)|
| 3:27:12| That's the difference in the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12432)|
| 3:27:14| Commissioner Biggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12434)|
| 3:27:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12436)|
| 3:27:20| Can you tell me, Director Snowden, if this doesn't pass, I was going to ask the direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12440)|
| 3:27:28| that Commissioner Ward was going, what would he, by the code standard, what was the timeline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12448)|
| 3:27:35| he's looking at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12455)|
| 3:27:38| It varies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12458)|
| 3:27:39| I mean, obviously, it sounds like Mr. Walker's got a pretty successful business, so we want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12459)|
| 3:27:43| to be conscious of that and work with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12463)|
| 3:27:46| We'd certainly take input from this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12466)|
| 3:27:49| Typically, we give 30 days, but that's kind of general, but as long as someone's making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12469)|
| 3:27:54| active progress to get in compliance, we'll try to work with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12474)|
| 3:27:59| So, I would think a couple of months would be reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12479)|
| 3:28:03| Were the cars that were just kind of sitting there on mobile, were they taken care of and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12483)|
| 3:28:09| the codes complaints taken care of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12489)|
| 3:28:10| They were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12490)|
| 3:28:11| We were able to close that file, and the only open file we have is a home occupation, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12491)|
| 3:28:16| resulted in this particular case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12496)|
| 3:28:18| Do we have any complaints on the sign shop he was talking about a mile and a half down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12498)|
| 3:28:21| the road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12501)|
| 3:28:22| Not that I'm aware of, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12502)|
| 3:28:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12504)|
| 3:28:25| Do you have that address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12505)|
| 3:28:26| I can Google Map it real quick if you want, but I don't have it specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12506)|
| 3:28:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12512)|
| 3:28:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12513)|
| 3:28:34| Mr. Walker, I just have a couple of quick questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12514)|
| 3:28:38| I'm not seeing other lights on before I turn it back over to your Commissioner, District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12518)|
| 3:28:42| Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12522)|
| 3:28:44| I drove out to your property yesterday, drove around a little bit, and it's interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12524)|
| 3:28:50| If you sort of look at a snapshot between here and here, you know, standing at the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12530)|
| 3:28:56| minus your building, and you can, if you do a Google search on this property right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12536)|
| 3:29:01| the building doesn't exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12541)|
| 3:29:02| The Google Map is, you know, far before you built it, and it is a small little residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12542)|
| 3:29:07| neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12547)|
| 3:29:08| At the same time, two fields over, there's a two or three acre substation that is massive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12548)|
| 3:29:15| So it's not so, you know, pristine and rural as, you know, because there is other stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12555)|
| 3:29:21| and there's obviously a growing community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12561)|
| 3:29:24| I did notice a ton of trucks out front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12564)|
| 3:29:28| It's a Sunday, I imagine, just like every entrepreneur, you're working 24-7, and that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12568)|
| 3:29:33| part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12573)|
| 3:29:35| I, from a perspective of your neighbors, what's amazing is everyone I got an email from and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12575)|
| 3:29:43| I talked to a few, they all said the same thing, man, Travis is a good kid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12583)|
| 3:29:47| He works his butt off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12587)|
| 3:29:49| This is just a really unfortunate position that we're all kind of stuck in because, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12589)|
| 3:29:54| know, going back to the MPC recordings and things, it was a barn for tractors and agricultural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12594)|
| 3:30:01| stuff and it grew and grew and grew and you're in a tough spot right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12601)|
| 3:30:07| We need mechanics and we need people like you, but we also need to make sure we respect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12607)|
| 3:30:11| our neighbors and if you look at what that field used to look like versus what it looks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12611)|
| 3:30:16| like now, it is, to me, a huge eyesore every time I were to drive in my house and see a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12616)|
| 3:30:24| pile of trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12624)|
| 3:30:25| And so this is a really hard balancing act, but I think you're, I want to ask the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12625)|
| 3:30:30| director on this one, the law department, is there a mechanism for approving a certain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12630)|
| 3:30:40| timeline to be able to, you know, to move a business because you can't do that overnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12640)|
| 3:30:47| We're heading into the holiday season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12647)|
| 3:30:49| It's going to be tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12649)|
| 3:30:50| Is there a mechanism for us to rule in a way that does give somebody time to correct the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12650)|
| 3:30:54| problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12654)|
| 3:30:55| And my second question is, is there a concession that if that were to be extended even longer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12655)|
| 3:31:02| that the applicant may agree to take the building down completely and turn it back into, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12662)|
| 3:31:07| know, a quiet neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12667)|
| 3:31:10| Is there any mechanism for any compromise in that department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12670)|
| 3:31:14| I don't think there's a mechanism for this body to take that action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12674)|
| 3:31:20| I think I would agree with Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12680)|
| 3:31:23| I would agree with Mr. Snowden that the executive branch and codes administration is always| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12683)|
| 3:31:29| good at working with property owners and the neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12689)|
| 3:31:34| And it's really an act of enforcing or executing laws that are already created by this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12694)|
| 3:31:42| So if this is not a, there's not a way that this body could say, you know, Mr. Snowden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12702)|
| 3:31:47| give him $120,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12707)|
| 3:31:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12708)|
| 3:31:49| So this is just truly, are we voting to uphold the planning denial in an affirmative way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12709)|
| 3:31:58| or are we not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12718)|
| 3:32:00| There's no, there's no provisionals we can put on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12720)|
| 3:32:03| So this is, this is one of those rezoning requests that comes in tandem with a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12723)|
| 3:32:09| plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12729)|
| 3:32:10| They did not approve the second plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12730)|
| 3:32:11| So you don't have authority to adopt a zoning amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12731)|
| 3:32:17| So there are two options for you tonight, either send the sector plan amendment back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12737)|
| 3:32:22| to a planning commission or deny the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12742)|
| 3:32:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12746)|
| 3:32:27| So there's two options tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12747)|
| 3:32:29| And if it was sent back, well, they're, they're saying deny it, they're recommending deny| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12749)|
| 3:32:35| it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12755)|
| 3:32:36| So this is, you got to go back into this affirmative and what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12756)|
| 3:32:39| So if you send it back to planning commission, planning commission will reconsider it and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12759)|
| 3:32:45| send the, another recommendation back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12765)|
| 3:32:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12768)|
| 3:32:49| So it just ping pongs it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12769)|
| 3:32:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12770)|
| 3:32:51| That goes back and forth for a couple of months and, and it would be back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12771)|
| 3:32:54| But if, if the motion is to deny the rezoning appeal, then a vote in favor of that motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12774)|
| 3:33:04| would be to deny the request and that would end all of the applications and everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12784)|
| 3:33:10| tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12790)|
| 3:33:11| And then what would happen to his business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12791)|
| 3:33:13| Would zone, would codes then say you have a certain amount of time and do they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12793)|
| 3:33:17| discretion on how much time to give?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12797)|
| 3:33:19| Yes, there is a certain amount of prosecutorial type discretion involved in enforcing the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12799)|
| 3:33:24| zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12804)|
| 3:33:25| I think I'm going to be in the same spot as many as my colleagues, however, I do want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12805)|
| 3:33:30| to say this and just make an appeal to Mr. Snowden and our team in the codes department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12810)|
| 3:33:35| Yeah, you, you, you messed up and you did wrong and here we are and it's, we are where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12815)|
| 3:33:41| we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12821)|
| 3:33:42| But you have a thriving business and we have said time and again on this body, we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12822)|
| 3:33:46| more tree people in the trades and we need more people in helping our farm farmers and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12826)|
| 3:33:51| our rural communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12831)|
| 3:33:54| And I would just implore the engineering team and our codes department to, to do your best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12834)|
| 3:34:00| to give enough leeway for you to, to find a way to keep your business going in a, in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12840)|
| 3:34:03| a prosperous way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12843)|
| 3:34:05| Commissioner Hill and then Commissioner Beeler will finish this up tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12845)|
| 3:34:15| Mr. Stone, when, when COATS comes out, do they enter, enter facilities or do they just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12855)|
| 3:34:22| look at the, what's going on outside?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12862)|
| 3:34:27| Typically we just look, look around outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12867)|
| 3:34:30| I mean, if, if we're invited in, you know, depending on the circumstance and by, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12870)|
| 3:34:35| a request for violation, we can, but typically it's a, just a, you know, a external, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12875)|
| 3:34:40| know, view from that perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12880)|
| 3:34:42| So if everything looks okay outside, then that's pretty much good for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12882)|
| 3:34:48| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12888)|
| 3:34:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12889)|
| 3:34:50| Did you hear that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12890)|
| 3:34:51| Mr. Travis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12891)|
| 3:34:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12892)|
| 3:34:53| Mr. Beeler, if you would, Commissioner Lundy, I'll yell to Commissioner Lundy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12893)|
| 3:34:59| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12899)|
| 3:35:00| Commissioner Lundy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12900)|
| 3:35:01| I just want to say congratulations on your business and I hate that you're in this difficult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12901)|
| 3:35:08| spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12908)|
| 3:35:09| I agree with Commissioner Jay that it is hard to find a good mechanic, but I am voting no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12909)|
| 3:35:18| but I do want to encourage the COATS to give you some kind of extension so you can move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12918)|
| 3:35:24| and whatever your next space will be, it will be better and bigger for you and you will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12924)|
| 3:35:29| have a successful business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12929)|
| 3:35:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12932)|
| 3:35:33| Thank you, Commissioner Lundy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12933)|
| 3:35:34| Commissioner Beeler, you will finish us off this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12934)|
| 3:35:36| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12936)|
| 3:35:37| I think we're seeing the great conundrum that is zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12937)|
| 3:35:42| You know, I think it's pretty apparent that the almost unanimous opinion of this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12942)|
| 3:35:47| is, man, we hate this because, you know, I'll go back to what Mr. Harrell said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12947)|
| 3:35:55| Mr. Harrell is actually the only person in this that I haven't spoken with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12955)|
| 3:35:58| I've spoken with Travis several times since last spring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12958)|
| 3:36:00| I've spoken with Mr. Jones and Mr. Trivett, but something Mr. Harrell said was that he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12960)|
| 3:36:06| still considers Travis a friend and just from my research, there's a lot of people that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12966)|
| 3:36:13| consider Travis a friend and I think it's pretty obvious that this is a young man that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12973)|
| 3:36:18| works hard, he's smart, you're a better businessman than probably you give yourself credit for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12978)|
| 3:36:24| because you're so good at your craft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12984)|
| 3:36:28| And you know, I hope there's never a zoning any closer to me than this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12988)|
| 3:36:34| You know, zoning's hard and, man, I grew up spending a lot of days and nights in Bill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12994)|
| 3:36:38| and Shirley Skeen's house, which I think is the house you live in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=12998)|
| 3:36:42| And so, I mean, this is just close to home for me and we got several emails I know from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13002)|
| 3:36:47| people in the community at large, you know, talking about the business and it was a good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13007)|
| 3:36:52| business and for us to give them consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13012)|
| 3:36:56| But in the end, this is zoning and it's really Mr. Walker and the neighbors who have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13016)|
| 3:37:02| voice in this, more so than the community at large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13022)|
| 3:37:06| And you know, again, as Commissioner Ward said, I wish you the best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13026)|
| 3:37:13| If there's any way we can help, we'll help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13033)|
| 3:37:15| And I will say to Mr. Snowden, I would ask, as the chairman did, that you give plenty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13035)|
| 3:37:21| of grace in this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13041)|
| 3:37:23| And I will say to the neighbors, Mr. Snowden's a stand-up guy, I have a great relationship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13043)|
| 3:37:27| with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13047)|
| 3:37:28| Neither of us would let this get out of hand or be abused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13048)|
| 3:37:31| But man, as much as I hate this, I will move that we deny the rezoning and leave the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13051)|
| 3:37:39| as per the recommendation of the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13059)|
| 3:37:43| Motion on the floor by Commissioner Beeler is to deny the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13063)|
| 3:37:46| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13066)|
| 3:37:47| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13067)|
| 3:37:48| Second by Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13068)|
| 3:37:49| Is there any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13069)|
| 3:37:52| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13072)|
| 3:37:54| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13074)|

| 3:38:06| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13086)|
| 3:38:07| I don't know how to state it properly, but I appreciate your time and I do wish you the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13087)|
| 3:38:11| best on your business, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13091)|
| 3:38:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13095)|
| 3:38:16| Is there any other zoning business that's before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13096)|
| 3:38:23| Seeing none, we are going to motion to adjourn zoning and we will return at 9 o'clock and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13103)|
| 3:38:29| continue our business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13109)|
| 3:38:30| Anybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13110)|
| 3:38:31| Do I need a motion to adjourn zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13111)|
| 3:38:36| Motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13116)|
| 3:38:41| And call back to order our County Commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13121)|
| 3:38:44| I'm going to move one thing up on our agenda and that's going to be the resolution that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13124)|
| 3:38:51| has no number that was added to our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13131)|
| 3:38:55| This is R2010-803.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13135)|
| 3:38:59| I don't think we need to do roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13139)|
| 3:39:01| Do we need to do roll call again when we come back in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13141)|
| 3:39:07| I think all members are present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13147)|

| 3:39:18| This does not have a formal number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13158)|
| 3:39:20| This was one that was added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13160)|

| 3:39:56| Commissioner Daley, I see one, and maybe Matt Myers, you want to lead us off with a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13196)|
| 3:39:59| conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13199)|

| 3:40:19| you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13219)|

| 3:40:25| meeting tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13225)|
| 3:40:28| That document, if not executed, was set to expire November 6th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13228)|
| 3:40:32| So that's the reason for the withdrawal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13232)|
| 3:40:35| And then we came back with asking you to approve an extension of the purchase and sale agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13235)|

| 3:41:35| We plan to spend right under $10 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13295)|
| 3:41:38| There'll be a floor that schools could decide to move in as early as spring break, but we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13298)|
| 3:41:45| tend to think they want to wait and move in everything at one time, so probably be at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13305)|
| 3:41:50| the end of the summer or before the start of the school year, but everything's on time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13310)|

| 3:42:03| That's not ours, so that belongs to TVA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13323)|
| 3:42:05| They are doing, that's the chiller, and that's their expense, and that's their crane, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13325)|
| 3:42:11| that's their worksite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13331)|
| 3:42:12| Can we do an individual tour of the progress?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13332)|
| 3:42:18| Yeah, we right now is just currently in the demo phase, and so all you would see now is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13338)|

| 3:42:28| We can show you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13348)|
| 3:42:29| I mean, I'm sure we can probably get on a floor, but yeah, so right now it's just demoing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13349)|
| 3:42:35| carpet walls and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13355)|
| 3:42:37| Are we doing anything with the garage, I'm sorry, summer place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13357)|
| 3:42:40| Summer place, so we built summer place, and so our first thought process on summer place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13360)|
| 3:42:47| is handling of the parking area, and so we're going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13367)|
| 3:42:53| We've got to work on the chiller, which we've got a timeline by TVA where they're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13373)|
| 3:42:57| to cut off cold water, so we're working on that, but as far as the other piece of summer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13377)|
| 3:43:04| place, it's more in phase two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13384)|
| 3:43:07| I had heard that there was a water break on the bottom floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13387)|
| 3:43:12| No, there was a water line break in the basement, excuse me, in the sub-level of the east and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13392)|
| 3:43:24| west tower, but that's what TVA worked to fix before we closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13404)|
| 3:43:29| That's TVA's problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13409)|
| 3:43:30| Yeah, and they fixed it and did all new everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13410)|
| 3:43:34| Can you shoot those numbers to Drusilla, and thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13414)|
| 3:43:39| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13419)|
| 3:43:40| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13420)|
| 3:43:43| I'm going to stick to the topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13423)|
| 3:43:46| B&A has had to make a modification in their plan due to economic uncertainty created by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13426)|
| 3:43:52| COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13432)|
| 3:43:54| This deal was originally scheduled to close a year, year and a half ago, two years ago?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13434)|
| 3:44:03| Yeah, about two, two and a half years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13443)|
| 3:44:06| RFP was awarded in 17, so they've been a good partner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13446)|
| 3:44:09| If everything would have went as planned, we would probably, chances are you could try| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13449)|
| 3:44:15| to get a room over there right now, a hotel room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13455)|
| 3:44:18| I think B&A stood by us a long time, waiting for us to be ready to confirm that we could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13458)|
| 3:44:27| move out of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13467)|
| 3:44:30| At the same time, given the commercial market industry right now, I know the residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13470)|
| 3:44:38| is through the roof, but commercial space is falling like a rock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13478)|
| 3:44:44| I think it would be wise of us to give them as much time as we need and try to find a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13484)|
| 3:44:50| way to protect the price we currently have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13490)|
| 3:44:55| Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13495)|
| 3:44:58| I was going to see, Commissioner Smith, what amount of time are you thinking, just like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13498)|
| 3:45:04| 30, 60, after the first of the year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13504)|
| 3:45:08| Well, I think the time frame they put on it right now, it will give them a good indication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13508)|
| 3:45:14| of if this is going to be able to work or not, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13514)|
| 3:45:19| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13519)|
| 3:45:20| We're meeting with them tomorrow to start the discussion of what we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13520)|
| 3:45:24| We're asking for an extension of the purchase and sale agreement through December 31st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13524)|
| 3:45:29| I think we can hopefully have something for you by December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13529)|
| 3:45:34| One final question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13534)|
| 3:45:36| Commissioner Smith, you can continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13536)|
| 3:45:39| How many times did we have to ask for an extension throughout this process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13539)|
| 3:45:43| Not for our benefit, not theirs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13543)|
| 3:45:46| We never had a set close date on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13546)|
| 3:45:48| I don't know that we've done any, that we've asked for any extensions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13548)|
| 3:45:51| It's just been the process that we've gone through with our RFP and awarding and development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13551)|
| 3:45:57| agreement and TVA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13557)|
| 3:46:00| And it was stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13560)|
| 3:46:01| They knew that we were working through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13561)|
| 3:46:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13564)|
| 3:46:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=13565)|

| 3:59:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=14370)|
| 3:59:31| Jim, I wanted to give you a chance to explain this project at Centerpoint Boulevard and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=14371)|

| 3:59:40| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=14380)|
| 3:59:41| An opportunity to let the public know what kind of road improvements we're currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=14381)|
| 3:59:45| contracting to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=14385)|
| 3:59:47| Yeah, I'd be glad to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=14387)|
| 3:59:49| Yeah, this is an important project for us to further the safety along Pellissippi Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=14389)|
| 3:59:56| Anybody that's ever drove in Pellissippi Parkway realizes it's interstate volume and interstate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=14396)|
| 4:00:00| speed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=14400)|
| 4:00:01| You're looking at, depending on what section you're in, this section in particular carries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=14401)|
| 4:00:05| about 60,000 cars a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=14405)|
| 4:00:07| And those cars are traveling anywhere from, you know, 65 to 70 miles an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=14407)|
| 4:00:11| And by implementing this project, we are going to remove the at-grade intersection at Centerpoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=14411)|
| 4:00:17| and Pellissippi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=14417)|
| 4:00:19| Right now, it is a right in, right out, which still isn't the most safe configuration even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=14419)|
| 4:00:25| under those volumes and speeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=14425)|
| 4:00:28| So this project will eliminate that access, and it will then make every one along Centerpoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=14428)|
| 4:00:34| come down to Lovell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=14434)|
| 4:00:36| And we're installing turn lanes and a signalized intersection there so that people can get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=14436)|
| 4:00:42| out easier on to Lovell once we take away the right in, right out along Centerpoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=14442)|
| 4:00:48| at Pellissippi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=14448)|
| 4:00:49| It hopefully at some point then allows TDOT to have a more complete access control facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=14449)|
| 4:00:56| along Pellissippi, which is ultimately what everyone would like with the traffic volumes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=14456)|
| 4:01:00| and speeds there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=14460)|
| 4:01:02| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=14462)|

| 4:02:00| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=14520)|
| 4:02:01| Didn't one of the commissioners during the work session ask a question about this and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=14521)|
| 4:02:05| they were going to get back to us with an answer or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=14525)|
| 4:02:09| I'm trying to remember roughly what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=14529)|
| 4:02:11| Was that Commissioner Ward or Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=14531)|
| 4:02:13| I asked the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=14533)|
| 4:02:14| I spoke with Kevin at the Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=14534)|
| 4:02:17| Can you pull it a little closer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=14537)|
| 4:02:19| I asked the question at our work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=14539)|
| 4:02:22| I did speak with Kevin at the Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=14542)|
| 4:02:27| He gave me the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=14547)|
| 4:02:29| We are, I believe, only planning to use that facility one day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=14549)|
| 4:02:33| And the explanation that was given for the cost was typically they rent that building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=14553)|
| 4:02:39| for $1,500 a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=14559)|
| 4:02:40| You would think they're probably not able to rent it right now, but they do have a minimum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=14560)|
| 4:02:46| cost to cover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=14566)|
| 4:02:49| I guess the county was told the electric bill there is $10,000 to $15,000 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=14569)|
| 4:02:54| So $250 was the price that they came to per day that it's going to be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=14574)|
| 4:03:02| And I think the Health Department only has one scheduled day to use that facility moving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=14582)|
| 4:03:08| forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=14588)|
| 4:03:09| If you could state your name and department, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=14589)|
| 4:03:11| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=14591)|
| 4:03:12| Martha Buchanan, Knox County Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=14592)|
| 4:03:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=14593)|
| 4:03:14| So, apparently our plans are to only use that facility one more time for a, I believe it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=14594)|
| 4:03:20| for a flu vaccine clinic sometime later this month or maybe next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=14600)|
| 4:03:27| The explanation was, because we had been using it for free, and then the city came to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=14607)|
| 4:03:33| and said what Commissioner Smith just said, that the costs were this and they normally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=14613)|
| 4:03:38| rent it for $1,500 a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=14618)|
| 4:03:41| I learned that talking to Kevin too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=14621)|
| 4:03:44| So, $250 was a lot lower than $1,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=14624)|
| 4:03:49| And Kevin did, even though it's only going to be one day, did tell me that there is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=14629)|

| 4:12:40| I decided to allow her to continue to attend school because it's school that is helping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15160)|

| 4:12:54| And while her risk of contracting COVID is greater than most students, the greatest risk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15174)|
| 4:12:59| she faces is from those who do not follow all of the proven safety measures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15179)|
| 4:13:05| Whose responsibility is it to protect my daughter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15185)|
| 4:13:08| Of course, it's mine and my husband's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15188)|
| 4:13:11| However, others are responsible as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15191)|
| 4:13:13| Her classmates, her teacher, her principal, the school system in general, our government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15193)|
| 4:13:18| officials, our community, and even those who support the Board of Health and protest it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15198)|
| 4:13:26| as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15206)|
| 4:13:28| We have learned a lot about ourselves and our community because of COVID-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15208)|
| 4:13:33| Some of it is good, some of it not so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15213)|
| 4:13:36| I've already mentioned the commitment and dedication demonstrated by medical and public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15216)|
| 4:13:40| safety professionals, including my colleague from District 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15220)|
| 4:13:45| But what is obviously lacking is that same commitment by the rest of us, the commitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15225)|
| 4:13:50| to civic responsibility, the commitment to something bigger than ourselves, the commitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15230)|
| 4:13:54| to each other as friends and neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15234)|

| 4:14:04| If Knox County experienced floods and those floods began wiping out neighborhoods, there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15244)|
| 4:14:11| no question people would volunteer and without hesitation be compelled by their sense of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15251)|
| 4:14:19| civic duty and risk themselves to save others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15259)|
| 4:14:24| So certainly there have been some exceptions of just regular folk rising, risking themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15264)|
| 4:14:30| to help others during this pandemic, but they are exceptions and not, unfortunately, not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15270)|
| 4:14:34| the rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15274)|

| 4:14:53| Yes, we are all individual trees in the forest we call Knox County, but without the forest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15293)|
| 4:14:58| that's all we are, single individual lonely trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15298)|
| 4:15:02| It is the other trees in the forest that protect us from the blazing sun and howling winds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15302)|
| 4:15:06| whose roots help us keep our soil from washing away and nourishing us during droughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15306)|
| 4:15:13| And as we heard earlier from Mr. Hildebrand, who so graciously donated the AED device to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15313)|

| 4:15:28| And I will leave you with the words of my seven-year-old, I'm sorry, we need to be safe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15328)|
| 4:15:35| respectful, responsible, and kind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15335)|
| 4:15:40| Thank you, Commissioner Durrett, Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15340)|
| 4:15:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15348)|

| 4:15:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15351)|
| 4:15:52| I did have a question for Commissioner Ward about whose appointments these would be and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15352)|
| 4:16:02| who would actually be responsible for seeing to it that these meetings happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15362)|
| 4:16:09| Where is all this administratively?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15369)|
| 4:16:11| Do you see it falling?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15371)|
| 4:16:13| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15373)|
| 4:16:15| The mayor would appoint, we would approve, and then they would be at the request, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15375)|
| 4:16:20| meetings would be at the request of the commission or the mayor to work on a particular project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15380)|
| 4:16:25| or give advice on a particular subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15385)|
| 4:16:28| So it would be the mayor's, someone in the mayor's office responsibility to be the administrator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15388)|
| 4:16:35| so to speak, of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15395)|
| 4:16:36| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15396)|
| 4:16:37| I assume they would select their own, you know, chair and secretary and all the rest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15397)|
| 4:16:41| of that kind of stuff as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15401)|
| 4:16:43| And I originally suggested that they meet at least once a year, but if there's a particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15403)|
| 4:16:48| thing that the mayor wanted advice on or that we as a commission would want advice on, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15408)|
| 4:16:53| would request that they would show up at the commission or the mayor would put a request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15413)|
| 4:16:56| in, hey, could you look into this topic or that topic and give a recommendation as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15416)|
| 4:17:00| group from all angles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15420)|
| 4:17:03| It's more of a consulting group of people to give advice more than anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15423)|
| 4:17:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15430)|
| 4:17:11| I did hear Commissioner Jay's concerns last week about, not concerns, but just his reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15431)|
| 4:17:20| of all the committees and experts that we have already throughout the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15440)|
| 4:17:28| Talk to me again why you feel like this, another committee is needed to address concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15448)|
| 4:17:38| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15458)|
| 4:17:40| We're concentrating a lot on health and I get that because of the current situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15460)|
| 4:17:44| This takes a more full-rounded approach to any particular topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15464)|
| 4:17:50| And like I said in the past meeting, I have selected as a CEO the people that I want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15470)|
| 4:17:56| consult me and to give me advice and to give me as well-rounded as possible advice for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15476)|
| 4:18:04| my decisions that I make, just trying to give the mayor the same opportunity to form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15484)|
| 4:18:11| a team around him that, you know, to give him advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15491)|
| 4:18:14| There's nothing stopping him from still taking advice from all the things that Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15494)|
| 4:18:19| or Chairman Jay said last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15499)|
| 4:18:22| This is just another tool in his arsenal or our arsenal in that case to have a better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15502)|
| 4:18:30| more information or opinion or even a different opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15510)|
| 4:18:33| So that's all it is, just the more information the better and this isn't a singletary specialty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15513)|
| 4:18:41| committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15521)|
| 4:18:42| I'm trying to make it as well-rounded as possible basically, so it's a more well-rounded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15522)|
| 4:18:47| committee basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15527)|
| 4:18:50| Commissioner Beeler and then I'm going to weigh in on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15530)|
| 4:18:53| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15533)|
| 4:18:55| It is difficult to follow the words of my colleague from the Second District, I will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15535)|
| 4:19:01| admit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15541)|
| 4:19:03| I just want to say that I support this resolution for this reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15543)|
| 4:19:10| If Knox County were to decide that we're not going to handle our public health decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15550)|
| 4:19:17| the way we've been handling them, correct me if I'm wrong, Commissioner Smith, we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15557)|
| 4:19:23| the only county in the state that handles them this particular way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15563)|
| 4:19:26| You are correct, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15566)|
| 4:19:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15569)|
| 4:19:32| It is my opinion that these sorts of decisions should be handled by the county's health officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15572)|
| 4:19:38| which in our case is Dr. Buchanan, because she is the designee of the elected mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15578)|
| 4:19:45| I believe these should be executive branch decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15585)|
| 4:19:50| Legislative bodies are not really crafted to handle emergency management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15590)|
| 4:19:59| Executive action tends to move much too slowly to handle emergency management properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15599)|
| 4:20:05| But the elected executive branch does have a health officer that is his designee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15605)|
| 4:20:10| And if these decisions were to fall to the executive branch, I do think it would be good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15610)|
| 4:20:16| for the executive, the mayor, to have a body that he put together to advise him on these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15616)|
| 4:20:24| types of issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15624)|
| 4:20:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15626)|
| 4:20:28| Thank you, Commissioner Buehler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15628)|
| 4:20:29| I want to weigh in on this as seat 11, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15629)|
| 4:20:35| I outlined last week why I thought this was unnecessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15635)|
| 4:20:40| And I asked a really simple question that couldn't be answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15640)|
| 4:20:44| Why isn't this just bigger government?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15644)|
| 4:20:46| And why isn't it better government?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15646)|
| 4:20:49| This is another layer on top of another layer, or at least it's proposed that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15649)|
| 4:20:55| Right now we have 11 formal groups, boards, committees, or councils that are currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15655)|
| 4:21:00| working on health, economics, businesses, and numerous other things, including everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15660)|
| 4:21:08| that's going on with COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15668)|
| 4:21:11| We have eight subcommittees that are doing that on top of all of, within all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15671)|
| 4:21:17| We have hundreds of people working on everything here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15677)|
| 4:21:21| And I heard just recently, I mean, just in these comments, Commissioner Ward, you said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15681)|
| 4:21:26| this is not necessarily health-focused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15686)|
| 4:21:29| But in your proposal, six out of the 11 people on the committee are directly related to health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15689)|
| 4:21:36| virologists, epidemiologists, psychologists, social workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15696)|
| 4:21:40| I mean, these are medical professionals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15700)|
| 4:21:43| This is entirely set up as a medically-focused body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15703)|
| 4:21:47| Otherwise, a majority of the people on there wouldn't be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15707)|
| 4:21:52| I also heard that if the mayor or commission wants advice on, they could call on this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15712)|
| 4:21:57| We haven't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15717)|
| 4:21:59| There's almost nobody that we can't call on at any given time for advice on anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15719)|
| 4:22:04| The health department has four epidemiologists on staff right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15724)|
| 4:22:10| We can call on them anytime, and none of us have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15730)|
| 4:22:14| Matt Murray has been before this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15734)|
| 4:22:16| He is the chief and expert economist at the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15736)|
| 4:22:20| He's advised us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15740)|

| 4:22:23| Nobody's asked him anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15743)|
| 4:22:25| We have psychologists and social workers at Helen Ross McNabb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15745)|
| 4:22:29| They're at our disposal right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15749)|
| 4:22:31| Nobody's ever called them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15751)|
| 4:22:33| We have numerous medical professionals, both within the Board of Health and every hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15753)|
| 4:22:38| in this town, that we can call on right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15758)|
| 4:22:42| And nobody's asked them for direct engagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15762)|
| 4:22:44| We have everything that is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15764)|
| 4:22:47| We have it all at our fingertips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15767)|
| 4:22:50| To create something new before you engage in something that we have is not better government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15770)|
| 4:22:56| It's substitute government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15776)|
| 4:22:59| Now, in the last week's discussion, it was said at the end of the night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15779)|
| 4:23:05| I know it was late, and we were all talking about it, and it was heated, but it was said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15785)|
| 4:23:11| by Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15791)|
| 4:23:13| We're all playing checkers, and he's playing chess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15793)|
| 4:23:17| Don't be fooled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15797)|
| 4:23:18| This is a pretty clear goal, is to put something in place so you can say you have something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15798)|
| 4:23:28| The next step is to dissolve the Board of Health, and you can say, well, we have this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15808)|
| 4:23:31| other group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15811)|
| 4:23:33| Then all the powers revert back to the health director, and then all the pressure goes on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15813)|
| 4:23:37| the mayor, and then they can start gutting the health department one by one by one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15817)|
| 4:23:40| In the middle of a pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15820)|
| 4:23:43| But beyond all of that, beyond people's focus on constitutional mandates or constitutionality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15823)|
| 4:23:51| of this, these are all things that are set up on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15831)|
| 4:23:54| We're fighting something that's set up on a state level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15834)|
| 4:23:57| If you think it's unconstitutional, file a lawsuit in federal court and go to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15837)|
| 4:24:02| If you think this is the wrong way to do it, go to your state legislators and get them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15842)|
| 4:24:06| to change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15846)|
| 4:24:08| I just heard, just two seconds ago, from Commissioner Beeler, the only county in the state to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15848)|
| 4:24:13| it this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15853)|
| 4:24:14| Yet, almost everybody on this body exactly said, we should have the only county that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15854)|
| 4:24:19| has our own elected law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15859)|
| 4:24:22| Because we know better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15862)|
| 4:24:25| You can't have it both ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15865)|
| 4:24:27| Either we're a sovereign county that has rights to do things the way that we want to do them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15867)|
| 4:24:33| and the rights to say we want an elected law director, and we don't want to be like the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15873)|
| 4:24:36| other half of the state, or the rest of the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15876)|
| 4:24:38| But these are tactics to win the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15878)|
| 4:24:41| These are not philosophies of government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15881)|
| 4:24:43| And I really think what you're looking at here is not better government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15883)|
| 4:24:48| It's bigger government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15888)|
| 4:24:49| It's putting another layer on top of another layer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15889)|
| 4:24:51| And we have everything at our disposal, but we have to use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15891)|
| 4:24:56| Nobody's called and had any discussions with the Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15896)|
| 4:24:59| Nobody's gone and talked to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15899)|
| 4:25:00| Nobody's written a letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15900)|
| 4:25:02| Nobody's talked to all the people that I mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15902)|
| 4:25:04| And I listed tons and tons and tons of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15904)|
| 4:25:06| They're at our disposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15906)|
| 4:25:07| But this commission is not using them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15907)|
| 4:25:09| To add one more on top of it seems absolutely redundant, and it seems a complete waste of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15909)|
| 4:25:14| time when we have all of it at our disposal and we can use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15914)|
| 4:25:18| I don't know where the lights were, but I believe it was Smith, Daley, and Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15918)|
| 4:25:23| And Lundy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15923)|
| 4:25:24| So I'll start in that order, unless you tell me otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15924)|
| 4:25:26| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15926)|
| 4:25:27| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15927)|
| 4:25:28| First, I'm not sure how you know who all anybody on this board's talked to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15928)|
| 4:25:34| Please don't speak for me whenever you say nobody's reached out to anybody, because I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15934)|
| 4:25:38| have talked to people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15938)|
| 4:25:40| Second, this is not dissolving the Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15940)|
| 4:25:44| I think the way the statues are written, you have to have a Board of Health, and they would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15944)|
| 4:25:47| remain even as an advisory to the health director, the chief director of the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15947)|
| 4:25:55| A lot of these committees that you're talking about are dealing with very specific things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15955)|
| 4:26:01| We heard that the health council has one basic objective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15961)|
| 4:26:07| I believe that's what you said, Dr. Buchanan, to come up with a five-year plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15967)|
| 4:26:11| Pretty close?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15971)|
| 4:26:15| This seems to be a well-rounded group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15975)|
| 4:26:18| Yes, there are six people in the medical field, but they are in different aspects of the medical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15978)|
| 4:26:23| field from psychology to biological medicine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15983)|
| 4:26:30| I think this is a group that, just take the health board issue out of it completely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15990)|
| 4:26:38| This is a group that I think could help us with homeless, mental health, suicide, overdose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=15998)|
| 4:26:45| could help us with plans that maybe we need information and direction when we do our budgeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=16005)|
| 4:26:53| to address some of these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=16013)|
| 4:26:55| I think this is very different than these other groups because of the makeup of it and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=16015)|
| 4:27:01| the specific target of it is different than a lot of these other committees that you mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=16021)|
| 4:27:16| I'm going to support it because I think that we could get information from them that could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=16036)|
| 4:27:20| help us disregarding the current situation we're in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=16040)|
| 4:27:24| Moving forward, there's a lot of things that affect the quality of life that, given a good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=16044)|
| 4:27:31| body of well-rounded professions, people coming together, can come up with creative, good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=16051)|
| 4:27:37| ideas they can pass on to us that we might be able to incorporate into our budget and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=16057)|
| 4:27:42| our policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=16062)|
| 4:27:43| Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=16063)|
| 4:27:44| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=16064)|
| 4:27:45| We're not perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=16065)|
| 4:27:46| I mean, there's only one perfect person that ever lived and he was crucified for recused| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=16066)|
| 4:27:59| to not being perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=16079)|
| 4:28:01| I agree with Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=16081)|
| 4:28:03| I can see this as a different type of committee, advisory committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=16083)|
| 4:28:09| It's well-rounded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=16089)|
| 4:28:10| It's got business people in it where the Board of Health does not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=16090)|
| 4:28:14| That's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=16094)|
| 4:28:16| It's got other doctors and offices there that the mayor needs to know how these people feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=16096)|
| 4:28:24| And I don't think he's getting that advice from an advisory committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=16104)|
| 4:28:30| He probably is getting it individually by asking questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=16110)|
| 4:28:34| So I'll be supporting this, hopefully that it will turn out to be a good committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=16114)|
| 4:28:43| Some committees, we've got a committee on committees and we're finding out that committees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=16123)|
| 4:28:49| may only meet once a year or something, but when they're needed, they're needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=16129)|
| 4:28:55| And even if this committee doesn't meet but one time a year, thank you, because that means| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=16135)|
| 4:29:01| everything's going great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=16141)|
| 4:29:02| But when we're in a pandemic or we're in a situation that we're in right now, all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=16142)|
| 4:29:08| advice that we can get is all the advice that the mayor can get, that we can draw from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=16148)|
| 4:29:16| And I know the chairman says that we have all these other different committees that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=16156)|
| 4:29:21| are going on, but we've not heard from those committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=16161)|
| 4:29:25| Those committees ought to be coming to us, filling us in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=16165)|
| 4:29:28| It's not our responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=16168)|
| 4:29:29| It shouldn't be our responsibility to go say, hey, committee, you need to come to report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=16169)|
| 4:29:34| to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=16174)|
| 4:29:35| They should be able, they should be coming to us in a time of crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=16175)|
| 4:29:40| Those committees need to be informing us on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=16180)|
| 4:29:43| So I will be supporting this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=16183)|
| 4:29:44| I did have a couple of phone calls and they both, and only two phone calls on this situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=16184)|
| 4:29:53| right here, emails that you all got too, but the phone calls were, you know, after I explained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=16193)|
| 4:29:59| my position, that the more information I feel that we have, the better off we will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=16199)|
| 4:30:04| be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=16204)|
| 4:30:05| I don't know if I changed their mind, but I told them that I would be voting for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=16205)|
| 4:30:11| And they were polite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=16211)|
| 4:30:12| They were considered and they said, commissioner, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=16212)|
| 4:30:15| So I will be supporting the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=16215)|
| 4:30:18| Commissioner Vicks, I was just wondering, Commissioner Ward, well, there's a couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=16218)|
| 4:30:24| of things that I'm wondering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=16224)|
| 4:30:25| One is, so when will Mayor Jacobs be doing the appointments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=16225)|
| 4:30:30| Because one of the things that we haven't talked about in quite some time, well, there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=16230)|
| 4:30:33| two things that we haven't talked about in quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=16233)|
| 4:30:38| We spoke with Dr. Buchanan last year about indigent care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=16238)|
| 4:30:43| And then we kind of, on the tail end of that conversation, almost inadvertently got into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=16243)|
| 4:30:48| mental health, if you remember, and we were kind of talking about mental health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=16248)|
| 4:30:52| So during that time, the city, I've been told, is going to have kind of a mental health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=16252)|
| 4:30:57| facility at the old St. Mary's building, maybe a floor or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=16257)|
| 4:31:02| You may not know about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=16262)|
| 4:31:04| I kind of caught that drift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=16264)|
| 4:31:05| And then I've been told that there's a mental health facility looking at being opened up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=16265)|
| 4:31:09| somewhere on Middlebrook Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=16269)|
| 4:31:10| I got a zoning issue over by Maloneyville Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=16270)|
| 4:31:15| So it sounds like we're going to have some mental health help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=16275)|
| 4:31:19| I don't know how the BHUC is in Commissioner Smith's district, but I would like to be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=16279)|
| 4:31:25| to know whenever this would be formed, because I have questions about that, as well as I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=16285)|
| 4:31:30| been approached multiple times about affordable housing, especially within the city, given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=16290)|
| 4:31:35| the homeless situation that we've been really looking into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=16295)|
| 4:31:41| So just kind of, if you could just let me know when you think you would be making these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=16301)|
| 4:31:45| field, when would we be able to meet and fire off questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=16305)|
| 4:31:51| Because I feel like right now, time is kind of of the essence, especially in those two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=16311)|
| 4:31:55| things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=16315)|
| 4:31:56| Those are really big in my playbook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=16316)|
| 4:31:58| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=16318)|
| 4:31:59| My understanding would be that he would make the appointments over the next 30 days, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=16319)|
| 4:32:03| we would appoint them at the next month's commission meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=16323)|
| 4:32:06| And at that point in time, once they're appointed, we can task them with, hey, we want you to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=16326)|
| 4:32:14| take a look and tackle these issues and give us a recommendation for these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=16334)|
| 4:32:18| So almost like legislative affairs, kind of, but we just focus solely on, you know, obviously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=16338)|
| 4:32:23| local things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=16343)|
| 4:32:24| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=16344)|
| 4:32:25| Like, I would like, the things that I just said, I would like for them to be able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=16345)|
| 4:32:27| look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=16347)|
| 4:32:28| Is there any way we, like, we would just kind of, we would almost be like a legislative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=16348)|
| 4:32:32| affairs committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=16352)|
| 4:32:33| We would just approach them with the list of things to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=16353)|
| 4:32:35| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=16355)|
| 4:32:36| And then they come back to us the following month, and then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=16356)|
| 4:32:39| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=16359)|
| 4:32:40| So that's the way I kind of envisioned it, is they get appointed next month, hopefully,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=16360)|
| 4:32:45| and then we can turn and say, hey, we've got a homeless issue we want you to tackle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=16365)|
| 4:32:50| We've got a housing issue we want you to tackle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=16370)|
| 4:32:52| Please as a group, go get together, make a formal recommendation with all the different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=16372)|

| 4:33:27| So, in theory, so in the last 10, 12 years we had a recession in 08, 09, so say for example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=16407)|

| 4:52:21| There's three things I always do when you go into a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=17541)|
| 4:52:23| Can you lean forward to the mic, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=17543)|
| 4:52:25| There's three things that I do, I put in when I'm looking at something that's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=17545)|
| 4:52:32| First of all, there's goals, results, and challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=17552)|
| 4:52:37| My goals are not your goals, or anybody else's on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=17557)|
| 4:52:43| My results is different from probably everybody else's on here, and my challenge is, how can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=17563)|
| 4:52:50| we consolidate that into what you're trying to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=17570)|
| 4:52:53| That's all I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=17573)|
| 4:52:55| I'm not quite sure I completely understand the question you're asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=17575)|
| 4:53:01| See, you have a committee that you want to put together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=17581)|
| 4:53:04| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=17584)|
| 4:53:06| You want to accomplish something because you have a goal, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=17586)|
| 4:53:11| What I look at that committee may not be the same goals as what yours are, but could be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=17591)|
| 4:53:17| used in what I may want to do for my district and things like that, too, to get them information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=17597)|
| 4:53:25| Neither of my challenges are different from your challenges in putting that committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=17605)|
| 4:53:29| together and what I'm looking for to get out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=17609)|
| 4:53:32| Those three things, how do we get together and consolidate our goals and challenges and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=17612)|
| 4:53:38| results that do for the common good, is what I'm trying to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=17618)|
| 4:53:44| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=17624)|
| 4:53:45| I think what you're trying to get at is, so the discussion that Commissioner Biggs and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=17625)|
| 4:53:54| I just had, and actually Dr. Lundy, I think that you brought it up, we have some challenges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=17634)|
| 4:54:00| in our homeless and our housing issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=17640)|
| 4:54:04| These are things that we just talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=17644)|
| 4:54:06| What are our goals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=17646)|
| 4:54:07| We kind of discussed that a little bit about we need to fix these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=17647)|
| 4:54:11| The challenge is, hey, let's give this to this new committee to tackle for us and kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=17651)|
| 4:54:18| of bring back to us and say, hey, these are your options from a whole perspective, not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=17658)|
| 4:54:24| just a medical professional or psychological or economical, but all three at once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=17664)|
| 4:54:30| Hopefully that kind of answers the question of the way I look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=17670)|
| 4:54:33| This is just one example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=17673)|
| 4:54:35| There's multiple ways we can attack different problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=17675)|
| 4:54:38| This is just another tool in our arsenal to solve some of these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=17678)|
| 4:54:42| I think it's healthy for us to have discussions at our work sessions to say, hey, is there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=17682)|
| 4:54:50| anything this month that we want this committee to work on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=17690)|
| 4:54:54| I think that should be a regular, normal topic at the end of every single work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=17694)|
| 4:54:59| Like, hey, is there anything that we all are thinking of that we don't have answers to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=17699)|
| 4:55:03| or we want to explore?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=17703)|
| 4:55:06| Let's hand the ball off to them and see what they can do with it and kind of give us some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=17706)|
| 4:55:11| direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=17711)|
| 4:55:12| I don't want to think very single-mindedly about what this could do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=17712)|
| 4:55:16| It could be multiple, Swiss Army knife kind of committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=17716)|
| 4:55:21| What I'm saying is, my passion is different from your passion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=17721)|
| 4:55:25| We're having a discussion here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=17725)|
| 4:55:28| I understand, but what's the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=17728)|

| 5:02:09| I talked to the law director and we took everything out except for the part that the health board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18129)|
| 5:02:17| holds public forum like we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18137)|

| 5:02:33| Section O of the Board of Health rules outlines how they have public forum now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18153)|
| 5:02:39| Have you ever talked to the chair of the Board of Health and asked them to adjust their rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18159)|
| 5:02:45| to match ours?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18165)|
| 5:02:46| I have not, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18166)|
| 5:02:53| If county commission changes its rules on public forum, do they have to match us like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18173)|
| 5:03:03| each time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18183)|
| 5:03:04| Let's say we go back into a full lockdown and we're on Zoom and we change how we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18184)|
| 5:03:10| public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18190)|
| 5:03:11| Do they mirror us in retrospect every time we might change something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18191)|
| 5:03:16| Not if that's the law director, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18196)|
| 5:03:18| Or is this simply stating that how their rules should lay out is exactly how our rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18198)|
| 5:03:23| should lay out when it comes to public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18203)|

| 5:03:37| That's the guts of what all this ordinance that Mr. Ward had me draw up is, is having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18217)|
| 5:03:43| public forum for the Board of Health because it's making decisions and policies and regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18223)|

| 5:03:52| And as Mr. Ward came to me to ask me, he felt like if they should have the same input or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18232)|
| 5:04:00| the public should have the same right to input to the Board of Health as it does to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18240)|

| 5:04:13| same rules as Commission follows to most extent, with the exception of maybe this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18253)|
| 5:04:19| I don't know if they're word for word, but our rules give the chair and the body lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18259)|
| 5:04:24| of leeway on how to adjust things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18264)|
| 5:04:27| If the chair of the Board of Health decided they wanted to do something different and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18267)|
| 5:04:30| the body agreed to it, could they do what we do often, which is to adapt and change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18270)|
| 5:04:36| our rules according to the amount of things on our agenda, the time, the number of speakers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18276)|
| 5:04:41| things like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18281)|
| 5:04:42| Those are procedural matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18282)|
| 5:04:44| What order do they do on the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18284)|
| 5:04:45| Now one of your rules that we have honored, this body has honored, is the five minute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18285)|
| 5:04:50| rule for public forum with no limitations on who can speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18290)|
| 5:04:55| That's the issue as I see that Commissioner Ward wanted when I drafted this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18295)|
| 5:05:00| So could this body change that automatically?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18300)|
| 5:05:05| Certainly no, because it's a rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18305)|
| 5:05:06| You couldn't come in and say, well, we're not going to have public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18306)|
| 5:05:09| You can't do that, because it's one of your rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18309)|
| 5:05:12| You can adjust how you adjust your agenda, which you have done, and that's okay, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18312)|
| 5:05:18| that's not what this goes to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18318)|
| 5:05:19| This goes to the public forum issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18319)|
| 5:05:21| Do they have the ability to suspend their rules?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18321)|
| 5:05:27| I don't think so, no, because you're putting it in the form of an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18327)|
| 5:05:33| This is going in as an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18333)|
| 5:05:35| So you're saying you must do this to the letter, no matter what, as written, as said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18335)|
| 5:05:41| I'm just asking the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18341)|
| 5:05:44| You're wanting to argue about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18344)|
| 5:05:46| The bottom line is, your rules are not ordinances, they're resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18346)|
| 5:05:51| This is going in as an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18351)|
| 5:05:54| It has a stronger effect than just a rule, but you can suspend your rules, that's correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18354)|
| 5:06:01| if you have a two-thirds vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18361)|
| 5:06:02| I'm just asking the questions to get clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18362)|
| 5:06:06| Are all of their other rules an ordinance, or are they just rules?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18366)|
| 5:06:09| They're just rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18369)|
| 5:06:10| They're not ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18370)|
| 5:06:11| Out of all their rules, there's only going to be one ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18371)|
| 5:06:14| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18374)|
| 5:06:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18375)|
| 5:06:16| Thank you for the clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18376)|
| 5:06:17| Commissioner Durrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18377)|
| 5:06:18| I also have a question for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18378)|
| 5:06:23| According to the Tennessee Code, we as a legislative body, county legislative body, establish a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18383)|
| 5:06:30| board of health and dissolve a board of health, but nowhere does it say we can regulate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18390)|
| 5:06:37| Could this potentially be kind of muddying up the Tennessee law?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18397)|
| 5:06:42| It doesn't say anything else that we have the purview of doing, aside from establishing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18402)|
| 5:06:48| and dissolving the board of health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18408)|
| 5:06:50| No, and I think I answered that question at the work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18410)|
| 5:06:54| This is no way, if you look at it, it takes no power away whatsoever from the board of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18414)|
| 5:06:58| health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18418)|
| 5:07:00| We still have the absolute power under the statute and under our ordinance, which established| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18420)|
| 5:07:05| it, to create these rules and regulations however they see fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18425)|
| 5:07:09| This doesn't impinge on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18429)|
| 5:07:11| This is just a procedural rather than a substantive rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18431)|
| 5:07:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18435)|
| 5:07:16| I have a concern that if we do this for one appointed board, who's to say that we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18436)|
| 5:07:24| end up having to do something like this for all appointed boards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18444)|
| 5:07:27| I just feel like this sets a precedent and possibly a slippery slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18447)|
| 5:07:31| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18451)|
| 5:07:33| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18453)|
| 5:07:34| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18454)|
| 5:07:38| The other appointed boards aren't making policies or laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18458)|
| 5:07:41| That's I guess the big difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18461)|
| 5:07:42| Could you come closer to your mic, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18462)|
| 5:07:45| The other appointed boards aren't making policy and laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18465)|
| 5:07:48| I guess that's the big difference in why I feel like they should have public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18468)|
| 5:07:54| Going back to the law director's point, this would be an ordinance, not a rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18474)|
| 5:07:58| It's an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18478)|
| 5:08:00| I would imagine if the chairman chose to not go by this ordinance, there would be calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18480)|
| 5:08:06| for removal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18486)|
| 5:08:09| I hate to put this burden on them, but we're having to take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18489)|
| 5:08:14| We don't get any say in what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18494)|
| 5:08:17| I am just a firm believer if you make policy and laws, you have to listen to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18497)|
| 5:08:25| It's a simple democratic process to me, and I'll be supporting this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18505)|
| 5:08:35| Mr. Law Director, did you have your light on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18515)|
| 5:08:38| Oh, no, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18518)|
| 5:08:40| Commissioner Lundy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18520)|
| 5:08:42| Honestly, I struggle with this because I do believe that people should voice their opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18522)|
| 5:08:52| On the flip side, everyone hasn't been to school for six, seven, eight, how many years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18532)|
| 5:08:59| I'm just wondering if it would just be so stressful on the Board of Health to have public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18539)|
| 5:09:06| They do have public forum now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18546)|
| 5:09:08| This is a different kind of public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18548)|
| 5:09:10| They do have public forum now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18550)|
| 5:09:12| I guess I don't understand the difference then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18552)|
| 5:09:16| If I could, I'll just read the current rule for public forum for the Board of Health States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18556)|
| 5:09:23| This is section O.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18563)|
| 5:09:26| The Board provides the public opportunity at Board meetings at least once monthly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18566)|
| 5:09:31| or at every meeting of the Board if the Board meets less frequently than once per month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18571)|
| 5:09:36| to address matters relevant to the duties and responsibilities of the Board to the Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18576)|
| 5:09:41| At the regularly scheduled Board meeting in which a public forum is scheduled to be held,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18581)|
| 5:09:45| public forum is at the beginning of the Board meeting as shown in rule I, section B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201026?start=18585)|
