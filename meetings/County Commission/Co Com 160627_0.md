| 0:03:25| On April 19, 2016, conducted underage beer sting at Lee's Market 7657 Clinton Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=205)|
| 0:03:38| purchased six-pack Bud Light Splash, and I.D. was checked and sold anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=218)|
| 0:03:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=226)|
| 0:03:47| Okay, Ms. Wilder, do you affirm or deny the allegations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=227)|
| 0:03:54| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=234)|

| 0:03:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=236)|
| 0:03:57| Well, at this time, you can tell this board anything that you feel will be relevant on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=237)|
| 0:04:03| your behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=243)|
| 0:04:04| Well, you know, what they've done, I mean, this is our third offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=244)|
| 0:04:09| What can you say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=249)|
| 0:04:10| Everybody's supposed to I.D. everybody, and, you know, not sell to a minor, so we really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=250)|
| 0:04:14| have nothing to, you know, I don't believe in doing it either, and so, like I said, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=254)|
| 0:04:19| just bad that it happened, and you just have to suffer the consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=259)|
| 0:04:25| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=265)|
| 0:04:27| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=267)|
| 0:04:30| Was it an owner or an employee that made the sale, and also the last couple of transactions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=270)|
| 0:04:36| you've been busted on, how were those, employee or owner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=276)|
| 0:04:40| It's been employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=280)|
| 0:04:43| I mean, I do have the employee that did this one, you know, we send them to the class,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=283)|
| 0:04:48| and I do have her card where she went to class, and she's no longer with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=288)|
| 0:04:52| Of course, we terminated her, but, you know, they do attend class, all of our employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=292)|
| 0:04:57| do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=297)|
| 0:04:58| Now, like I said, that's, we try to train them the best we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=298)|
| 0:05:05| Commissioner Oyenbee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=305)|
| 0:05:06| Yes, I understand you terminated the employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=306)|
| 0:05:11| When she checked the ID, did she, or I'm assuming, I don't know if it's a she or he, but it doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=311)|
| 0:05:16| matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=316)|
| 0:05:17| When they checked the ID, did they punch it in the computer, do you have it where they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=317)|
| 0:05:21| have to punch it in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=321)|
| 0:05:23| Yes, we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=323)|
| 0:05:25| This is the manager of the store, Amanda, and I'm going to let her kind of tell you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=325)|
| 0:05:29| that would be the best place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=329)|
| 0:05:33| The employee scanned the beer, and it wasn't in the, it came up unscannable, and she still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=333)|
| 0:05:39| asked for the ID because she knows she has to ask for it, and she read the year wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=339)|
| 0:05:43| But it didn't ask her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=343)|
| 0:05:46| Could I have your name and address for the record, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=346)|
| 0:05:49| Amanda Perry, 1736 Jerome Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=349)|
| 0:05:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=351)|
| 0:05:52| Okay, so, she just looked at the date wrong, so since it didn't show up in the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=352)|
| 0:05:58| She still asked for the ID, and then just read it wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=358)|
| 0:06:00| There was no indication for her to punch in an ID, because it's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=360)|
| 0:06:03| Yes, there wasn't, but she still asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=363)|
| 0:06:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=366)|
| 0:06:07| Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=367)|
| 0:06:08| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=368)|
| 0:06:13| I suppose the lady in blue...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=373)|
| 0:06:16| Can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=376)|
| 0:06:17| Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=377)|
| 0:06:18| How long has Lee's Markets had this location?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=378)|
| 0:06:24| We actually leased it from Warsh Petroleum, so we've had it for, I'm assuming, about five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=384)|
| 0:06:32| Well, I'm looking at a list from our clerk's office, and going back to 07, this is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=392)|
| 0:06:39| fifth time, so it looks like a troubled location to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=399)|
| 0:06:44| I've never been in there, but somebody's got problems somewhere there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=404)|
| 0:06:59| Commissioner Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=419)|
| 0:07:00| Yeah, thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=420)|
| 0:07:03| You know, I know you said it just happened, and we're allowed to suffer the consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=423)|
| 0:07:10| The last three years during prom season, they've come in there and tested to see, or run the sting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=430)|
| 0:07:19| Whoever it was, sold beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=439)|
| 0:07:21| So it seems like to me there's not enough emphasis from the top on pressure of don't screw this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=441)|
| 0:07:29| And I'm just saying we'll just have to suffer the consequences really does not, to me, show any urgency to get it fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=449)|
| 0:07:38| Well, I really didn't mean it in that sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=458)|
| 0:07:41| It's just that, you know, like I said, we send them to school, we train them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=461)|
| 0:07:48| They go to the class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=468)|
| 0:07:50| We try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=470)|
| 0:07:51| I mean, we've got 37 stores that sell beer, and we try our best to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=471)|
| 0:07:56| to emphasize to them how important it is not to sell to minors and to check those IDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=476)|
| 0:08:01| But with the exception of being there and holding their hand, I mean, I just don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=481)|
| 0:08:06| We're doing all that we possibly can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=486)|
| 0:08:08| I mean, it's not that I don't care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=488)|
| 0:08:09| I care a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=489)|
| 0:08:10| Well, let me ask you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=490)|
| 0:08:11| You said 37 stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=491)|
| 0:08:13| Do the other stores have this problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=493)|
| 0:08:15| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=495)|
| 0:08:16| Why is this store having a problem the last three Aprils getting busted for selling to underage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=496)|
| 0:08:23| Well, that's a good question, and I really have no answer for you because, like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=503)|
| 0:08:29| they're trained just like the other stores are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=509)|
| 0:08:32| It is in a bad neighborhood, which is no excuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=512)|
| 0:08:36| But like I said, I do apologize if I sound like when I said we just have to suffer the consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=516)|
| 0:08:42| I'm just saying we do care as a company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=522)|
| 0:08:45| I do not believe in selling to minors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=525)|
| 0:08:47| But like I said, we're doing all we can do, and we'll try to do more, especially for that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=527)|
| 0:08:56| But, you know, I mean, State of Tennessee, UID, everybody, how much plainer can you make it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=536)|
| 0:09:02| And, you know, you've got to specifically look at the date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=542)|
| 0:09:09| Like I said, we're doing all we can, and we'll try to do more for that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=549)|
| 0:09:15| Yeah, I would definitely do something more because this isn't working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=555)|
| 0:09:18| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=558)|
| 0:09:20| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=560)|
| 0:09:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=561)|
| 0:09:24| We have to go on precedent, and I think sometime in 2009 or so, is this the same one we suspended for 90 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=564)|
| 0:09:36| Same location, different owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=576)|
| 0:09:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=578)|
| 0:09:39| They've had their permit since 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=579)|
| 0:09:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=582)|
| 0:09:43| You've got your permit in 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=583)|
| 0:09:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=585)|
| 0:09:47| Last time we suspended them for 120 days, and the judge knocked it down to 92.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=587)|
| 0:09:52| So I'm going to make a motion that we suspend without the app.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=592)|
| 0:09:55| Mr. Law Director, can we suspend the location and not the owner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=595)|
| 0:10:00| Because this, I mean, they're just going to swap owners on us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=600)|
| 0:10:05| No, we won't because, I mean, we won't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=605)|
| 0:10:10| If you suspend, it affects the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=610)|
| 0:10:13| I know, but what if they go out of business and the next guy comes up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=613)|
| 0:10:18| If you suspend, it affects the site for a period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=618)|
| 0:10:21| I'll have to look and see because I think if you suspend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=621)|
| 0:10:24| If you revoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=624)|
| 0:10:25| Oh, if you revoke, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=625)|
| 0:10:26| Yeah, it's only if we revoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=626)|
| 0:10:27| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=627)|
| 0:10:28| I don't want to revoke the spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=628)|
| 0:10:30| I'm going to make a motion to suspend for 90 days without the option of paying a fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=630)|
| 0:10:36| I don't think a fine is going to do this one any good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=636)|
| 0:10:39| I don't think you say you care, but if they scanned a normal UPC on a normal brand of beer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=639)|
| 0:10:45| this wasn't a craft beer that they scanned the UPC on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=645)|
| 0:10:49| This is a normal brand of beer that should have been in your UPC bar reader.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=649)|
| 0:10:53| And so, I mean, you can say you care, but I'm going to make a motion we suspend 90 days without an option of a fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=653)|
| 0:11:01| Commissioner Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=661)|
| 0:11:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=663)|
| 0:11:04| And I'd also like to add that the argument that they read the date wrong doesn't sit well with me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=664)|
| 0:11:10| because the way the IDs are created, you don't have to look at the date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=670)|
| 0:11:15| There's a big red stripe that you should be able to see, and they made that specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160627?start=675)|
