| 0:00:31| Hello? Yeah, there we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=31)|
| 0:00:33| So it's 11.30. I know Chairman Hill will not be here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=33)|
| 0:00:36| I'm sitting in his place, unfortunately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=36)|
| 0:00:39| Tamara's not going to be here. Nathaniel's not going to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=39)|
| 0:00:42| Rich is not going to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=42)|
| 0:00:45| So I don't know if we have anybody else coming, but it's 11.30,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=45)|
| 0:00:48| so we're going to go ahead and go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=48)|
| 0:00:53| Welcome, everybody, to the January 10th Planning Commission agenda review meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=53)|
| 0:00:59| I'm going to turn it over to Executive Director Welch for his report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=59)|
| 0:01:05| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=65)|
| 0:01:06| I just have one item just to briefly chat with you about before we turn it over to our presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=66)|
| 0:01:14| If you recall at our last Planning Commission meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=74)|
| 0:01:16| we had some conversation had to do with right-of-way closures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=76)|
| 0:01:21| and there was some interpretation that maybe these right-of-way closures could be used for residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=81)|
| 0:01:27| or infill housing and that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=87)|
| 0:01:30| And just the communication that came across my desk not 30 minutes ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=90)|
| 0:01:34| but the law department has indicated that the right-of-way is not a fee ownership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=94)|
| 0:01:42| and that the city only possesses a right to improve these spaces for public use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=102)|
| 0:01:46| such as roads, sidewalks, greenways, and parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=106)|
| 0:01:49| So it's not something that they could retain and build on, apparently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=109)|
| 0:01:54| But I wanted to give you that heads-up that there's going to be conversation about that tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=114)|
| 0:01:59| regarding one of the right-of-way closures that we had at the Planning Commission last month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=119)|
| 0:02:03| and the law department will also provide additional information to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=123)|
| 0:02:09| But I'd probably ask that someone from the city law department or engineering come to our next meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=129)|
| 0:02:14| to just talk more about that to you so we have a complete knowledge of what is occurring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=134)|
| 0:02:19| when we're seeing a lot of right-of-way closures, particularly in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=139)|
| 0:02:23| and what are the opportunities or what are the limited opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=143)|
| 0:02:26| So I just wanted to make you aware of that interpretation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=146)|
| 0:02:31| and maybe my misinterpretation and others perhaps of what the opportunities are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=151)|
| 0:02:35| for right-of-way closures in the city would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=155)|
| 0:02:39| So with that, our February agenda looks, at least applications, looks relatively small compared to January,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=159)|
| 0:02:46| so depending on how many get postponed this month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=166)|
| 0:02:49| but we're sort of staff is looking for, glad to see a little bit of relief for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=169)|
| 0:02:55| So with that, Mr. Tilbury, if you'd like to come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=175)|
| 0:03:02| Kevin Tilbury is with the consulting firm that Knox County has retained,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=182)|
| 0:03:07| Kimley Horn, to prepare the advanced Knox general plan update for Knoxville, Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=187)|
| 0:03:15| in which Knoxville, Knox County Planning is participating in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=195)|
| 0:03:19| And he's going to give you an update of where we've been in the last six months or more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=199)|
| 0:03:24| and this presentation is also being made tonight to city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=204)|
| 0:03:29| and has been shared with other members of the county commissioners also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=209)|
| 0:03:34| So I'll turn it over to Kevin if you'd like to proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=214)|
| 0:03:39| Absolutely. Thanks, Jeff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=219)|
| 0:03:41| Again, my name is Kevin Tilbury. I'm with Kimley Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=221)|
| 0:03:43| We've been partnering with staff in developing advanced Knox, which is our name for the comprehensive plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=223)|
| 0:03:49| We just checked our notes, and I think it's been since April since we met with you last,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=229)|
| 0:03:53| so a lot has happened over the last nine months now it's been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=233)|
| 0:03:58| So I'm going to cover a lot of ground over the next 15 minutes or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=238)|
| 0:04:03| This is a 30-minute presentation, but I was only given 15 minutes, so I'm going to talk fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=243)|
| 0:04:08| I'll probably skip over a few things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=248)|
| 0:04:10| If you have questions, I'll be more than happy to come back and review some things with you at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=250)|
| 0:04:16| So I think we have time for Q&A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=256)|
| 0:04:18| All right, so what we want to talk to you today is, you know, we've done several things, I think, since we've talked to you last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=258)|
| 0:04:25| We've had a couple rounds of public outreach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=265)|
| 0:04:27| We want to share with you what the community told us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=267)|
| 0:04:30| We're creating what's called a preferred scenario, which is our collective vision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=270)|
| 0:04:35| Knox County for the future, and then we're going to shift gears and talk about what's next,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=275)|
| 0:04:39| what we're going to do with the information that we've gathered so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=279)|
| 0:04:42| So here's where we are in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=282)|
| 0:04:44| Since we spoke to you last, we've had two rounds of public outreach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=284)|
| 0:04:47| The first one collected input from people, and from that we developed vision and goals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=287)|
| 0:04:52| and from that we developed some scenarios.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=292)|
| 0:04:54| And the scenarios are alternative visions for our future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=294)|
| 0:04:57| and we went back out to the community in the fall and showed the scenarios| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=297)|
| 0:05:02| and asked people what they liked and didn't like about each one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=302)|
| 0:05:05| And now we have that information that we're going to share with you today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=305)|
| 0:05:09| and then take that and put it into a preferred scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=309)|
| 0:05:14| So, you know, public outreach, as I mentioned, we had two rounds of public outreach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=314)|
| 0:05:18| The first one focused on getting ideas from the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=318)|
| 0:05:21| and the second we gave them choices in terms of alternative scenarios.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=321)|
| 0:05:27| The good news is that we did for the second round of outreach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=327)|
| 0:05:33| we sort of retooled and looked at several different ways of engaging folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=333)|
| 0:05:37| In person is always a great way to engage people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=337)|
| 0:05:40| but we also provided an online tool for people to interact as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=340)|
| 0:05:44| and we got almost 4,000 touches with the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=344)|
| 0:05:48| And for a community of this size, that's outstanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=348)|
| 0:05:51| And that's directly attributed to staff who did an outstanding job of getting the word out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=351)|
| 0:05:55| So really positive feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=355)|
| 0:05:59| So one of the things that we asked people in that outreach, both online and in person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=359)|
| 0:06:03| is, you know, what's important?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=363)|
| 0:06:05| What are your priorities for Knox County in the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=365)|
| 0:06:07| And some things that we heard were we want to see good, sound investment in infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=367)|
| 0:06:13| There are some needs out there that we need to meet from an infrastructure standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=373)|
| 0:06:16| but also, you know, we love Knox County because of the way that it is today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=376)|
| 0:06:22| So we definitely want to see, while we're growing, we want to see a focus on conservation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=382)|
| 0:06:26| and conserving what we love about the county, and community character goes hand in hand with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=386)|
| 0:06:32| And the other thing that we heard is there's really only one kind of housing product in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=392)|
| 0:06:36| and we'd like to see a few more options so that we can attract workforce,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=396)|
| 0:06:40| keep families, young families, all those types of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=400)|
| 0:06:43| So those are some of the things that rose to the top when we, you know, talked to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=403)|
| 0:06:47| We also communicated with them visually, and we showed them different types of communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=407)|
| 0:06:52| And the one that they, again, that they sort of trended towards was the one that provided some different housing products,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=412)|
| 0:06:59| some choice in housing, and maybe introduced a little bit of walkability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=419)|
| 0:07:02| so you could go down and grab a cup of coffee or walk your dog in a neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=422)|
| 0:07:08| Again, you know, in terms of those communities, you know, diverse housing, open space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=428)|
| 0:07:15| people didn't like traffic and overcrowding, as you might think, housing affordability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=435)|
| 0:07:20| and misalignment with infrastructure, things that people told us to avoid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=440)|
| 0:07:25| So we live in a society where everything gets rated either on Google or YouTube or Amazon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=445)|
| 0:07:31| and so we're no different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=451)|
| 0:07:34| We developed three scenarios.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=454)|
| 0:07:37| One was outward bound, which is a continuation of, you know, sort of trend, same housing type,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=457)|
| 0:07:43| but just a lot more of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=463)|
| 0:07:45| Another scenario that said, you know, let's focus on developing some commercial and employment centers around the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=465)|
| 0:07:50| and developing housing options around that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=470)|
| 0:07:52| We called that town and country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=472)|
| 0:07:54| And then the third one focused on redeveloping some of our corridors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=474)|
| 0:07:58| and we called that one on the road again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=478)|
| 0:08:00| You can see that town and country was the overwhelming favorite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=480)|
| 0:08:03| It got, on average, four out of five stars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=483)|
| 0:08:06| And then on the road again was also favorable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=486)|
| 0:08:08| But people pretty consistently rejected the outward bound scenario, as you can see there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=488)|
| 0:08:13| It got the lowest rating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=493)|
| 0:08:14| So they said, no, we want to see something a little different than what we, you know, historically seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=494)|
| 0:08:19| So, you know, we went a little bit more in depth, and we asked people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=499)|
| 0:08:24| what did you like and not like about each scenario?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=504)|
| 0:08:26| And people did like that on the outward bound, people like big yards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=506)|
| 0:08:30| So they liked the fact that they had outdoor space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=510)|
| 0:08:32| and that it would probably be a little more easier to implement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=512)|
| 0:08:35| But they also pointed out that it's sort of a wasteful consumption of land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=515)|
| 0:08:39| that we are concerned about conservation, and this scenario did not pay attention to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=519)|
| 0:08:44| And there really aren't a lot of different types of housing choices in this scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=524)|
| 0:08:50| In town and country, they liked the fact that because of the way that this scenario grows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=530)|
| 0:08:55| that it keeps a lot more areas rural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=535)|
| 0:08:57| So it really plays into that conservation theme, and that it has more jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=537)|
| 0:09:03| and because they're better connected to housing, it could reduce traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=543)|
| 0:09:07| and that it also provides housing choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=547)|
| 0:09:12| They did point out that it seemed like these centers were a little disconnected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=552)|
| 0:09:15| so they'd like to see better connectivity, and it might be a little bit on the dense side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=555)|
| 0:09:21| And then finally on the road again, they really liked the fact that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=561)|
| 0:09:24| they liked some of the same things that they liked about the town and country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=564)|
| 0:09:30| but they also liked the fact that it utilized some of our underutilized quarters and redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=570)|
| 0:09:36| So they really liked that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=576)|
| 0:09:39| So we took that feedback in the last round of output, and this is where we are now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=579)|
| 0:09:44| We're in the process of developing what's called a preferred scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=584)|
| 0:09:47| So we're not going to take those three scenarios that I just described.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=587)|
| 0:09:50| We're not going to take one and say that's our future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=590)|
| 0:09:52| We're actually going to learn from each one and kind of take what we like about each one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=592)|
| 0:09:56| and develop a new scenario that we're calling our preferred scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=596)|
| 0:09:59| So these are the three that we looked at, and from that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=599)|
| 0:10:04| what are the things that we want to, you know, keep?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=604)|
| 0:10:06| What are some things we want to change, and what are the things that we need to confirm?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=606)|
| 0:10:09| And that's what's going to lead to our preferred scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=609)|
| 0:10:11| So I told you that town and country was most popular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=611)|
| 0:10:15| So the first thing we did is what did people really like about that scenario| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=615)|
| 0:10:20| that we want to keep for our future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=620)|
| 0:10:22| So they liked the fact that it had a mix of uses in close proximity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=622)|
| 0:10:25| So putting employment and shopping and those types of things in close distance to housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=625)|
| 0:10:31| they liked that, so let's keep it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=631)|
| 0:10:33| They liked the mix of housing options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=633)|
| 0:10:35| So single family will always be the most popular form of housing in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=635)|
| 0:10:39| but we wanted to see some other options, some multifamily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=639)|
| 0:10:43| but also things like single family attached, what we call the missing middle type of housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=643)|
| 0:10:48| They liked the fact that there were defined community centers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=648)|
| 0:10:51| so we could build a sense of community within the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=651)|
| 0:10:54| And the flip side is because of the way this scenario grows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=654)|
| 0:10:57| we're going to leave a lot of open space, and they like that too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=657)|
| 0:11:00| And then finally, you know, walkable development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=660)|
| 0:11:04| So for people that wanted the choice to be able to go out and do stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=664)|
| 0:11:07| walking from their house, this gives them that option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=667)|
| 0:11:10| But what are some things about the other scenarios that we may want to bring in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=670)|
| 0:11:15| So we looked at our on-the-road-again scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=675)|
| 0:11:18| People really liked the corridor redevelopment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=678)|
| 0:11:20| so we tried to bring some of that into the preferred scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=680)|
| 0:11:24| One of the things that this team has been tasked with is fiscal balance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=684)|
| 0:11:29| and what we mean by fiscal balance is that we want to make sure that our future land use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=689)|
| 0:11:35| brings in just as much or more revenue than it costs to provide services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=695)|
| 0:11:39| and by services we mean picking up the trash, providing water and sewer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=699)|
| 0:11:43| all those types of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=703)|
| 0:11:45| And so the types of things that generate that positive fiscal balance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=705)|
| 0:11:51| or make money are things like shopping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=711)|
| 0:11:53| That's what, you know, people go and they sales tax is what brings in the revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=713)|
| 0:11:57| So we wanted to make sure that we had things like neighborhood town centers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=717)|
| 0:12:01| like quarter commercial that bring in that revenue to counteract some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=721)|
| 0:12:06| residential developments that bring people, which is important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=726)|
| 0:12:09| but they don't necessarily bring revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=729)|
| 0:12:13| We also wanted, you know, one of the things we heard is that the centers weren't well connected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=733)|
| 0:12:17| so we wanted to do a little bit better job of connecting them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=737)|
| 0:12:21| And then there were some things that we wanted to confirm as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=741)|
| 0:12:24| So we've been working with the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=744)|
| 0:12:27| We've been working with the utility providers to make sure that the preferred scenario| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=747)|
| 0:12:30| was in alignment with their plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=750)|
| 0:12:32| We wanted to make sure, you know, I mentioned the fiscal balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=752)|
| 0:12:35| We wanted to make sure that our preferred scenario generates the revenue that it's going to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=755)|
| 0:12:40| you know, that it's going to take to provide services to people in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=760)|
| 0:12:44| We want to make sure that we've got that choice of housing and that we've got those, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=764)|
| 0:12:48| the shopping and employment uses that people said they wanted to see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=768)|
| 0:12:51| but that also the type of growth that we're recommending will ensure that we preserve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=771)|
| 0:12:56| our rural places, but that also put emphasis on new centers and redeveloping the quarters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=776)|
| 0:13:02| So we're in the process of doing that right now is that we're, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=782)|
| 0:13:06| working with the schools, utility providers, with staff, with other stakeholders to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=786)|
| 0:13:12| to confirm that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=792)|
| 0:13:13| So here, this is our draft preferred scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=793)|
| 0:13:15| We're in the process of fine tuning this as we speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=795)|
| 0:13:20| So this is our first draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=800)|
| 0:13:21| We're in the process of developing a second draft that will continue to move us in the direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=801)|
| 0:13:25| that we want to head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=805)|
| 0:13:28| This is our scenario scorecard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=808)|
| 0:13:31| So this is how we look at each scenario compared to each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=811)|
| 0:13:35| So you can see there each dot on that on each one of those little slider bars identifies those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=815)|
| 0:13:41| three scenarios that I told you about at the beginning, outward bound,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=821)|
| 0:13:44| on the road again, and town and country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=824)|
| 0:13:46| And you can see how each one performs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=826)|
| 0:13:48| And so we also plotted the preferred scenario on top of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=828)|
| 0:13:52| And essentially what we wanted to crosscheck is does our preferred scenario get us closer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=832)|
| 0:13:58| to the things that we wanted to see compared to the three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=838)|
| 0:14:02| And we think we're getting there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=842)|
| 0:14:04| We think that we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=844)|
| 0:14:05| So, for example, you know, we said that conservation is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=845)|
| 0:14:09| So we wanted to make sure that our preferred scenario was optimizing the amount of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=849)|
| 0:14:13| conservation in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=853)|
| 0:14:14| And we think that we're getting there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=854)|
| 0:14:16| Choice of housing is, you know, is another one of those things that we want to make sure that we're,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=856)|
| 0:14:20| you know, that we're getting there, that we're providing better connectivity between origins| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=860)|
| 0:14:24| and destinations to improve transportation outcomes, all those types of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=864)|
| 0:14:29| So you can see that's where we are on the scenario scorecard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=869)|
| 0:14:33| We're continuing to refine our preferred scenario to get us in a better position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=873)|
| 0:14:37| But that's sort of where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=877)|
| 0:14:39| And then the last thing that I, you know, I talked about fiscal impact a couple of times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=879)|
| 0:14:45| And so we have a tool that will help us estimate or ballpark what we think the fiscal impact will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=885)|
| 0:14:52| under different scenarios.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=892)|
| 0:14:54| So what we've determined is if we continue to do what we're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=894)|
| 0:14:58| which is primarily emphasize single-family housing, which is important for sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=898)|
| 0:15:03| but it doesn't generate revenue, if we continue to do that and don't look at other types of uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=903)|
| 0:15:08| by 2045 we're probably going to run about a $2 million annual deficit fiscally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=908)|
| 0:15:14| In contrast, our preferred scenario where we identify, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=914)|
| 0:15:18| bring in things like employment and shopping opportunities into the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=918)|
| 0:15:22| it's going to generate tax revenue that we think that we can get close to a $1 million surplus annually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=922)|
| 0:15:27| if we do that according to the preferred scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=927)|
| 0:15:30| So that's the direction we definitely want to head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=930)|
| 0:15:34| So we have a couple of committees that we're working with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=934)|
| 0:15:38| One is a technical stakeholder committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=938)|
| 0:15:41| The other is a public stakeholder committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=941)|
| 0:15:44| And they're helping us refine the preferred scenario,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=944)|
| 0:15:47| and that's how we ask them a series of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=947)|
| 0:15:50| We've had meetings with them over the last couple of months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=950)|
| 0:15:53| and they've helped us refine the scenarios.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=953)|
| 0:15:56| And so that's what we're in the process of doing right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=956)|
| 0:15:59| So once we get the preferred scenario nailed down, where do we go from here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=959)|
| 0:16:04| This is, you know, this is probably the most important part of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=964)|
| 0:16:08| This is where we develop policy and recommendations that we're all going to have to abide by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=968)|
| 0:16:13| and live by into the, you know, near future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=973)|
| 0:16:16| And that's specifically going to be the future land use map and transportation recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=976)|
| 0:16:20| So that's where we're going next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=980)|
| 0:16:22| Once we're all in agreement on that preferred scenario,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=982)|
| 0:16:25| we're going to translate it into a future land use map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=985)|
| 0:16:28| And that's what's going to be policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=988)|
| 0:16:30| That's what we're going to follow into the future, which is obviously important to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=990)|
| 0:16:34| So that's where we're going from here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=994)|
| 0:16:37| So, as I said, this month we're going to wrap up that preferred scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=997)|
| 0:16:42| We're going to get it in a great spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1002)|
| 0:16:44| And then we're going to shift gears in February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1004)|
| 0:16:46| We're going to create that future land use map and policy recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1006)|
| 0:16:51| We're also going to create transportation recommendations for Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1011)|
| 0:16:55| And then we're going to go back out to the public in the spring and say, hey, guys, we did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1015)|
| 0:17:00| Here is what the plan looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1020)|
| 0:17:02| Thank you all for your participation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1022)|
| 0:17:04| We all, you know, developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1024)|
| 0:17:06| We think a future that is better than what we would have otherwise done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1026)|
| 0:17:10| So that's the direction that we're going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1030)|
| 0:17:12| We're sort of coming into the home stretch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1032)|
| 0:17:14| It's sort of exciting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1034)|
| 0:17:15| We're definitely looking forward to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1035)|
| 0:17:17| So with that, I think I did okay on time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1037)|
| 0:17:20| I'm going to stop and see if anyone has any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1040)|
| 0:17:29| Just a couple of things, and I think this would be helpful as we go into this next community feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1049)|
| 0:17:36| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1056)|
| 0:17:37| I'd love to see kind of an overlay of where, if we have it by zip code, like where the feedback so far has come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1057)|
| 0:17:44| Because while almost 4,000 is great, that's still less than 1% of the county population that's been involved of giving some type of feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1064)|
| 0:17:53| So, one, I'd like to make sure that we're reaching all parts of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1073)|
| 0:17:56| It's not coming from, like, just clusters that may be, you know, within the city that may have more access to some of the emails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1076)|
| 0:18:02| and things that we're getting out into the rural parts as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1082)|
| 0:18:06| So, and then I'd love to just see some of the data behind how you all did the calculation on the status quo| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1086)|
| 0:18:13| and the deficit versus the possible surplus and how that's broken down in city versus county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1093)|
| 0:18:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1099)|
| 0:18:21| So, yes, we can track where we're getting the feedback from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1101)|
| 0:18:24| I think that's one of the questions that we ask when we do online and in person, so we can track that geographically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1104)|
| 0:18:30| and we'll have the technical documentation on the fiscal impact as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1110)|
| 0:18:34| So, yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1114)|
| 0:18:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1115)|
| 0:18:36| Then I had a couple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1116)|
| 0:18:38| As far as the policy portion of the recommendations after the land use map is created,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1118)|
| 0:18:45| I'm assuming that staff is going to work with them on identifying what's going on with the layers that we currently have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1125)|
| 0:18:52| with the general plan, the sector plans, and all those sorts of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1132)|
| 0:18:55| and are we going to do one plan instead of multiple plans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1135)|
| 0:18:57| How is it going to layer in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1137)|
| 0:18:59| When the recommended updates would be and that sort of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1139)|
| 0:19:02| and I'd like to make sure that we include all that as a part of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1142)|
| 0:19:08| Yeah, it will definitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1148)|
| 0:19:09| I mean, there will be, before the general plan, the advanced NOx is approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1149)|
| 0:19:14| there's going to be the mayor will call the Urban Growth Boundary Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1154)|
| 0:19:20| and that will be discussed, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1160)|
| 0:19:22| And then once that is defined, then the general plan will be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1162)|
| 0:19:27| And our goal was to have, I think the county's goal is to have a general plan that is updated every five years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1167)|
| 0:19:34| and move away from a variety of sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1174)|
| 0:19:38| That is the goal that we had going into this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1178)|
| 0:19:42| And then I'm assuming in March, April,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1182)|
| 0:19:46| we would be coming through Planning Commission and County Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1186)|
| 0:19:49| and these will be adopted through meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1189)|
| 0:19:53| It's not going to be just, hey, this is what we've done, and this is what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1193)|
| 0:19:56| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1196)|
| 0:19:57| If I recall, and Jim can chime in to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1197)|
| 0:19:59| this will not be adopted until after the Urban Growth Policy Committee looks at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1199)|
| 0:20:04| and sets the boundaries, unless that changes state law, which who knows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1204)|
| 0:20:09| it might be a change in state law that may not have to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1209)|
| 0:20:12| but that the Urban Growth Policy Committee will set the boundaries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1212)|
| 0:20:16| and then you'll come to the Planning Commission with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1216)|
| 0:20:20| and the general plan to be adopted after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1220)|
| 0:20:24| So we don't want to adopt anything before the Urban Growth Policy Committee meets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1224)|
| 0:20:31| And then I guess what I would further recommend to this group is we did get an email with this package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1231)|
| 0:20:38| Yes, from Dory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1238)|
| 0:20:39| So I would strongly urge all the commissioners to go back and look at that email,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1239)|
| 0:20:45| look at that PowerPoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1245)|
| 0:20:47| Is this a smaller version of the package that we all got?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1247)|
| 0:20:53| I believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1253)|
| 0:20:54| We sent out the full version last night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1254)|
| 0:20:58| I think it's the same one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1258)|
| 0:20:59| It's the same one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1259)|
| 0:21:00| Oh, it's the same one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1260)|
| 0:21:01| I just talked really fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1261)|
| 0:21:02| It's the same one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1262)|
| 0:21:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1263)|
| 0:21:04| So not to cut the conversation off today, if we have questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1264)|
| 0:21:08| I want to keep the conversation going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1268)|
| 0:21:09| but I would just encourage everybody, if they do have individual questions with staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1269)|
| 0:21:13| as we're going through these next processes, to send those in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1273)|
| 0:21:17| and maybe we can just run a sheet of questions that have come in from the commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1277)|
| 0:21:24| and keep track of that as we're going through this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1284)|
| 0:21:28| where we can come back if we have to have further discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1288)|
| 0:21:33| That way it's not tying up this meeting or the planning commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1293)|
| 0:21:39| We can track them if we get them individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1299)|
| 0:21:43| Question for Kevin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1303)|
| 0:21:44| Is the capital improvement plan part of the comprehensive or master plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1304)|
| 0:21:49| or is that a whole separate document at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1309)|
| 0:21:54| It is, and I'll defer to Jim on this, but this will most definitely inform the CIP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1314)|
| 0:22:00| but it won't be the CIP in and of itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1320)|
| 0:22:04| But, yeah, we'll be making recommendations that will absolutely inform the CIP, for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1324)|
| 0:22:09| Did I accurately represent that, Jim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1329)|
| 0:22:12| Yeah, I guess my question to Jim is, you know, is the county proceeding to go with the CIP?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1332)|
| 0:22:18| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1338)|
| 0:22:19| Yeah, what we currently do is we have a year-to-year capital plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1339)|
| 0:22:23| What we hope to proceed out of this is more of a, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1343)|
| 0:22:27| a three- to five-year capital plan that really identifies the capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1347)|
| 0:22:31| and safety needs that we have in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1351)|
| 0:22:33| rather than kind of what we have done in the past is more of a proactive year-to-year approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1353)|
| 0:22:41| One final thought, and, Jim, this is more for you and Jeff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1361)|
| 0:22:46| You know, a couple of months ago you all showed us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1366)|
| 0:22:49| when we were looking at the North Shore corridor, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1369)|
| 0:22:54| how it's currently graded, what it looks like in the future and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1374)|
| 0:22:58| I think it would be helpful if we had something that overlaid this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1378)|
| 0:23:01| when it was all said and done for the entire county, the major corridors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1381)|
| 0:23:07| of how they're graded, what we project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1387)|
| 0:23:09| That way, because one of the things that I've known for years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1389)|
| 0:23:14| individual communities care about where they live,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1394)|
| 0:23:16| but they don't always see the master plan of what's happening county-wide, community-wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1396)|
| 0:23:23| But if they see, hey, this is happening here because if we don't fix this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1403)|
| 0:23:26| it's going to cause problems here later on, us fixing it here if we don't fix it upstream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1406)|
| 0:23:31| So I think the community having those resources and something that we can kind of keep up to date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1411)|
| 0:23:36| so that they can see, right now this section is graded as an F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1416)|
| 0:23:40| We do these road improvements over the next two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1420)|
| 0:23:42| and all of a sudden it flips to an A, which then fixes things upstream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1422)|
| 0:23:46| It might stop us from having to spend money where a community thinks it needs to be spent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1426)|
| 0:23:51| because we're spending it right in the right place to fix something that's causing problems downstream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1431)|
| 0:23:56| So just something to think about that I think would help the community as we move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1436)|
| 0:24:00| is just some type of thing on our website where we have kind of that transportation overlay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1440)|
| 0:24:05| with the major corridors so they know how all these developments and stuff are starting to impact movement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1445)|
| 0:24:10| and where you all are having to invest and put some things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1450)|
| 0:24:16| Yeah, we'll consider that going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1456)|
| 0:24:18| Karen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1458)|
| 0:24:20| This is for you and anyone else who has been a part of the planning department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1460)|
| 0:24:27| for longer than a lot of the commissioners have been serving as commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1467)|
| 0:24:32| because I know during my experience the sector plan amendments, general plan amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1472)|
| 0:24:40| the amendment process has been a standard part of what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1480)|
| 0:24:45| And with this, this is kind of tagging onto Chris's comment, we shouldn't be seeing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1485)|
| 0:24:50| We should see a general plan that has provided guidance there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1490)|
| 0:24:55| so that we're not seeing the number of amendments that we have become accustomed to seeing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1495)|
| 0:25:00| My question is, and if you can do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1500)|
| 0:25:05| what percentage or frequency of amendments would be normal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1505)|
| 0:25:13| when you've got a plan that is in place that has been adopted and endorsed and is being followed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1513)|
| 0:25:25| That's assuming we don't make any mistakes or errors, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1525)|
| 0:25:31| I really don't have a good guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1531)|
| 0:25:33| I would say none would be ideal, but market changes, conditions change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1533)|
| 0:25:40| investments, capital investments change via, i.e., from the state or the county or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1540)|
| 0:25:45| a new school maybe pop up in some place where we hadn't anticipated perhaps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1545)|
| 0:25:51| and that will cause attractors or investment from an industry or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1551)|
| 0:25:57| Those things we cannot anticipate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1557)|
| 0:25:59| So we would hope that they're not on a monthly basis or a quarterly basis like we are treating them now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1559)|
| 0:26:05| but it would be more once a year or something we'd better do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1565)|
| 0:26:09| So, Kevin, that would be a question that's a very good one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1569)|
| 0:26:13| So we just came through a recode process in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1573)|
| 0:26:17| and there were some unintended consequences that came out of that by just not being able to capture everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1577)|
| 0:26:26| So that's why I was curious about the layers of the plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1586)|
| 0:26:30| Is that general plan going to be granular enough to give us enough advice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1590)|
| 0:26:36| and a roadmap to deal with certain areas, as Eddie said, that may be more intense than others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1596)|
| 0:26:44| or are we going to need extra layers under this new general plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1604)|
| 0:26:50| And then what is your experience as to the frequency of update?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1610)|
| 0:26:55| Do you need to go back a year later and review what's done after there's been some implementation time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1615)|
| 0:27:01| That's some things that we've experienced with some other updates, I think, is the reason for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1621)|
| 0:27:07| Yep, that's a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1627)|
| 0:27:09| So this is the preferred scenario map that I showed you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1629)|
| 0:27:11| and our goal is to take this information and develop a future land use map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1631)|
| 0:27:17| Our goal is to get to a greater level of specificity than what you're seeing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1637)|
| 0:27:21| This is very conceptual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1641)|
| 0:27:22| We're not going to get necessarily to the individual parcel level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1642)|
| 0:27:26| but we are going to give you enough specificity to be able to make informed decisions moving forward as a board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1646)|
| 0:27:33| And in terms of the regularity, Jeff, you said a year, once a year for an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1653)|
| 0:27:39| I think that's probably a good rule of thumb,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1659)|
| 0:27:41| and if you find that you have to come back and do that more often,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1661)|
| 0:27:45| then that would indicate that the plan is probably not in alignment with our intentions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1665)|
| 0:27:50| That's our goal is that you don't have to come back and amend on a regular basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1670)|
| 0:27:55| that it's only about once a year or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1675)|
| 0:27:57| And then probably, as Jeff mentioned, I mean things change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1677)|
| 0:28:00| We don't have a crystal ball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1680)|
| 0:28:02| We can't anticipate what's going to happen in five years, pandemic, market downturn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1682)|
| 0:28:06| wherever that might be, so that you do have to update your plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1686)|
| 0:28:09| but it shouldn't be more than every five years or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1689)|
| 0:28:13| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1693)|
| 0:28:18| Kevin, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1698)|
| 0:28:19| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1699)|
| 0:28:22| Okay, next on the agenda is a discussion item surrounding density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1702)|
| 0:28:27| and the rural residential land use classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1707)|
| 0:28:30| Mike?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1710)|
| 0:28:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1714)|
| 0:28:36| I'm going to try to make this brief,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1716)|
| 0:28:38| but I just want to introduce this to you all as a discussion item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1718)|
| 0:28:45| because it has been coming up in the last few months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1725)|
| 0:28:50| Rural residential land use is kind of the way it sounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1730)|
| 0:28:55| It's supposed to be in a rural area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1735)|
| 0:28:59| and currently we have inconsistencies between different sector plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1739)|
| 0:29:02| on what the rural residential land use says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1742)|
| 0:29:05| particularly in regard to density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1745)|
| 0:29:08| And really, since 2016, we amended the land use table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1748)|
| 0:29:14| but only two sector plans have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1754)|
| 0:29:16| It's the southwest county and the northwest county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1756)|
| 0:29:19| And what the rural residential land use classification is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1759)|
| 0:29:24| basically, ag, agricultural zoning, PR zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1764)|
| 0:29:27| and technically a couple of others, open space zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1767)|
| 0:29:30| and there may be one more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1770)|
| 0:29:32| But for the PR zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1772)|
| 0:29:35| it says that the density would be consistent with the growth policy plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1775)|
| 0:29:38| and the growth policy plan allows consideration of two dwellings per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1778)|
| 0:29:42| and the density would be consistent with the growth policy plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1782)|
| 0:29:45| and the growth policy plan allows consideration of two dwellings per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1785)|
| 0:29:49| and the growth policy plan allows consideration of two dwellings per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1789)|
| 0:29:53| or potentially up to three dwellings per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1793)|
| 0:29:57| Every sector plan before 2016 has a density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1797)|
| 0:30:04| or maximum density in the rural residential of one dwelling unit per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1804)|
| 0:30:07| stated in the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1807)|
| 0:30:09| As staff, we've been defaulting back to the growth policy plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1809)|
| 0:30:14| when it comes to the rural residential density recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1814)|
| 0:30:18| So you might see, if you looked in the sector plan itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1818)|
| 0:30:23| you would see that the rural residential says one dwelling unit per acre max| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1823)|
| 0:30:26| in some of these areas, but in reality,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1826)|
| 0:30:29| the growth policy plan really is what needs to trump here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1829)|
| 0:30:35| There's an ag land use which still says one dwelling unit per acre max,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1835)|
| 0:30:39| but there's no in-between right now between ag and low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1839)|
| 0:30:45| It's either one dwelling unit per acre in the ag in the rural residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1845)|
| 0:30:49| or you flip to five dwelling unit per acre in the low-density residential land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1849)|
| 0:30:54| So it's really important to have that in-between land use classification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1854)|
| 0:30:58| like rural residential that can fill that gap,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1858)|
| 0:31:01| and we aren't unnecessarily extending low-density residential into rural areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1861)|
| 0:31:09| I've already kind of explained it, but this is the land use table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1869)|
| 0:31:12| that is the pre-2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1872)|
| 0:31:17| You see the ag and the rural residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1877)|
| 0:31:21| There's a lot of text there, but both of them say maximum one dwelling unit per acre in the PR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1881)|
| 0:31:27| In the new land use classification table that we've been using since 2016,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1887)|
| 0:31:32| there is a difference there where the PR can go up to three dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1892)|
| 0:31:37| as long as it's consistent with the growth policy plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1897)|
| 0:31:39| or which is consistent with the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1899)|
| 0:31:45| So we just wanted to let you know why we're recommending more than one dwelling unit per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1905)|
| 0:31:50| in some of these instances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1910)|
| 0:31:53| and we'll also be providing this information to county commissions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1913)|
| 0:31:57| so that they're aware of why we're recommending more than one dwelling unit per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1917)|
| 0:32:02| in the rural residential land use classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1922)|
| 0:32:10| Just be aware that it's a case-by-case basis, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1930)|
| 0:32:14| and that you always have the staff recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1934)|
| 0:32:18| and county commission can trump your recommendations, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1938)|
| 0:32:21| So just sort of that policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1941)|
| 0:32:23| We want to try to be consistent from a staff policy perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1943)|
| 0:32:28| Yeah, obviously somebody's not guaranteed a land use plan change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1948)|
| 0:32:32| a sector plan amendment either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1952)|
| 0:32:33| So in most cases, somebody's going from ag to rural residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1953)|
| 0:32:38| The ag already allows one dwelling unit per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1958)|
| 0:32:41| If they're going to rural residential, then by our interpretation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1961)|
| 0:32:45| they would be able to get a little bit more density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1965)|
| 0:32:48| So if there was no desire to change or increase the density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1968)|
| 0:32:52| then they could just say ag and one dwelling unit per acre would be the max.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1972)|
| 0:32:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1979)|
| 0:33:01| Anything on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1981)|
| 0:33:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=1984)|

| 0:34:15| The existing sector plan and the one-year plan for this area shows it as office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2055)|
| 0:34:20| Office as a sector plan classification doesn't recommend commercial districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2060)|
| 0:34:27| so a sector plan would be required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2067)|
| 0:34:32| And you can also see the floodplain in this area that is on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2072)|
| 0:34:40| This is the one-year plan, so you can clearly see where the city limits versus the county are in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2080)|
| 0:34:50| And the subject property is served by a CAT line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2090)|
| 0:34:54| so Route 16 runs along Cross Park Drive and Cross Creek Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2094)|
| 0:35:04| And this is zoomed in on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2104)|
| 0:35:06| The applicant is requesting to retain the O zoning and the O land use classification in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2106)|
| 0:35:15| It's our understanding that they would like to maybe do some sort of residential at that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2115)|
| 0:35:24| In 2015, the city upgraded the stormwater system along Cross Park Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2124)|
| 0:35:31| It's a fairly large system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2131)|
| 0:35:33| The original alignment included a ditch that bisected the subject property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2133)|
| 0:35:38| as indicated in the light blue line that you see here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2138)|
| 0:35:43| So by 2015, they had moved the stormwater ditch to this location along Cross Park Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2143)|
| 0:35:51| And this is what it looked like in 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2151)|
| 0:35:59| So staff is recommending a one-year plan amendment to the community commercial land use district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2159)|
| 0:36:09| and the stream protection area for a portion of this parcel as requested by the applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2169)|
| 0:36:17| because it's consistent with the location criteria for community commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2177)|
| 0:36:22| which talks about it needing to be located at the intersection of arterial streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2182)|
| 0:36:28| and that it should be relatively flat areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2188)|
| 0:36:30| and there should be vehicular and pedestrian connections accommodated between the various land uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2190)|
| 0:36:37| And I would also argue that when there is a larger comprehensive update to the land use plan for this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2197)|
| 0:36:44| that community commercial should be considered for this entire office area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2204)|
| 0:36:49| because of the predominance of the existing commercial zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2209)|
| 0:36:55| and the zone districts that are permitted in community commercial include office, CN, CG, and CH zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2215)|
| 0:37:06| However, staff does have a minor modification that we are requested for the rezoning in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2226)|
| 0:37:14| Because there is office zoning along this back portion here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2234)|
| 0:37:18| which provides a transition between the adjacent single family residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2238)|
| 0:37:23| staff's proposing to extend this line for the rezoning all the way across| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2243)|
| 0:37:29| so this entire section would remain office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2249)|
| 0:37:33| and retain that buffer zone or that transitional area between the commercial zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2253)|
| 0:37:38| and the single family residential neighborhood next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2258)|
| 0:37:43| Are there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2263)|
| 0:37:45| Yeah, Liz, is that, I'm looking back there, looks like some condos and such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2265)|
| 0:37:50| Are you talking about where the creek is or are you talking about the back of the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2270)|
| 0:37:55| So this is the area that they have requested for the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2275)|
| 0:38:00| Gotcha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2280)|
| 0:38:01| And this is what we're recommending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2281)|
| 0:38:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2283)|
| 0:38:04| So you can see there's still some adjacency to this residential area back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2284)|
| 0:38:09| So we're recommending to extend that all the way across.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2289)|
| 0:38:12| Got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2292)|
| 0:38:16| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2296)|
| 0:38:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2301)|
| 0:38:22| Shall we move on to number 20?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2302)|
| 0:38:25| The next four you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2305)|
| 0:38:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2306)|
| 0:38:29| The subject property is an approximate five-acre site consisting of two parcels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2309)|
| 0:38:34| at the end of Clayberry Drive in the Carnes community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2314)|
| 0:38:38| This area is north of the commercial corridor along Oak Ridge Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2318)|
| 0:38:44| In the zoning map, you can see that this is Clayberry Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2324)|
| 0:38:48| Let me turn this thing on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2328)|
| 0:38:50| Clayberry Drive here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2330)|
| 0:38:51| So this is their primary access currently into this ag-zoned area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2331)|
| 0:38:58| The single-family residential neighborhood is also adjacent to planned residential zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2338)|
| 0:39:05| up to eight dwelling units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2345)|
| 0:39:07| and then there are some higher planned residential zone districts that have also happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2347)|
| 0:39:13| However, these have direct access to Oak Ridge Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2353)|
| 0:39:19| There's another adjacent planned residential area that has access to Harrell Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2359)|
| 0:39:25| So the applicant is asking to go to planned residential up to 12 dwelling units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2365)|
| 0:39:34| and staff, although we can consider up to 12 dwelling units an acre because of the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2374)|
| 0:39:42| designation for this area shown as MDR to support the adjacent commercial land uses in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2382)|
| 0:39:50| staff's recommending up to eight dwelling units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2390)|
| 0:39:53| which is consistent with the other planned residential zoning that has happened in this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2393)|
| 0:39:58| that doesn't have frontage on Oak Ridge Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2398)|
| 0:40:03| You can see the bird's-eye view of this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2403)|
| 0:40:08| So you can see this adjacent subdivision where the only access point for that rezoning would be here currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2408)|
| 0:40:19| It does not have access through these adjacent higher density-zoned areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2419)|
| 0:40:29| And again, just reiterating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2429)|
| 0:40:31| this is what our staff recommendation is to approve PR up to eight DU per acre because it's consistent with the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2431)|
| 0:40:37| and consistent with the surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2437)|
| 0:40:41| Are there questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2441)|
| 0:40:47| Next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2447)|
| 0:40:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2448)|
| 0:40:50| So moving on, this is item number 24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2450)|
| 0:40:54| This is in South Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2454)|
| 0:40:56| This is the south side of West Governor John Sevier Highway, east side of Maryville Pike, north side of Crenshaw Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2456)|
| 0:41:05| This is a Weigel's gas station, I believe, at this location here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2465)|
| 0:41:10| There is a bridge that travels over Maryville Pike at this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2470)|
| 0:41:15| So a portion of this property sort of sits below the grade of John Sevier Highway in this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2475)|
| 0:41:23| and has frontage more along Maryville Pike and Crenshaw Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2483)|
| 0:41:28| It's a 4.3-acre area currently zoned CA and A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2488)|
| 0:41:33| And the applicant is asking to rezone planned residential up to 12 dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2493)|
| 0:41:40| And that also requires a sector plan amendment to medium-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2500)|
| 0:41:48| The sector plan for this area shows this node as neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2508)|
| 0:41:53| And the applicant, again, is asking to modify this to medium-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2513)|
| 0:41:59| Sort of catty corner from this area here that you see hatched in pink and orange is medium-density residential slash office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2519)|
| 0:42:16| So staff is recommending to change the sector plan to MDR and rezone to PR up to eight dwelling units an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2536)|
| 0:42:26| because it is a transitional land use zone between the existing commercial node and the adjacent single-family residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2546)|
| 0:42:36| Because it's along the John Sevier Highway, we're also recommending two conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2556)|
| 0:42:40| one of which is to maintain the tree buffer with 50-foot depth along John Sevier Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2560)|
| 0:42:48| since this is a forested parcel as we have with other rezonings that have occurred along this corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2568)|
| 0:42:56| as recommended by the John Sevier Highway Scenic Corridor Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2576)|
| 0:43:02| And we're also recommending, because it's currently vegetated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2582)|
| 0:43:07| that no clearing or grading of the site shall be permitted until a concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2587)|
| 0:43:11| or use on review development plan is provided to the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2591)|
| 0:43:18| Liz, I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2598)|
| 0:43:20| You may have, with the second condition, that may take care of my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2600)|
| 0:43:24| But the 50-foot buffer for John Sevier Highway, is that required to be the existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2604)|
| 0:43:36| Since it is a forested parcel, does it require that that is the buffer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2616)|
| 0:43:41| Or is the applicant able to raise that and then plant new buffer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2621)|
| 0:43:47| The way it's written currently, they would typically limit the clearing to that 50-foot area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2627)|
| 0:43:56| and retain their vegetation there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2636)|
| 0:43:58| They don't really have a lot of access to John Sevier Highway at that location because of the change in the grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2638)|
| 0:44:05| So, you know, I don't think that will pose a major concern for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2645)|
| 0:44:10| They'll likely have to access on Maryville Pike or Crenshaw Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2650)|
| 0:44:16| And this area over here that you can see is zoned planned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2656)|
| 0:44:22| So there is some existing vacant commercial zoning in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2662)|
| 0:44:26| So the addition of residential density in and around this commercial node, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2666)|
| 0:44:32| may help support some of the existing commercial zoning that's out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2672)|
| 0:44:43| Thanks for letting me cogitate to get my next question out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2683)|
| 0:44:46| The concept plan that would be provided, that is where there would be any indication of signaling or change on the roadway, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2686)|
| 0:45:00| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2700)|
| 0:45:01| And they most likely would probably have to, I don't know how many acres this was again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2701)|
| 0:45:07| How many acres?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2707)|
| 0:45:09| 4.3 acres, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2709)|
| 0:45:13| So I don't know that it would trigger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2713)|
| 0:45:15| It probably wouldn't trigger a traffic impacts study, but they would have to meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2715)|
| 0:45:20| Yeah, the concept would come through in site distance and that would be assessed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2720)|
| 0:45:23| So they would have to, if they have access to Maryville Pike, they'll have to work with TDOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2723)|
| 0:45:28| As a point of information too, there are also some safety improvements that are proposed for this section of John Sevier Highway in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2728)|
| 0:45:36| I'm not sure what the timeline is on that, but there, you know, there is some acknowledgement of the safety concerns in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2736)|
| 0:45:49| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2749)|
| 0:45:52| Questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2752)|
| 0:45:53| Next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2753)|
| 0:45:54| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2754)|
| 0:45:57| This next item, we are just updating you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2757)|
| 0:46:00| It's item number 41, 1A23UR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2760)|
| 0:46:03| This is the west side of French Road, west of East Governor John Sevier Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2763)|
| 0:46:10| And you've received quite a few community comments regarding this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2770)|
| 0:46:15| And we actually just spoke to the Applicant's Council right before this agenda review began.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2775)|
| 0:46:24| And they are supporting the staff recommendation to postpone this item for 30 days until the February 12th Planning Commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2784)|
| 0:46:35| We had outstanding questions when we were reviewing this item regarding applicable noise ordinances within the Knox County Code of Ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2795)|
| 0:46:44| some of which may exist outside of the Zoning Ordinance and more in the Building Codes section of the Code of Ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2804)|
| 0:46:54| as well as possible platting requirements that may be required under the Tennessee Code annotated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2814)|
| 0:47:01| So we reached out to the Knox County Law Director's Office regarding those questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2821)|
| 0:47:06| And we feel that within, you know, this 30-day time period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2826)|
| 0:47:10| hopefully we'll have a better understanding of the applicable ordinances to this type of use in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2830)|
| 0:47:18| And just as a point of information, we have not reviewed an outdoor rifle range as a use on review anywhere in the county to my knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2838)|
| 0:47:27| So this is a first of its kind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2847)|
| 0:47:30| So will this go on automatic postponement now? Or will we have to hear it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2850)|
| 0:47:35| I don't think so. I think there will have to be a motion made since the agenda has already been finalized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2855)|
| 0:47:47| Okay. Next round is item number six. And Jesse is going to take these next two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2867)|
| 0:48:11| Okay. So item number six, 1A23RZ and 1A23PA and 1A23SP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2891)|
| 0:48:20| This is just waiting for the screen to show up. There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2900)|
| 0:48:28| So this property is a half acre parcel with a single family detached dwelling on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2908)|
| 0:48:33| It's on a substandard local street, very narrow, that accesses Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2913)|
| 0:48:40| The applicant is requesting to rezone from RN1, single family residential neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2920)|
| 0:48:45| with the hillside protection overlay to office and the hillside protection would be retained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2925)|
| 0:48:51| The plan amendment for the one year plan in the sector plan would be to go from low density residential to office and hillside protection would be retained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2931)|
| 0:49:03| As you can see in the zoning map, there is office zoning adjacent to the south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2943)|
| 0:49:09| However, that parcel does have two access points, one of which is on Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2949)|
| 0:49:15| And extending office zoning north would be a bit of an encroachment into the south Woodlawn neighborhood of which this property is a part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2955)|
| 0:49:23| potentially bringing additional traffic onto this very narrow part of Stonewall Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2963)|
| 0:49:32| The sector plan and the one year plan show this as LDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2972)|
| 0:49:36| And we find that the property does not meet the criteria for a plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2976)|
| 0:49:45| There have been no changes of conditions, no new roads or utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2985)|
| 0:49:49| It's not the result of an error in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2989)|
| 0:49:52| There are no trends in development population or traffic pointing to office uses here and no changes in public policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=2992)|
| 0:50:02| In the aerial, you can see that this is a wooded established residential neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3002)|
| 0:50:07| The subject property is located near a gateway sign for the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3007)|
| 0:50:16| That gateway sign is right here, says welcome to the south Woodlawn neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3016)|
| 0:50:20| And there's the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3020)|
| 0:50:25| So our recommendation is to deny office zoning and land use classifications because it encroaches into an established residential neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3025)|
| 0:50:34| And it does not meet any of the conditions warranting a change to the land use plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3034)|
| 0:50:39| Some additional rationale is this neighborhood was established around the 1940s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3039)|
| 0:50:44| It has a well-defined boundary with its signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3044)|
| 0:50:48| It conflicts with the general plan policy to protect neighborhoods from encroaching commercial development or other incompatible uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3048)|
| 0:50:56| And some of the uses permitted with office zoning at this entrance location could potentially be damaging to the character of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3056)|
| 0:51:04| Some office uses permitted by right include a drug treatment clinic, a broadcasting facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3064)|
| 0:51:10| You could potentially demolish the existing home and install six or seven townhomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3070)|
| 0:51:14| And I will say it may not appear it on this street view here, but when I was driving there to put up the signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3074)|
| 0:51:21| I felt that if another car was coming, I would need to veer off the road a bit to make room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3081)|
| 0:51:26| It is very narrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3086)|
| 0:51:28| Happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3088)|
| 0:51:38| OK, moving along to item number 30, 1W23RZ, 1J23SP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3098)|
| 0:51:44| This is a county application in the rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3104)|
| 0:51:48| The applicant is requesting to go from agricultural to planned residential up to three dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3108)|
| 0:51:54| And a plan amendment would be from agricultural and hillside protection and stream protection to rural residential hillside protection and stream protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3114)|
| 0:52:05| The stream protection is barely encroaching into this property boundary because it is near the Clinch River to the north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3125)|
| 0:52:16| This property has two access points to West Emory Road, which is a minor collector leading to Oak Ridge Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3136)|
| 0:52:24| which is an arterial street in the planned growth boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3144)|
| 0:52:29| So in the zoning, you can see that it's agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3149)|
| 0:52:32| However, there is planned residential zoning up to the requested density on the opposite end of West Emory Road here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3152)|
| 0:52:41| This is also at a density of three dwelling units an acre and you have general residential as well in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3161)|
| 0:52:53| The sector plan does show that the majority of this parcel is in the hillside protection area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3173)|
| 0:53:00| And there is rural residential in the area as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3180)|
| 0:53:07| You can see rural residential here along the south and there is rural residential here as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3187)|
| 0:53:13| And in Anderson County over here, there's rural residential here or equivalent to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3193)|
| 0:53:22| In the area, you can see that much of this property is wooded, especially along the rear property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3202)|
| 0:53:29| Looking at historical aerials from 1950s, it does appear that much of this southern portion was previously disturbed for agricultural purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3209)|
| 0:53:43| So our recommendation is to approve rural residential and planned residential up to three dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3223)|
| 0:53:49| on the condition that the undisturbed slopes of the copper ridge along the rear as identified in this area here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3229)|
| 0:53:59| They have a slope of 25 percent or more. It is undisturbed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3239)|
| 0:54:04| And so the condition would be that that remain undisturbed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3244)|
| 0:54:12| So the reason for recommending approval of rural residential is it is characteristic of development trends in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3252)|
| 0:54:18| And it is a common designation in this rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3258)|
| 0:54:23| The planned residential up to three does meet the growth policy plan criteria for considering that density because it would be PR zoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3263)|
| 0:54:32| Public water and sewer is available in the general area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3272)|
| 0:54:36| So it's hard to see here, but there's sewer adjacent here, over here and down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3276)|
| 0:54:42| So from three directions, the West Emory Road would be connecting a collector street to an arterial street in the planned growth boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3282)|
| 0:54:55| That's Oak Ridge Highway. So that meets the criteria there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3295)|
| 0:54:59| And then the traffic impact study that was conducted shows that it is not unreasonably impair traffic flow along the arterials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3299)|
| 0:55:08| Page 12 and 13 of that study that was included in your packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3308)|
| 0:55:12| Sorry for that long report. The zoning condition would leave the copper ridge undisturbed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3312)|
| 0:55:18| This is supported by three development policies in the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3318)|
| 0:55:21| Policy 10.4 to rigorously enforce zoning regulations and conditions of approval to maintain public confidence in the planned development process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3321)|
| 0:55:30| which supports conditions specifically on planned development zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3330)|
| 0:55:36| Policy 9.2 encourages development practices that respect and fit the natural landscape, minimize the loss of trees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3336)|
| 0:55:42| woodlands, and wildlife habitat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3342)|
| 0:55:44| And general policy 9.4 provides incentives for conservation subdivisions to set aside large portions of open space to protect natural resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3344)|
| 0:55:54| So granting the requested density with this condition encourages utilization of planned residential's development flexibility as it was intended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3354)|
| 0:56:02| Happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3362)|
| 0:56:05| Yeah, Jessie, we had something similar to this in South Knoxville where we were wanting to make sure that somebody didn't get credit for overall density with that back acreage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3365)|
| 0:56:15| or some other acreage that was very steep that we considered would be more like one per the acre or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3375)|
| 0:56:21| So is there, when we asked for three per the acre, is it on all the acreage or just the acreage minus the undisturbed piece in the back to come up with the maximum density?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3381)|
| 0:56:33| Yeah, so since the property location and the traffic impact letter did meet the criteria for three dwelling units an acre for the entire acreage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3393)|
| 0:56:45| that was granted in this recommendation with the condition that the rear portion not being included in the development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3405)|
| 0:56:54| but could be included in the density calculation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3414)|
| 0:56:58| So that was seen as a bit of an incentive as described in the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3418)|
| 0:57:09| Alright, moving on to Whitney for items number 16 and 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3429)|
| 0:57:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3448)|
| 0:57:54| So number 28 12022 RZ, east of Childress Road and west of Pedigo Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3474)|
| 0:58:04| This is a rezoning from A to RA. This site is approximately point seven acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3484)|
| 0:58:12| And this was postponed from last month, due to the request of the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3492)|
| 0:58:19| This site is a portion of this larger parcel that it's not abutting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3499)|
| 0:58:25| It's approximately five acres. So in total, it's approximately 5.7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3505)|
| 0:58:31| This section of parcel avoids the hillside protection area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3511)|
| 0:58:36| And it is consistent with the North County sector plans LDR land use classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3516)|
| 0:58:45| But the recommendation here is to deny RA because it's not consistent with the gross growth policy plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3525)|
| 0:58:52| which doesn't consider RA in the rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3532)|
| 0:58:56| And as you can see, it's just across the street from the land growth area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3536)|
| 0:59:02| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3542)|
| 0:59:12| Number next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3552)|
| 0:59:24| On to 21 1D 23 SP 1K 23 RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3564)|
| 0:59:32| This site's approximately one point seven acres east of Washington Pike and south of Dunsmore Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3572)|
| 0:59:40| Applicant is requesting a sector plan amendment from AG to RR and rezoning from AG to plan residential up to two dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3580)|
| 0:59:56| And this is what Mike spoke on earlier, where the RR is land use classification is in conflict with the growth policy plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3596)|
| 1:00:05| only allowing PR up to one dwelling unit an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3605)|
| 1:00:09| They're requesting two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3609)|
| 1:00:16| And the recommendation is to approve the sector sector plan amendment to RR and approve the zoning amendment PR up to two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3616)|
| 1:00:30| Any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3630)|
| 1:00:35| Oh, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3635)|
| 1:00:38| Next is back to Mike for item number 38.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3638)|
| 1:01:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3669)|
| 1:01:10| So item 38, it's the Beeler Road subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3670)|
| 1:01:13| I just want to introduce this one to everybody since we heard the Fairview Road subdivision in the past couple months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3673)|
| 1:01:23| This is a modification to the July 2022 subdivision that was approved for 86 lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3683)|
| 1:01:32| It was called the B&B Builder subdivision at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3692)|
| 1:01:35| And then last month we approved the Fairview Road subdivision with a condition that the road in this subdivision be extended to that to provide access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3695)|
| 1:01:45| Now we're here with this concept plan, which is called the Beeler Road subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3705)|
| 1:01:53| The overall layout of the subdivision really hasn't changed much at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3713)|
| 1:01:57| The road system is essentially the same, with the exception of extending the road to the adjacent property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3717)|
| 1:02:04| They have changed the lot type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3724)|
| 1:02:07| The original approval was for attached houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3727)|
| 1:02:11| This is now detached houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3731)|
| 1:02:17| And you can kind of see here where the road was being extended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3737)|
| 1:02:22| They removed the cul-de-sac at the end of Road D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3742)|
| 1:02:26| Another minor change is that the original plan had a trail system around their detention pond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3746)|
| 1:02:34| There's a TVA power line that comes through here, so their detention was in that power line easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3754)|
| 1:02:39| They had a little trail that went around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3759)|
| 1:02:41| They've removed that from their plan now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3761)|
| 1:02:43| There's also an existing farm pond on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3763)|
| 1:02:47| They originally intended to have a little path that went up to the pond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3767)|
| 1:02:50| That's no longer part of the plan either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3770)|
| 1:02:52| They have a house lot now just north of the pond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3772)|
| 1:02:57| Previous plan, the Planning Commission also had a condition that they extend their trail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3777)|
| 1:03:05| or pedestrian path to the adjacent property to the east to provide at least a pedestrian connection between the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3785)|
| 1:03:13| This plan, obviously, since they don't have a trail system, they don't propose that connection either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3793)|
| 1:03:23| Some of the conditions that I want to make you aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3803)|
| 1:03:29| One is that we are recommending a right-of-way stub out at the intersection of Road A and Road D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3809)|
| 1:03:37| This would then provide a connection to the property to the south,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3817)|
| 1:03:41| the same as a pedestrian connection that the Planning Commission required last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3821)|
| 1:03:48| Pedestrian connection obviously would come through that right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3828)|
| 1:03:53| The other component is a greenway easement along this blue line stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3833)|
| 1:04:03| The condition states that it could either come at the end of the Road A cul-de-sac| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3843)|
| 1:04:08| or from Road D where the creek goes underneath the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3848)|
| 1:04:14| Eventually, the thought is that there could be a greenway connection then to the Beaver Creek proposed greenway corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3854)|
| 1:04:23| just to the south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3863)|
| 1:04:24| It would still require a greenway easement through the property to the south| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3864)|
| 1:04:28| or the greenway would at least provide that option in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3868)|
| 1:04:34| Part of that condition states that if there's another location either in the Beaver Road subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3874)|
| 1:04:42| or in the Fairview Road subdivision that's more advantageous for connection to the greenway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3882)|
| 1:04:47| then that could be moved to that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3887)|
| 1:04:50| Since we're seeing these in two separate subdivisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3890)|
| 1:04:53| it's kind of hard to really know where the best spot's going to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3893)|
| 1:04:57| so that can be determined during the design plan phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3897)|
| 1:05:03| Another component of the recommended condition for the stub-out is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3903)|
| 1:05:09| so during the Fairview Road subdivision approval, staff was recommending one stub-out to the north property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3909)|
| 1:05:18| Ultimately, two stub-outs were required as part of the condition from the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3918)|
| 1:05:24| One to the north, as staff recommended, and then also one to the south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3924)|
| 1:05:27| The applicant at the time had discussed about adding a stub-out to the south,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3927)|
| 1:05:32| which is great if that works out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3932)|
| 1:05:35| To the south is the Beaver Creek floodway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3935)|
| 1:05:38| It's pretty extensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3938)|
| 1:05:40| Staff has some concerns whether or not that can actually be feasibly used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3940)|
| 1:05:45| So this condition, the stub-out here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3945)|
| 1:05:48| says that one of the two stub-outs in the Fairview Road subdivision can be eliminated at the developer's option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3948)|
| 1:05:56| So we end up with two stub-outs still.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3956)|
| 1:05:58| This one, staff feels, is probably the most feasible for actually creating a second access point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3958)|
| 1:06:04| because the large property to the south here has its own frontage on Beaver Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3964)|
| 1:06:09| Best case scenario, what we'd hope for is another connection to a different road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3969)|
| 1:06:16| either to Fairview or back to West Emory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3976)|
| 1:06:19| but those have more obstacles and definitely be harder to actually obtain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3979)|
| 1:06:26| So we feel that this stub-out is at least needed to create at least a feasible and easier secondary connection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=3986)|
| 1:06:40| Betty?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4000)|
| 1:06:42| I'd love to know if there was some rationale why they decided to get rid of all the walking trails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4002)|
| 1:06:48| especially since there was a condition that we put on of extending it to the adjacent property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4008)|
| 1:06:54| I think it's just a different concept of development that was desired by the builder at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4014)|
| 1:07:03| Different builders, different ideas of what they wanted to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4023)|
| 1:07:06| Wouldn't preclude them from installing walking trails still.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4026)|
| 1:07:10| They could still do it if they chose to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4030)|
| 1:07:14| The pedestrian connection was...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4034)|
| 1:07:20| There was a lot of discussion of stub-outs and connectivity to adjacent properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4040)|
| 1:07:25| and that's where the pedestrian connection came into play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4045)|
| 1:07:28| We saw an opportunity that, okay, they have this walking trail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4048)|
| 1:07:31| It's not too far from this other property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4051)|
| 1:07:34| Extend that pedestrian path to the adjacent property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4054)|
| 1:07:38| With the stub-out, that pretty much takes care of both of those problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4058)|
| 1:07:42| Obviously, it takes something to be constructed to actually create that pedestrian connection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4062)|
| 1:07:49| but this creates the same result in the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4069)|
| 1:07:56| And I guess I'm just wanting to make sure because how it just feels right this second is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4076)|
| 1:08:01| we went through all of this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4081)|
| 1:08:03| We all came up with, voted on, here's what we...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4083)|
| 1:08:08| The conditions and all this stuff, they're coming back because they didn't apparently...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4088)|
| 1:08:12| Just how it feels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4092)|
| 1:08:13| They didn't like those conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4093)|
| 1:08:15| They're now changing it and wanting something else approved after we already deliberated on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4095)|
| 1:08:20| So I know we can't deliberate here, but that's just kind of how it feels right this second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4100)|
| 1:08:24| so I'd just love a little bit more clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4104)|
| 1:08:26| I don't know if we can just make sure the applicant knows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4106)|
| 1:08:29| I'd love to hear just a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4109)|
| 1:08:35| I can't remember when they initially applied for the B&B builders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4115)|
| 1:08:39| if they showed a walking trail around the detention area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4119)|
| 1:08:44| or if that was something staff recommended and they included in their design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4124)|
| 1:08:49| before it came to the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4129)|
| 1:08:51| I can't remember what the steps there were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4131)|
| 1:08:54| Something you might want to also check is that may have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4134)|
| 1:08:57| before we eliminated the sidewalks inside the subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4137)|
| 1:09:00| so they may have been connected to sidewalks internally maybe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4140)|
| 1:09:03| That one, well, that was in June of 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4143)|
| 1:09:08| So in this case, they did not...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4148)|
| 1:09:12| At the time, we did not require a sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4152)|
| 1:09:15| They didn't have enough traffic in the subdivision and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4155)|
| 1:09:20| Is this zone PR?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4160)|
| 1:09:23| It is currently zone PR, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4163)|
| 1:09:26| So I guess the question I would have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4166)|
| 1:09:28| back to the very tired and beaten horse of what are the amenities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4168)|
| 1:09:32| is if the walking trails are removed, are there any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4172)|
| 1:09:42| There's still a lot of open space, but I'll honor the TVA tower area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4182)|
| 1:09:47| but they're not proposing anything that is constructed as part of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4187)|
| 1:09:53| Is it possible for you to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4193)|
| 1:09:56| I don't think that these specific graphics that you're sharing today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4196)|
| 1:10:01| are in the actual report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4201)|
| 1:10:04| This here, where it shows the previous...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4204)|
| 1:10:06| Yeah, is it possible for you to share those with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4206)|
| 1:10:09| Yeah, it's in the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4209)|
| 1:10:12| Well, yeah, I can do that. That's not a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4212)|
| 1:10:15| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4215)|
| 1:10:18| Mike, is there anything that precludes them from building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4218)|
| 1:10:21| and constructing walking paths underneath those TVA towers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4221)|
| 1:10:25| Is there an issue with having those there, is that a yes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4225)|
| 1:10:28| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4228)|
| 1:10:29| Typically no. It's not typically a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4229)|
| 1:10:32| TVA doesn't want structures and things like that in their easements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4232)|
| 1:10:39| It seems like, Jim, you might have more experience with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4239)|
| 1:10:42| but they typically are okay with detention ponds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4242)|
| 1:10:47| KUB is usually not a fan of having anything built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4247)|
| 1:10:51| underneath their power line easements, even detention ponds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4251)|
| 1:10:54| They'd probably be okay with a path of some sort or a greenway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4254)|
| 1:10:58| but they don't want to have anything constructed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4258)|
| 1:11:00| But TVA is typically okay with a detention pond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4260)|
| 1:11:03| something like that in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4263)|
| 1:11:10| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4270)|
| 1:11:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4273)|
| 1:11:15| The last one, planning staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4275)|
| 1:11:20| Michelle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4280)|
| 1:11:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4283)|
| 1:11:41| So this last one is a cluster of amendments that we're recommending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4301)|
| 1:11:46| to the CA and CB zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4306)|
| 1:11:48| the addition of standards for drive-through facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4308)|
| 1:11:50| and a reference to the zones already allowing drive-through facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4310)|
| 1:11:55| So we're adding several land uses to the CA and CB zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4315)|
| 1:11:59| And just as a reminder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4319)|
| 1:12:00| this originally came from the Alcor Highway Corridor Study recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4320)|
| 1:12:04| And while the uses that are proposed would align those in the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4324)|
| 1:12:08| with those in the city more closely along that corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4328)|
| 1:12:11| because we're recommending changes to the zone itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4331)|
| 1:12:13| it's applicable countywide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4333)|
| 1:12:15| So we're looking at it a little more holistically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4335)|
| 1:12:17| This is a short-term solution until a new zoning code is adopted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4337)|
| 1:12:20| after the advanced NOCs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4340)|
| 1:12:22| As you all know, they're going to be moving forward with some changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4342)|
| 1:12:25| more comprehensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4345)|
| 1:12:30| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4350)|
| 1:12:43| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4363)|
| 1:12:46| Sorry, technical difficulties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4366)|
| 1:12:48| Looks like I lost that screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4368)|
| 1:13:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4386)|
| 1:13:19| Still waiting on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4399)|
| 1:13:20| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4400)|
| 1:13:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4401)|
| 1:13:23| So looking at sort of the range of intensity of uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4403)|
| 1:13:26| you've got residential sort of on the lower end of the –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4406)|
| 1:13:30| lost it again –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4410)|
| 1:13:31| on the lower end where it kind of ranges through a variety of residential types,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4411)|
| 1:13:36| from single-family residential and duplexes on this end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4416)|
| 1:13:39| going through townhouses, multifamily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4419)|
| 1:13:41| into more transitional uses like office parks, office buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4421)|
| 1:13:45| again with multifamily, your commercial and industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4425)|
| 1:13:49| And so the uses that are allowed in CA and CB kind of skip over this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4429)|
| 1:13:54| So right now we have single-family residential and duplexes that are allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4434)|
| 1:13:58| and then a range of commercial that allows like dry cleaning shops and restaurants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4438)|
| 1:14:04| There's, you know, auto repair facilities and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4444)|
| 1:14:09| So the absence of these uses kind of deprives that area of maybe having some transitional –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4449)|
| 1:14:16| some transitions between those, the low-density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4456)|
| 1:14:19| and the high-density residential uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4459)|
| 1:14:25| In the CA zone in general, we are adding clinics, medical offices, and dental offices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4465)|
| 1:14:31| just because that's kind of more in line with what's already allowed by offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4471)|
| 1:14:35| This was requested by the Knox County Codes Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4475)|
| 1:14:38| We felt like it aligned well with what we were trying to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4478)|
| 1:14:40| so that's been incorporated to be use-permitted by right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4480)|
| 1:14:43| In the CA zone, we're adding drive-through facilities located on arterial streets by right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4483)|
| 1:14:48| and we're restricting them to use on review on collector streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4488)|
| 1:14:52| They would not be allowed on local streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4492)|
| 1:14:54| Also permitted on review as a use on review is multi-dwelling, multi-family establishments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4494)|
| 1:15:00| attached houses, and upper-level dwellings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4500)|
| 1:15:05| And the reason we've kind of restricted, I guess, is the word I'm looking for in the CA zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4505)|
| 1:15:11| the drive-through facilities is because, you know, when you look at the description of the zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4511)|
| 1:15:16| and when you think about the fact that CA and CB are some of the more intense commercial zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4516)|
| 1:15:21| in the county, you would think that it would be just applicable and would be not a bad idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4521)|
| 1:15:27| But because we have some of these older properties that are zoned CA prior to the adoption of some of our sector plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4527)|
| 1:15:32| there's some random placements out there that are not really supported by the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4532)|
| 1:15:37| and allowing a drive-through facility right now, as it is currently the practice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4537)|
| 1:15:41| could be a little bit problematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4541)|
| 1:15:44| So we're adding the drive-through facilities really for two reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4544)|
| 1:15:46| So if you look at CA and CB, it lists restaurants and other things that have drive-throughs as a use by right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4546)|
| 1:15:52| but then when you look at CN and CR, those break out drive-through facilities into their own use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4552)|
| 1:15:57| with apparent use allowed as a permitted use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4557)|
| 1:16:00| So, for example, a restaurant would be allowed by right, but a drive-through would be as a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4560)|
| 1:16:04| Same thing with a bank and an ATM, pharmacy, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4564)|
| 1:16:07| So because it's broken out as a separate use in those zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4567)|
| 1:16:11| it kind of becomes a little bit muddy as to whether or not they would be allowed in the CA and CB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4571)|
| 1:16:15| So we're wanting to codify how that would be allowed within these two zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4575)|
| 1:16:19| but also understanding that because there are so many of these random properties out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4579)|
| 1:16:24| that abut residential properties, there's a need for some drive-through standards to be created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4584)|
| 1:16:29| So we've added that to the amendment package as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4589)|
| 1:16:33| I'm kind of zooming in a little bit, and you guys have the PDF of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4593)|
| 1:16:36| so you can kind of zoom in on your own time when you're able to look at it more closely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4596)|
| 1:16:40| but you can see some of these red speckles as I've kind of zoomed in closer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4600)|
| 1:16:44| So this is the northern part of the county, so that kind of is representative of where there's some of these random CA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4604)|
| 1:16:50| This is the northeastern section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4610)|
| 1:16:52| You can see it again in the southern part of the county, so it's pretty prevalent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4612)|
| 1:16:56| I'd say the west isn't as bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4616)|
| 1:16:58| Maybe there's a handful of properties like this in the Hardin Valley area as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4618)|
| 1:17:03| That's why we're in CA, kind of restricting it to arterials as permitted by right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4623)|
| 1:17:09| and then along with collectors as a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4629)|
| 1:17:12| Either way, they would be beholden to the standards that we're creating with the drive-through standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4632)|
| 1:17:16| in Section 4.108 that we're creating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4636)|
| 1:17:20| So the CB zone allows that same range of uses as CA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4640)|
| 1:17:23| but it expands to allow certain manufacturing uses and limited outdoor storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4643)|
| 1:17:28| And so due to the more intense character of that zone's intent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4648)|
| 1:17:31| and the addition of standards for drive-throughs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4651)|
| 1:17:33| and there's not as many of those random properties with that CB zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4653)|
| 1:17:38| so we felt like it was okay to propose the drive-through facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4658)|
| 1:17:43| be located on arterials and collector streets permitted by right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4663)|
| 1:17:46| Of course, again, still beholden to that standard that we're creating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4666)|
| 1:17:50| Also clinics, medical uses, and dental offices would be by right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4670)|
| 1:17:54| Multifamily structures, attached houses, and upper dwelling units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4674)|
| 1:17:57| these would all be permitted as uses on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4677)|
| 1:17:59| And how we've handled the residential within CA and CB is the same way that it's done through OB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4679)|
| 1:18:04| so we're just referring people to that RB section of the zoning code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4684)|
| 1:18:08| and we've specified that it's subsections 05 through 10,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4688)|
| 1:18:12| which talks about the setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4692)|
| 1:18:14| It talks about the lot coverage, lot area, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4694)|
| 1:18:19| So it regulates those type of things, but not the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4699)|
| 1:18:22| So in CA and CB, it would be allowed up to just be permissible as a use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4702)|
| 1:18:28| regardless of what the density would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4708)|
| 1:18:32| And then, again, just looking at the distribution of the CB zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4712)|
| 1:18:35| really there were very few areas that weren't on arterials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4715)|
| 1:18:38| Some of these that you see down here, these are long island home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4718)|
| 1:18:41| One of these is an abandoned church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4721)|
| 1:18:43| The others are already developed with single-family residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4723)|
| 1:18:46| So, again, because of the limited number of properties that would be affected by this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4726)|
| 1:18:50| and the fact that there are standards for them to apply, for them to adhere to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4730)|
| 1:18:58| we felt like it was appropriate to have that as just a permitted use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4738)|
| 1:19:05| Okay, so now into the standards for drive-through facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4745)|
| 1:19:10| We've basically created two tiers, so no matter where,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4750)|
| 1:19:14| whether it's abutting residential or not, there's locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4754)|
| 1:19:18| We've already talked about the arterials and collectors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4758)|
| 1:19:20| but we also address the stacking of the vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4760)|
| 1:19:23| So there's three for drive-through facilities other than restaurants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4763)|
| 1:19:26| and four for restaurants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4766)|
| 1:19:27| And that's just recognizing the fact that restaurants are typically busier than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4767)|
| 1:19:31| a pharmacy drive-through or an ATM drive-through bank would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4771)|
| 1:19:35| So making sure that the site plans kind of take that into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4775)|
| 1:19:39| There's also a provision in there for vehicular light screening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4779)|
| 1:19:43| So if the site plan is designed in a way that the vehicles that are approaching| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4783)|
| 1:19:48| the drive-through at any point are signing into residential property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4788)|
| 1:19:52| there's some standards in there for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4792)|
| 1:19:55| But then we kind of added more for whenever there's a situation in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4795)|
| 1:19:59| a drive-through abutting a residential property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4799)|
| 1:20:01| So we've added standards for sound attenuation, looking at decibel levels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4801)|
| 1:20:05| speaker box location, and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4805)|
| 1:20:08| There's exterior lighting standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4808)|
| 1:20:10| and there's a landscape screening visual buffering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4810)|
| 1:20:13| And these are all based on industry standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4813)|
| 1:20:15| So sound standards came from the Housing and Urban Development publication,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4815)|
| 1:20:19| the Noise Guidebook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4819)|
| 1:20:21| So there's a track changes version of that that has some comments off to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4821)|
| 1:20:24| side that kind of talked about where we got some of the numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4824)|
| 1:20:26| what we're basing that off of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4826)|
| 1:20:28| Same thing for lighting guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4828)|
| 1:20:30| Those are roughly based on the USGBC's model lighting ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4830)|
| 1:20:33| That allows a maximum of 0.1 foot candles at residential lot lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4833)|
| 1:20:37| We're recommending 0.2 instead, and that's based on a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4837)|
| 1:20:42| Right now in the county we've got the technology overlay zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4842)|
| 1:20:46| which is governed by the TTCDA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4846)|
| 1:20:48| and the standards in that are 0.2 foot candles along residential lot lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4848)|
| 1:20:54| So we felt like we wanted to not have the base zone requirements be more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4854)|
| 1:20:58| restrictive than the overlay design requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4858)|
| 1:21:00| so we're matching what's in that already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4860)|
| 1:21:03| keeping in mind that the photometric plans that lighting designers are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4863)|
| 1:21:07| submitting are going to be showing that 0.2 foot candles at residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4867)|
| 1:21:10| property lines, but they also don't take into account any of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4870)|
| 1:21:14| vegetable vegetation screening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4874)|
| 1:21:17| And so once you factor in the trees and bushes and things like that that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4877)|
| 1:21:21| required next to a residential property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4881)|
| 1:21:24| that will lower the lighting levels experienced at the residential property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4884)|
| 1:21:27| line beyond that 0.2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4887)|
| 1:21:31| And then also we've added in a requirement to add dimming devices to light| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4891)|
| 1:21:34| fixtures, and these will automatically reduce lighting levels at curfew,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4894)|
| 1:21:38| which we're stating will be 10 p.m.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4898)|
| 1:21:41| and we're also calling for that to lower them to 20 percent beyond what they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4901)|
| 1:21:45| would be otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4905)|
| 1:21:47| So the Illuminating Engineering Society recommends dimmers be reduced lighting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4907)|
| 1:21:52| by 30 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4912)|
| 1:21:53| Again, we're not coming in quite as stringent as that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4913)|
| 1:21:55| just due to the fact that there's that vegetative buffer that's required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4915)|
| 1:21:58| along the lot lines that would reduce this more in line with what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4918)|
| 1:22:02| Illuminating Engineering Society is requiring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4922)|
| 1:22:07| And then finally, we're adding just a housekeeping issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4927)|
| 1:22:10| We're adding statements to zones that currently specify that drive-through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4930)|
| 1:22:14| facilities are allowed, and that's just a little line item saying, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4934)|
| 1:22:18| per section 4.108 drive-through facility standards so that it's clear to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4938)|
| 1:22:22| anyone wanting to do a drive-through in those zones that they need to refer to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4942)|
| 1:22:25| that section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4945)|
| 1:22:28| And I'm sure you all might have questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4948)|
| 1:22:31| Yeah, Michelle, the question I've got is if it's a use permitted on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4951)|
| 1:22:38| or if it's permitted by right in a CB situation that's zoned next to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4958)|
| 1:22:43| residential and they just go to codes to submit plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4963)|
| 1:22:48| are we going to come up with a set of screen criteria that's visual that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4968)|
| 1:22:56| all can agree on with county codes where county codes knows that if it's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4976)|
| 1:23:01| permitted by right in CB, it has to require a certain type of buffer or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4981)|
| 1:23:04| screen, whereas we would expect the same thing when we see the use on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4984)|
| 1:23:09| where they're not all over the board and we're just all up here deciding to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4989)|
| 1:23:13| add stuff for any reason or no reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4993)|
| 1:23:15| Is there for consistency?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4995)|
| 1:23:17| Mm-hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4997)|
| 1:23:18| We've worked with Knox County Codes in the development of this, and so we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=4998)|
| 1:23:21| tried to build in ways for them to verify so that's not so the onus is on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5001)|
| 1:23:26| the developer to show that, hey, I've got a photometric plan showing what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5006)|
| 1:23:30| lighting level is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5010)|
| 1:23:31| I'm telling you what the attenuation of my wall is, or I have a sound| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5011)|
| 1:23:36| professional saying that, you know, if I'm not using a wall that I'm reaching| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5016)|
| 1:23:39| that same level of sound attenuation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5019)|
| 1:23:41| So there's factors like that that are built into the way this is written so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5021)|
| 1:23:44| that whenever codes does get a permit application, they're able to review that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5024)|
| 1:23:48| according to the standards that we're creating so that they'll be providing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5028)|
| 1:23:52| that same level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5032)|
| 1:23:53| Lighting is a little easier when you've got those photometric plans that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5033)|
| 1:23:56| engineers can put in and it pretty much spits out based on the type of light| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5036)|
| 1:24:00| fixtures that you're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5040)|
| 1:24:02| The computer generates it, but the landscaping's typically a little different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5042)|
| 1:24:07| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5047)|
| 1:24:08| Well, we've, let's see, I'll go into the standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5048)|
| 1:24:12| I've got them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5052)|
| 1:24:14| You don't have to go in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5054)|
| 1:24:15| As long as there's a consistent standard that we all expect every time we see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5055)|
| 1:24:19| these things, I guess is the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5059)|
| 1:24:22| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5062)|
| 1:24:24| Again, we've worked with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5064)|
| 1:24:25| I feel like we have that in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5065)|
| 1:24:27| We can take a second look at it if you don't feel like it's specific enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5067)|
| 1:24:32| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5072)|
| 1:24:34| I have a general question about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5074)|
| 1:24:39| What to me seems like a significant change to the ordinance to have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5079)|
| 1:24:45| drive-through facilities allowed by right as opposed to largely by review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5085)|
| 1:24:52| And if the county is undergoing the significant general plan change and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5092)|
| 1:25:00| assessment of where things should be, and it seems like there is a desire from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5100)|
| 1:25:07| the preliminary sharing that it be less car-centric, a desirability for greater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5107)|
| 1:25:13| walkability, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5113)|
| 1:25:16| Why would we want to encourage drive-through facilities by right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5116)|
| 1:25:26| The way in practice it's already been done by right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5126)|
| 1:25:29| So right now someone that has a property that's zoned CA or CB could put in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5129)|
| 1:25:33| drive-through by right without any standards at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5133)|
| 1:25:37| So this is more about the application of standards than the changing of it to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5137)|
| 1:25:43| by right or by?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5143)|
| 1:25:45| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5145)|
| 1:25:46| So we're codifying how it's already done in practice, just to clarify, because of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5146)|
| 1:25:49| the difference in how it's done within the CN, the CR, and the TC specifying that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5149)|
| 1:25:53| drive-through facility, but not in CA and CB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5153)|
| 1:25:56| It's being done by practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5156)|
| 1:25:57| So we're codifying that, how it's done currently, while providing standards so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5157)|
| 1:26:03| that there's something that provides a level of protection to abutting properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5163)|
| 1:26:08| with drive-throughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5168)|
| 1:26:10| And it seems to me like they're either limiting it even further by the collector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5170)|
| 1:26:15| streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5175)|
| 1:26:17| So CB is a very intense zone by nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5177)|
| 1:26:20| You can do open outdoor storage without screening, and there's a lot of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5180)|
| 1:26:24| that you can do, car lots and that kind of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5184)|
| 1:26:27| And to add specific streets that they can even be on, like it can't be a minor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5187)|
| 1:26:32| collector even to ask our permission for it, that seems to be a fairly big step, in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5192)|
| 1:26:41| my view, to what you're asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5201)|
| 1:26:45| I think that's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5205)|
| 1:26:55| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5215)|
| 1:26:57| I do have a question regarding another agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5217)|
| 1:27:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5221)|
| 1:27:02| So now we're to the point where you can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5222)|
| 1:27:06| This is for Liz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5226)|
| 1:27:07| I just wanted some clarification on its agenda item 13, where you guys are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5227)|

| 1:27:22| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5242)|
| 1:27:23| Do you mind giving me a case file number so I can pull it up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5243)|
| 1:27:25| Item 13, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5245)|
| 1:27:27| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5247)|
| 1:27:28| It's 1Q23RZ, and there's a sector plan and a plan amendment, one-year plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5248)|
| 1:27:32| amendment, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5252)|
| 1:27:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5253)|
| 1:27:35| CMC Steel US.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5255)|
| 1:27:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5258)|
| 1:27:39| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5259)|
| 1:27:40| Hang on just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5260)|
| 1:28:04| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5284)|
| 1:28:34| Sorry, just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5314)|
| 1:29:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5344)|
| 1:29:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5370)|
| 1:29:31| So this is an item that currently has some existing HI designation on it within both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5371)|
| 1:29:44| the sector plan and the one-year plan for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5384)|
| 1:29:51| So they're asking for an extension of that HI designation to this area here in both the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5391)|
| 1:30:00| sector plan and the one-year plan, and then they're asking for IH zoning for this entire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5400)|
| 1:30:08| area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5408)|
| 1:30:09| If we look at the aerial, you can see kind of that this area has been fenced off and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5409)|
| 1:30:17| used for quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5417)|
| 1:30:20| I think I detail in the staff report about how this area had been replatted, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5420)|
| 1:30:29| in 2013, which would have been after the central city sector plan was updated for this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5429)|
| 1:30:37| and it talked about the Lonsdale small area plan referencing the need for a greenway and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5437)|
| 1:30:44| or some green space adjacent to these residential areas in this industrial space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5444)|
| 1:30:54| So they replatted that property and dedicated more right-of-way and a greenway easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5454)|
| 1:31:01| in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5461)|
| 1:31:03| So staff is, you know, recommending approval because this is a minor extension of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5463)|
| 1:31:12| industrial area into this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5472)|
| 1:31:14| It's already shown on the sector plan for at least a majority of the site as heavy industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5474)|
| 1:31:22| And again, this greenway area has been designated here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5482)|
| 1:31:27| Let me see if I can pull up the sector plan, or this, sorry, the staff report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5487)|
| 1:31:36| Yeah, so here is the section where we talk about changes and conditions in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5496)|
| 1:31:55| So there were several lots that were combined as one lot, so that's why it looks like one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5515)|
| 1:32:01| large lot now on right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5521)|
| 1:32:04| And easements were dedicated as part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5524)|
| 1:32:07| And then a portion of that area was already designated HI, sorry, as part of the 2014| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5527)|
| 1:32:13| central city sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5533)|
| 1:32:15| And however, a portion of that property at that time did have a house on it, and it retained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5535)|
| 1:32:22| that TDR designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5542)|
| 1:32:26| The Lonsdale small area plan in this area showed a greenway easement and some sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5546)|
| 1:32:35| green space buffering adjacent to that industrial area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5555)|
| 1:32:39| And so that replatting that they did kind of provided that as a transitional area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5559)|
| 1:32:47| Let's see, the right-of-way improvements occurred after the adoption of the sector plan, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5567)|
| 1:32:54| the combined parcel was currently split between two land use designations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5574)|
| 1:33:00| So does that make any sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5580)|
| 1:33:07| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5587)|
| 1:33:08| I thought I had an exhibit here that showed some of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5588)|
| 1:33:22| Maybe not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5602)|
| 1:33:26| So if I roll back the aerial, you can see there used to be a house here, and that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5606)|
| 1:33:35| probably why it was shown as TDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5615)|
| 1:33:49| So is that Garner Street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5629)|
| 1:33:52| Does it continue, does it divide that property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5632)|
| 1:33:55| This street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5635)|
| 1:33:56| Yeah, that Garner, I guess it's Garner, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5636)|
| 1:33:59| Oh, Gloria Garner Street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5639)|
| 1:34:01| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5641)|
| 1:34:02| Does it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5642)|
| 1:34:03| No, it dead ends here and then turns into New York Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5643)|
| 1:34:06| So this house is not here anymore either, and there's been some alleyway improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5646)|
| 1:34:11| So when we sort of show what it looks like now, there's now this alleyway that separates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5651)|
| 1:34:20| this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5660)|
| 1:34:21| So there's a little bit more of a boundary, I would say, that is separating the industrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5661)|
| 1:34:28| area from the residential area because of some of the improvements that were done here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5668)|
| 1:34:34| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5674)|
| 1:34:37| See you guys Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230110-agenda-review?start=5677)|
