| 2:18:22| Mike Arms, 201 Ivy Gate Lane, Farragut, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8302)|
| 2:18:28| AMR has put together a community report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8308)|
| 2:18:31| It will be a colored magazine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8311)|
| 2:18:34| All they want to do is just update the commission on what they've been doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8314)|
| 2:18:38| Items like having an ambulance at every high school game is not part of the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8318)|
| 2:18:43| They do that out of gratuity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8323)|
| 2:18:45| The training on CPR training, stop the bleed training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8325)|
| 2:18:49| So they just felt like it was appropriate to stay in touch with you on a regular basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8329)|
| 2:18:53| So they'll give you a report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8333)|
| 2:18:55| You can ask questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8335)|
| 2:18:56| And hopefully it will be shorter than this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8336)|
| 2:18:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8338)|
| 2:18:59| So when you say that, all right, Mike, so what you're saying is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8339)|
| 2:19:03| are they planning on reporting at next week's meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8343)|
| 2:19:06| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8346)|
| 2:19:07| They have the report ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8347)|
| 2:19:09| So we will send this forward with no recommendation to get the update at next week's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8349)|
| 2:19:14| It's just an information exchange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8354)|
| 2:19:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8355)|
| 2:19:16| I want you to know what you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8356)|
| 2:19:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8357)|
| 2:19:21| We'll carry it over to next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8361)|
| 2:19:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8362)|
| 2:19:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8364)|
| 2:19:26| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8366)|
| 2:19:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8368)|
| 2:19:30| Item number 55, discussion regarding motion that has been filed for attorney fees in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8370)|
| 2:19:36| versus Knox County Retirement and Pension Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8376)|
| 2:19:39| Discussion to include legal representation of Knox County's interest in this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8379)|
| 2:19:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8384)|
| 2:19:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8385)|
| 2:19:46| I added this item to our discussion agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8386)|
| 2:19:48| By the way, I recognize we do have attorneys who had signed up originally for the public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8388)|
| 2:19:53| and we said you could speak at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8393)|
| 2:19:55| But I do want to make sure that my fellow commissioners understand why this item was added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8395)|
| 2:20:01| In this matter, the Knox County Law Department does have a conflict related to this lawsuit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8401)|
| 2:20:07| which was why they originally had hired an outside attorney to represent the county in this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8407)|
| 2:20:14| This is probably going to be the last hearing related to this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8414)|
| 2:20:19| And at present, because of the conflict, Knox County does not have a legal representative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8419)|
| 2:20:25| to represent the county's interest in this last hearing as it relates to the legal fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8425)|
| 2:20:31| I believe the hearing is on the 29th of this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8431)|
| 2:20:36| So I've added this onto the agenda specifically because I believe we need to come up with some form of a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8436)|
| 2:20:44| or a solution so that when you have that legal hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8444)|
| 2:20:47| the table representing Knox County does not have an attorney representing our interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8447)|
| 2:20:54| That's the basics, and I think I've kind of represented the letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8454)|
| 2:20:58| The Law Department had informed me that they were the ones who were conflicted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8458)|
| 2:21:01| and could not represent us in this last hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8461)|
| 2:21:04| It's not that we had a conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8464)|
| 2:21:06| It's that we were ordered to dismiss the case and for us to get out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8466)|
| 2:21:12| So we're not in the case, and you all need representation in the motion, which is before the court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8472)|
| 2:21:18| and we're not in the case anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8478)|
| 2:21:20| So that's why we figured you needed something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8480)|
| 2:21:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8482)|
| 2:21:23| Thank you for that clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8483)|
| 2:21:26| Is the hearing date the 28th or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8486)|
| 2:21:29| Is it the 28th or the 29th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8489)|
| 2:21:31| The 28th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8491)|
| 2:21:32| The 28th, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8492)|
| 2:21:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8496)|
| 2:21:37| So with that said, what I'd like to do, I told you all that I'd give you all your public forum time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8497)|
| 2:21:42| at this moment in the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8502)|
| 2:21:44| So I'll go ahead and go back to that order to allow you all to address commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8504)|
| 2:21:51| The order was Herb followed by Al followed by Steve Garrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8511)|
| 2:21:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8517)|
| 2:21:58| My name is Herbert Monsier, 550 West Main Street, Suite 775, Knoxville, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8518)|
| 2:22:07| I'm going to pass out what we propose to be a resolution as to the sensible way to resolve the attorney fees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8527)|
| 2:22:16| if I could ask Mr. Holifield to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8536)|
| 2:22:20| The situation that we are in, as you will recall when I first came before you in August| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8540)|
| 2:22:26| and asked that you authorize the private attorneys to be hired to represent the 635 members of the Knox County Sheriff's Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8546)|
| 2:22:37| who was the class that had been sued, I recall that the feeling at that time was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8557)|
| 2:22:45| well, let's wait and see if the chancellor certifies a class, number one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8565)|
| 2:22:50| and number two, whether he appoints representatives to the class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8570)|
| 2:22:54| And that's exactly what we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8574)|
| 2:22:57| We went to a hearing in which the chancellor did certify a class of all of the present| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8577)|
| 2:23:03| and the retired members of the UOP plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8583)|
| 2:23:09| The chancellor also appointed as representatives the individuals that were before the court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8589)|
| 2:23:17| and authorized their attorneys, that was myself, Mr. Holifield, and Mr. Stephen Garrett, to represent the class,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8597)|
| 2:23:26| and we proceeded forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8606)|
| 2:23:29| Mr. Holifield is going to field most of the technical questions that you might have with regard to what we have uncovered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8609)|
| 2:23:37| what we have disclosed, and what we have brought for resolution in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8617)|
| 2:23:45| We have accomplished much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8625)|
| 2:23:48| We have defined the abilities of the various officers of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8628)|
| 2:23:54| and let me tell you that that was done on motion of the individual defendants of the class,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8634)|
| 2:24:02| represented by Mr. Holifield, myself, and Mr. Garrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8642)|
| 2:24:06| It was our motion to dismiss, not the retirement board, that brought this matter to the conclusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8646)|
| 2:24:15| Now, I would like to take total credit for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8655)|
| 2:24:19| but I must admit that the mayor's letter and commission's vote at the last was the tools by which we used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8659)|
| 2:24:28| to bring the matter to a conclusion as this commission and this body had wanted to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8668)|
| 2:24:35| We brought it to a very prompt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8675)|
| 2:24:37| As a matter of fact, it happened on a Friday afternoon that I prepared the motion and the response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8677)|
| 2:24:44| that resulted on the following Monday morning, the chancellor dismissing the litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8684)|
| 2:24:49| Now, the question now is how do we get compensated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8689)|
| 2:24:56| And we are here asking that this body pass a resolution appropriating the funds for us to be compensated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8696)|
| 2:25:06| Now, let me explain just a moment how this works under the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8706)|
| 2:25:11| Generally speaking, where there is a body of money to pay attorneys, of which we're asking that you appropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8711)|
| 2:25:20| somebody has to determine whether those requests for fees are reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8720)|
| 2:25:27| Now, in the case of the attorneys hired by Mr. Armstrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8727)|
| 2:25:34| they've been paid every penny for every hour and every minute that they bill for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8734)|
| 2:25:40| Those are public record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8740)|
| 2:25:42| The attorneys that were hired by the retirement board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8742)|
| 2:25:46| they've been paid for every penny, every hour, and every minute that they bill for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8746)|
| 2:25:51| We're not asking for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8751)|
| 2:25:53| You do not have the expertise to sit down and look at our time records| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8753)|
| 2:25:59| and what we did at a particular point in time to determine whether that was reasonable or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8759)|
| 2:26:04| So what we're asking is that you say that we are going to appropriate the funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8764)|
| 2:26:11| but we are asking the court, through its resources and its expertise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8771)|
| 2:26:17| to determine on a review of our itemized bills what is reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8777)|
| 2:26:24| Now, there has to be some organization in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8784)|
| 2:26:26| And by you appropriators saying we will pay the funds, but we need the expertise of somebody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8786)|
| 2:26:34| I'd just as soon as not be Bud Armstrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8794)|
| 2:26:38| That was supposed to be a little joke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8798)|
| 2:26:43| I would just as soon as not be someone that has no expertise in legal proceedings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8803)|
| 2:26:50| And that leaves, of course, the arbiter of the facts, Chester Weaver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8810)|
| 2:26:56| And Chester Weaver has available to him what are known as clerk and masters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8816)|
| 2:27:01| that on a daily basis review applications for attorney fees to determine whether or not they're reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8821)|
| 2:27:08| All right. Mr. Monsier, I know this is going to be consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8828)|
| 2:27:11| So I'll yield to Mr. Holifield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8831)|
| 2:27:13| You wanted to yield to Mr. Holifield. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8833)|
| 2:27:14| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8834)|
| 2:27:21| Al Holifield, 11907 Kingston Pike, Knoxville, Tennessee 37934.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8841)|
| 2:27:27| What you have before you is the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8847)|
| 2:27:30| And what we proposed is we even put a cap in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8850)|
| 2:27:34| because I know some people worried about at the beginning when we were here some time ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8854)|
| 2:27:39| I was not at that particular meeting, but people from my office was and Mr. Monsier was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8859)|
| 2:27:44| Well, we opened up and said we're going to pay you attorney fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8864)|
| 2:27:47| There's no limit, and we've already got, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8867)|
| 2:27:50| there's been Knoxville paper articles written about incurring over 600,000 fees plus in this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8870)|
| 2:27:57| and those bills were through September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8877)|
| 2:27:59| And we're telling you we'll cap the fees we're asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8879)|
| 2:28:03| We'll be at some number less than 190, and that's through our bills as of today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8883)|
| 2:28:09| And so that is the final number, and His Honor will go through the bills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8889)|
| 2:28:14| and determine what's reasonable given the services that were provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8894)|
| 2:28:18| But just remember how we got here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8898)|
| 2:28:22| My client started off as seven individual officers, right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8902)|
| 2:28:28| and I was speaking on behalf of myself and Stephen Garrett too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8908)|
| 2:28:31| because he represented a widow, Renee Wicker, of an officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8911)|
| 2:28:37| All they did is sign a sheet of paper that says I want my pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8917)|
| 2:28:42| And now they're being sued and told that part of their pension that they've got they should not have received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8922)|
| 2:28:47| They're coming to us in a panic based on a promise made by Knox County saying you need legal counsel now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8927)|
| 2:28:54| or your pension is going away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8934)|
| 2:28:56| This wasn't their choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8936)|
| 2:28:59| Then it was a class action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8939)|
| 2:29:02| Then it became something that we're representing the rest of the uniformed officers pension plan members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8942)|
| 2:29:08| about their future benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8948)|
| 2:29:11| And so this was not a making of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8951)|
| 2:29:14| There's very rarely in this United States, do you see, we've done a lot of class action litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8954)|
| 2:29:21| I can tell you this, between my partner and I and everything, we have never done a defense class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8961)|
| 2:29:26| This was our first defense class case ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8966)|
| 2:29:30| And between us, we've been practicing for 60 plus years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8970)|
| 2:29:34| in pretty much every jurisdiction in this country, once in the United States Supreme Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8974)|
| 2:29:41| And so this is unusual to be put in this circumstance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8981)|
| 2:29:43| It's unusual to put officers that raise their right hand to defend a county to say do you want your pension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8983)|
| 2:29:49| but you have to have an attorney to go protect at least a part of that pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8989)|
| 2:29:53| And so really we're making the request on behalf of them because that's who's hired us that's got our legal bills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8993)|
| 2:29:58| We've done what we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8998)|
| 2:30:00| It's public record what the other people have spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9000)|
| 2:30:03| We've done our best to keep our legal bills down and in line to provide this defense for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9003)|
| 2:30:09| And I've got two minutes left, and you all have been here a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9009)|
| 2:30:12| probably longer than you wanted to be here, and certainly didn't want to close here an attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9012)|
| 2:30:17| So with that said, I'll take any questions you have, if you have any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9017)|
| 2:30:23| I think we'll probably have some room for discussion at the end of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9023)|
| 2:30:26| I think Mr. Garrett was also signed up. Is he going to be speaking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9026)|
| 2:30:30| Garrett will not be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9030)|
| 2:30:31| He will not be here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9031)|
| 2:30:32| So we've saved you from one-third of the argument. How about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9032)|
| 2:30:34| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9034)|
| 2:30:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9037)|
| 2:30:38| So what I'd like to do, this is a discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9038)|
| 2:30:40| I'd like to open this up for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9040)|
| 2:30:42| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9042)|
| 2:30:44| Yeah, I think we're kind of on uncharted territory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9044)|
| 2:30:48| I don't think we've ever had an instance where Knox County's filed a lawsuit against an entity of itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9048)|
| 2:30:58| And everybody's connected to the county that's in the lawsuit, and so the lawsuit gets dismissed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9058)|
| 2:31:07| I'm very much in support of paying these legal fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9067)|
| 2:31:11| I have been since day one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9071)|
| 2:31:13| I didn't want an open pocketbook that Mr. Hollifield was talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9073)|
| 2:31:16| I think I was the one that made that statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9076)|
| 2:31:19| But we need to find a way that Knox County is represented in that hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9079)|
| 2:31:26| and we need to find a way to hopefully in this, I don't know if this could be done next Monday or it can be voted in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9086)|
| 2:31:34| but we need to find a resolution between now and Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9094)|
| 2:31:37| We need to find a way to make sure that as they go to court that the judge is aware that we understand we may be on the hook for these bills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9097)|
| 2:31:45| I mean, we've brought people, as Knox County, we brought people into a lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9105)|
| 2:31:52| That lawsuit was dismissed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9112)|
| 2:31:54| And so I think asking Judge Weaver to, Chancellor Weaver, to determine what those, if fees are awarded, what those fees would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9114)|
| 2:32:04| I think it's appropriate that this, that the B County, not this body necessarily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9124)|
| 2:32:10| but it's our fiduciary responsibility, I think, as a county commission to make that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9130)|
| 2:32:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9137)|
| 2:32:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9138)|
| 2:32:19| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9139)|
| 2:32:20| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9140)|
| 2:32:23| Because these are separate issues in terms of who will represent the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9143)|
| 2:32:28| Who drafted this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9148)|
| 2:32:33| That's very important for me, the second question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9153)|
| 2:32:36| And are we going to separate these questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9156)|
| 2:32:40| Who will represent the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9160)|
| 2:32:42| Really, I think it's up to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9162)|
| 2:32:44| I mean, it would be quite blunt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9164)|
| 2:32:46| Because this isn't something I want to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9166)|
| 2:32:48| I want to know who will represent the county first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9168)|
| 2:32:51| Well, and I don't have the answer for you right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9171)|
| 2:32:54| I think ultimately that's one of the things that we need to weigh in on is how that process would look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9174)|
| 2:33:00| I mean, do we, and I'm just, you asked a question, and I'm not saying I'm right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9180)|
| 2:33:06| but my initial thought was do we pass a resolution, first of all, you've got to pass a resolution authorizing us to hire an attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9186)|
| 2:33:14| Yes, and I think that's where I would like to see a resolution authorizing the county to have legal representation first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9194)|
| 2:33:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9203)|
| 2:33:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9204)|
| 2:33:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9205)|
| 2:33:26| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9206)|
| 2:33:27| Was your light on a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9207)|
| 2:33:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9208)|
| 2:33:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9209)|
| 2:33:30| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9210)|
| 2:33:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9211)|
| 2:33:32| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9212)|
| 2:33:33| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9213)|
| 2:33:37| On these $190,000 in legal fees, I noticed that you didn't provide the names of the attorneys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9217)|
| 2:33:43| that will be receiving this compensation if this is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9223)|
| 2:33:46| Who are they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9226)|
| 2:33:51| The firms of Stephen Garrett, just so that he's correct, his name is Stephen, S-T-E-P-H-E-N-G-A-R-R-E-T-T.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9231)|
| 2:34:02| Herb Bonseer, and then my law firm, Holofield, Janich, Rochelle, and Ferreira, and two of the attorneys that work on these cases, Kelly Mann and Tina Haley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9242)|
| 2:34:09| that are here with me today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9249)|
| 2:34:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9251)|
| 2:34:12| And who's paying the John Valiant's fees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9252)|
| 2:34:18| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9258)|
| 2:34:20| I'm not here on behalf of John Valiant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9260)|
| 2:34:23| So this is just your little group that you want to be compensated for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9263)|
| 2:34:28| This is the group that was hired to defend the uniformed officers that were in the pension plan and sued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9268)|
| 2:34:35| There was eight sued individually as representatives of the class, and then there was the whole class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9275)|
| 2:34:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9282)|
| 2:34:43| And another thing, I take exception when the illusion is that these retired uniformed officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9283)|
| 2:34:52| when they retired from Knox County, were not going to receive, as the voters dictated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9292)|
| 2:34:59| their 75% of their last two years' salary plus every year their 3% cost of living adjustment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9299)|
| 2:35:08| So it was kind of like this big cloud here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9308)|
| 2:35:11| Well, for some reason, some officers are not going to get their retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9311)|
| 2:35:15| That has never, ever, ever been the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9315)|
| 2:35:18| Knox County has funded those retirements, and they'll continue to fund those because that is what the voters decided in 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9318)|
| 2:35:27| So I take exception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9327)|
| 2:35:29| We're talking about this specific additional 43 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9329)|
| 2:35:33| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9333)|
| 2:35:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9334)|
| 2:35:35| And that needs to be foremost and clear to everybody, that this is just an extra 16.8% added on to their 75% retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9335)|
| 2:35:48| I don't know how you got the 16.8%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9348)|
| 2:35:50| I don't know that question, but it is about the 43 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9350)|
| 2:35:53| I don't want to make any misunderstanding about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9353)|
| 2:35:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9356)|
| 2:35:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9358)|
| 2:35:59| The Chair recognizes Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9359)|
| 2:36:02| Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9362)|
| 2:36:03| It's not 16%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9363)|
| 2:36:04| It's a two-year average, and it never says 75%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9364)|
| 2:36:07| It says it's about 8%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9367)|
| 2:36:12| It's more like 13%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9372)|
| 2:36:15| If you take 43 days and divide it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9375)|
| 2:36:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9378)|
| 2:36:19| Commissioners, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9379)|
| 2:36:23| I would like to see your billing records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9383)|
| 2:36:25| I'm not an expert, but I do think if you're going to bring us a resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9385)|
| 2:36:30| it should at least show us that documentation that supports it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9390)|
| 2:36:34| And if that's what the Commission decides and we want to go that route, we'll try to figure that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9394)|
| 2:36:40| We've got issues of attorney-client privilege until the litigation gets resolved, and that's one issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9400)|
| 2:36:45| The second is we thought it would be easier, to be quite honest with you, for the judge, his honor to go do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9405)|
| 2:36:52| who's familiar with where to go do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9412)|
| 2:36:54| I don't have a hesitation about presenting the bills to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9414)|
| 2:36:58| But the normal course of conduct, if you do a class action, is to get his honor to sign off and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9418)|
| 2:37:03| this is the bill, this is reasonable and necessary, and his honor has the expertise to go do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9423)|
| 2:37:10| But, I mean, if you have to, I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9430)|
| 2:37:13| Any objections?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9433)|
| 2:37:16| I certainly want the other two bills to be submitted as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9436)|
| 2:37:20| I'm sorry, Mr. Monser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9440)|
| 2:37:22| He would like for the other two firms' bills to be submitted, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9442)|
| 2:37:25| It would be the totality of the bills submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9445)|
| 2:37:30| Our second purpose of this discussion is to figure out how to hire an attorney to represent us at the 28th hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9450)|
| 2:37:40| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9460)|
| 2:37:41| What are we going to instruct that attorney to do, to fight against paying the bills?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9461)|
| 2:37:46| You know what, I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9466)|
| 2:37:48| I think we probably need to have an executive session with that attorney to review the bills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9468)|
| 2:37:53| And, frankly, it's a matter of advising us on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9473)|
| 2:37:58| I don't pretend to be an expert on billable hours, but I do know that we do have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9478)|
| 2:38:05| and I appreciate y'all's efforts on behalf of our retirees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9485)|
| 2:38:08| but we also have another fiduciary which is just related to reviewing the bills as we appropriate money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9488)|
| 2:38:14| So, when you're having a hearing, we just can't let us not be represented at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9494)|
| 2:38:22| Again, we wind up in a peculiar situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9502)|
| 2:38:25| We're being asked to pay attorneys that we didn't hire for a lawsuit we didn't bring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9505)|
| 2:38:35| That's why we need legal representation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9515)|
| 2:38:43| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9523)|
| 2:38:45| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9525)|
| 2:38:46| I would really, really encourage my colleagues to not re-litigate this case here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9526)|
| 2:38:54| I think that is best left to the courts, and it doesn't do us much good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9534)|
| 2:39:00| I think the most important thing that we can do tonight is make the determination of how we will be legally represented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9540)|
| 2:39:06| and I would be very comfortable in sort of, I don't know how you put it in a legal way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9546)|
| 2:39:12| but I would be comfortable having our chair lead a very, very small group and make that decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9552)|
| 2:39:18| and having this body authorize the chair to determine who will represent us in court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9558)|
| 2:39:24| It is coming up fast on the 28th, and I'd call that an executive committee, whatever you want to call it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9564)|
| 2:39:32| but I think we should move to authorize you and maybe two other members of this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9572)|
| 2:39:39| to determine who will represent us so that we have representation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9579)|
| 2:39:45| I'm not comfortable asking to approve a dollar amount that we saw five minutes ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9585)|
| 2:39:51| I think that is for the judge to decide what is fair and reasonable as, of course, a legal matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9591)|
| 2:39:57| If we're represented properly and the judge then says here is a fair and reasonable way the law is usually done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9597)|
| 2:40:06| that can come back before commission for approval later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9606)|
| 2:40:09| I think we have continued to look at the judge for guidance and have our voice heard but not necessarily be the final voice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9609)|
| 2:40:18| So that would be my recommendation would be to authorize you to pick a very small group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9618)|
| 2:40:24| and determine who will represent us and not approve any particular dollar amount therefore tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9624)|
| 2:40:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9630)|
| 2:40:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9632)|
| 2:40:33| Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9633)|
| 2:40:34| I can do a motion if needed or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9634)|
| 2:40:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9636)|
| 2:40:37| What I'd like to do, I see we've got a couple more lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9637)|
| 2:40:39| I would like to encourage discussion on this important matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9639)|
| 2:40:41| So, Commissioner Bussler, your light was on earlier but then it was off and then Commissioner Biggs came up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9641)|
| 2:40:48| So, Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9648)|
| 2:40:49| Commissioner Bussler can go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9649)|
| 2:40:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9652)|
| 2:40:53| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9653)|
| 2:40:57| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9657)|
| 2:40:59| I'm going to mention something right here, what I just heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9659)|
| 2:41:03| I heard one of our commissioners say, let the courts decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9663)|
| 2:41:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9667)|
| 2:41:08| Yesterday was the 12th where all this would have been decided but this body chose with a vote of seven to one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9668)|
| 2:41:16| to not go that far to find out what the decision was would have been yesterday on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9676)|
| 2:41:23| It's still strange that somebody on this board would say, let the courts decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9683)|
| 2:41:28| When you had that chance yesterday, the courts would have decided how the pension plan was to be funded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9688)|
| 2:41:37| how the pension plan was to be decided, what the individuals would get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9697)|
| 2:41:42| The court would have decided that yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9702)|
| 2:41:46| And now here we are today trying to figure out how to pay lawyers when the courts would have decided yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9706)|
| 2:41:53| But you all decided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9713)|
| 2:41:55| I walked out and said it was illegal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9715)|
| 2:41:58| And here's what you're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9718)|
| 2:42:03| People out there ought to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9723)|
| 2:42:05| When they first started this, there was a bond taken out of $61 million to fund it to make it actuarially sound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9725)|
| 2:42:13| They get 75% plus 3% in 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9733)|
| 2:42:17| If they're making $50,000, 75% of that $50,000 would be $37,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9737)|
| 2:42:22| In 10 years they'll be making $50,000 on their retirement with that additional 3%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9742)|
| 2:42:33| Now you're going to go out to the public and you're going to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9753)|
| 2:42:36| we're going to put another $41 million on the books for the public to fund because we couldn't wait until Monday the 12th to find the ruling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9756)|
| 2:42:49| I can't go back to my constituents and say I'm going to put another $41 million when we've got a $61 million bond that we've set it up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9769)|
| 2:43:01| And we spent $600,000 supposedly on legal fees or legal representation and we said, can't wait three more days to find out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9781)|
| 2:43:13| Now you're asking us to do things at the charter that this was done by referendum by the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9793)|
| 2:43:21| to say that they get that retirement, 75% plus 3%, and somebody changed the rules and added some other details to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9801)|
| 2:43:31| Incorporating, we're supposed to be fiduciary responsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9811)|
| 2:43:35| Somebody wanted to stop that additional fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9815)|
| 2:43:39| I don't know what the answer was, but the judge would have decided yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9819)|
| 2:43:45| And now you come back and say, let's let the judge decide today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9825)|
| 2:43:50| Gosh, I'm going to put this on right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9830)|
| 2:43:53| My item next to it was to decide how the pension budget was going to be funded, how it was going to be calculated on the UOP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9833)|
| 2:44:02| I thought yesterday would have been the day so they could tell us exactly how they do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9842)|
| 2:44:08| But the judge didn't have a chance to rule on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9848)|
| 2:44:11| Now we want him to rule on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9851)|
| 2:44:14| Gosh, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9854)|
| 2:44:16| I don't know what you all want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9856)|
| 2:44:18| I don't know what you think your responsibilities are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9858)|
| 2:44:21| But our responsibility is that tax dollar that we're causing these people to have to fund additional money because we couldn't wait three extra days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9861)|
| 2:44:30| So go ahead and decide how you want to fund it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9870)|
| 2:44:33| I'm not going to be part of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9873)|
| 2:44:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9875)|
| 2:44:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9877)|
| 2:44:38| Mr. Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9878)|
| 2:44:40| I just had a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9880)|
| 2:44:45| Since it's fee offices and everything's broken up and we see how that's going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9885)|
| 2:44:51| who brought this lawsuit to the table and could they not pay it out of their own budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9891)|
| 2:44:57| Who brought the lawsuit to the table?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9897)|
| 2:45:01| It wasn't commissioned, was it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9901)|
| 2:45:04| Is there a specific office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9904)|
| 2:45:05| Although I'm not quite sure I understand your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9905)|
| 2:45:09| Are you saying that the payment for this should come from the law department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9909)|
| 2:45:15| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9915)|
| 2:45:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9916)|
| 2:45:17| Is that feasible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9917)|
| 2:45:23| It was just a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9923)|
| 2:45:24| Was that for legal representation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9924)|
| 2:45:26| Frankly, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9926)|
| 2:45:28| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9928)|
| 2:45:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9929)|
| 2:45:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9930)|
| 2:45:32| Commissioner Jay, you already spoke on this earlier, so Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9932)|
| 2:45:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9938)|
| 2:45:39| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9939)|
| 2:45:41| Yes, I'd like to ask Attorney Homefield to come up since you're involved in all this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9941)|
| 2:45:50| to the remarks that Commissioner Bussler has about any of the calculations and how it came about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9950)|
| 2:46:02| I'd be happy to, and thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9962)|
| 2:46:08| I think you're relying on some information that was given to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9968)|
| 2:46:13| and if you all are willing to do it, if this is your time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9973)|
| 2:46:18| we've got the documents, the actuarial studies that were given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9978)|
| 2:46:22| I will tell you how that number came about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9982)|
| 2:46:25| They took the predicted future liabilities of the pension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9985)|
| 2:46:32| and there's a chart that they put in their briefs for 10 years that showed the $41 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9992)|
| 2:46:38| and you can come up with a little number over $40 million as the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=9998)|
| 2:46:41| and Commissioner Nostrom, you see them, the actuarial reports from USI,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10001)|
| 2:46:46| and then they compared it to the actuarial value of the assets, which is a present value number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10006)|
| 2:46:52| If I was to put it in simple terms to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10012)|
| 2:46:55| if I was to ask each of you to look at your checkbooks today, what's in your checking account,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10015)|
| 2:47:01| and if I was to look 50 years out at your future predicted liabilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10021)|
| 2:47:06| of every household expense you had, college you had, and everything else that was out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10026)|
| 2:47:13| and say, are you fully funded, how many people would pass that test?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10033)|
| 2:47:19| I wouldn't pass that test, right, because that doesn't take into account future contributions or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10039)|
| 2:47:24| They're comparing two numbers that make no sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10044)|
| 2:47:27| Nobody in the employee benefit world that looks at actuaries looks at it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10047)|
| 2:47:33| The same report that you based the $40 million on also says the plan is 98% funded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10053)|
| 2:47:41| and Mr. Nostrom and the people on the Commission Pension Board know this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10061)|
| 2:47:45| and that's been funded that way for every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10065)|
| 2:47:47| If you had the actuaries from USI here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10067)|
| 2:47:51| they would tell you this is one of the better funded governmental plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10071)|
| 2:47:54| and just in 2015 it was over 100% funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10074)|
| 2:47:58| And so if you're going to compare numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10078)|
| 2:48:00| you have to look at the present value number of accrued benefits versus the present value of the benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10080)|
| 2:48:09| The actual assets and the actual numbers when you terminate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10089)|
| 2:48:12| If anybody that looks at a number being projected 40 to 50 years out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10092)|
| 2:48:17| and compare it to a present value number, that's just foolishness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10097)|
| 2:48:25| It makes no sense, and that's what those reports do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10105)|
| 2:48:28| And if you want to go through, I can show you exactly how they added the numbers and how they got there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10108)|
| 2:48:32| but that's not good actuarial science or what makes a plan actuarially sound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10112)|
| 2:48:39| Or to talk about experience losses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10119)|
| 2:48:42| How many people here know what experience loss is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10122)|
| 2:48:45| I don't know what that means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10125)|
| 2:48:47| I mean, it's not terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10127)|
| 2:48:48| It's terms we use if we work with 400 or 500 retirement plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10128)|
| 2:48:52| There's actuarial assumptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10132)|
| 2:48:53| You assume growth rate of mortality, how many people die, what salaries you're going to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10133)|
| 2:48:59| how many people are going to live through retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10139)|
| 2:49:01| All those things are assumptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10141)|
| 2:49:03| If my assumptions are low, in other words, if I get an investment return of 7%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10143)|
| 2:49:08| which is what this plan predicts, and I have an investment return of 4%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10148)|
| 2:49:14| how many people here would still say my assets increased 4%, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10154)|
| 2:49:18| That's math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10158)|
| 2:49:19| That's a constant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10159)|
| 2:49:20| Actuary would say you have a 3% experience loss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10160)|
| 2:49:26| And it would show up as a negative number on the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10166)|
| 2:49:30| And so you can look at that number and say, hey, we've had an experience loss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10170)|
| 2:49:33| This is bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10173)|
| 2:49:34| And that's what was said in the court papers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10174)|
| 2:49:37| That's not necessarily actual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10177)|
| 2:49:39| It's a misunderstanding, potentially a misrepresentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10179)|
| 2:49:45| And people who know this and do this for a living, it's disturbing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10185)|
| 2:49:52| And there's more that we can get into of those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10192)|
| 2:49:55| And I would be happy to sit down at any time you want to and go through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10195)|
| 2:49:59| But on the attorney's fee, those issues, you know, it goes back to we didn't ask specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10199)|
| 2:50:06| Our clients didn't to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10206)|
| 2:50:08| And I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10208)|
| 2:50:09| I mean, and you're talking about there's a great quagmire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10209)|
| 2:50:11| Who is going to represent the interests of Knotts County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10211)|
| 2:50:14| And we do need somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10214)|
| 2:50:16| And what I would prefer to do or have to do is to sit down and maybe even say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10216)|
| 2:50:20| if we could sit down and work it out before we ever go into court here and cut it all off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10220)|
| 2:50:24| I think Mr. Monsier and all of us would be very willing to go do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10224)|
| 2:50:28| Well, let's do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10228)|
| 2:50:31| I've got one other light from Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10231)|
| 2:50:34| I also want to just, as I was thinking through this during this hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10234)|
| 2:50:38| and this is just for the benefit of commissioners and the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10238)|
| 2:50:41| this is kind of related to some of the discussion, not the facts of this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10241)|
| 2:50:44| but some of the discussion matters that were related to this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10244)|
| 2:50:48| One of the discussion points that I recall that the mayor brought up when he addressed this matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10248)|
| 2:50:55| was the mayor's ability to enter into contracts or to sign agreements to work with people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10255)|
| 2:51:00| It would seem we also have in our charter verbiage the effect that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10260)|
| 2:51:06| the law department does have the ability to represent us on legally related items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10266)|
| 2:51:10| except when they're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10270)|
| 2:51:12| And the court has directed the law department not to be involved in this particular case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10272)|
| 2:51:17| as Bud had mentioned earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10277)|
| 2:51:20| And I'm trying to summarize, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10280)|
| 2:51:24| My thoughts are, I wonder, as it relates specifically to this very particular hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10284)|
| 2:51:29| if this might be something that a couple of commissioners could work with the mayor's office on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10289)|
| 2:51:36| to select and hire an attorney to represent the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10296)|
| 2:51:40| and I'm saying this as much for the commissioners as I am to the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10300)|
| 2:51:44| to select and hire an attorney specifically to represent Knox County's interest in this particular matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10304)|
| 2:51:50| and to do so under the county mayor's authority to sign contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10310)|
| 2:51:56| So that seems like an appropriate matter to resolve this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10316)|
| 2:52:05| I'm not talking about who we're going to hire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10325)|
| 2:52:07| I'm talking about the process to hire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10327)|
| 2:52:10| That is the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10330)|
| 2:52:14| So I'm going to ask the mayor if he would like to speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10334)|
| 2:52:32| Certainly I think that would be a good solution, and I would be willing to work with the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10352)|
| 2:52:37| and be honored to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10357)|
| 2:52:38| So I think that's a viable option that you would have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10358)|
| 2:52:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10361)|
| 2:52:42| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10362)|
| 2:52:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10363)|
| 2:52:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10364)|
| 2:52:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10365)|
| 2:52:46| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10366)|
| 2:52:49| I got real passionate over this issue because of one thing and one thing only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10369)|
| 2:52:55| We're not talking about our money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10375)|
| 2:52:57| We're talking about taxpayers out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10377)|
| 2:53:00| You're talking about taxpayers that work outside the government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10380)|
| 2:53:06| When I get paid from the taxpayers over a little bit that I get here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10386)|
| 2:53:12| and I pay somebody else that money, and I pay taxes on that money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10392)|
| 2:53:18| I'm using taxpayers' money to do that with what I get here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10398)|
| 2:53:23| The only people that really pay taxes is in the private sector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10403)|
| 2:53:29| and that's their money that funds us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10409)|
| 2:53:31| So I want to protect their money as much as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10411)|
| 2:53:34| I think that the UOP should be funded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10414)|
| 2:53:38| but as it is written in what is written in the books exactly how that's being funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10418)|
| 2:53:46| Now, some people we have an appointed body that decides to go around that referendum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10426)|
| 2:53:53| that the people voted on is what I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10433)|
| 2:53:58| And yet we approved that appointed body to change that referendum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10438)|
| 2:54:05| I don't think that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10445)|
| 2:54:08| We should support and protect the taxpayers' dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10448)|
| 2:54:11| and we're not doing that here in what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10451)|
| 2:54:15| And I just want to let you all know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10455)|
| 2:54:18| And again, I walked out because I thought it was illegal the other day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10458)|
| 2:54:23| and I think what we're doing right now is illegal because we're not following the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10463)|
| 2:54:30| So do your whatever you want to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10470)|
| 2:54:32| but I'm not going to be part of the situation that goes against the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10472)|
| 2:54:39| And that's what you all are doing is going against the charter right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10479)|
| 2:54:44| So, hey, have at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10484)|
| 2:54:45| I'm out of here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10485)|
| 2:54:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10487)|
| 2:54:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10489)|
| 2:54:50| Commissioner Jay, you had your light on, and then I'm going to call on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10490)|
| 2:54:52| This is just my final comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10492)|
| 2:54:56| If I understand it right now, what's before this body is item number 55 in the workshop session to set the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10496)|
| 2:55:05| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10505)|
| 2:55:12| Do we skip that altogether and go right to just discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10512)|
| 2:55:17| We added it earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10517)|
| 2:55:19| We added it to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10519)|
| 2:55:20| And we've worked our way through the agenda to item 55.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10520)|
| 2:55:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10522)|
| 2:55:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10523)|
| 2:55:24| I'd like to just simply make a motion to authorize the committee chairman to work with the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10524)|
| 2:55:28| and his team to determine who will represent Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10528)|
| 2:55:32| They can together then work with that attorney to either work on an agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10532)|
| 2:55:38| or if they cannot come up with an agreement, work with the judge at the hearing set for the 28th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10538)|
| 2:55:43| But I'd like to make a motion to authorize the commission chair to work with the mayor to determine who will represent Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10543)|
| 2:55:49| And I think Knox County should be represented in some form or fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10549)|
| 2:55:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10553)|
| 2:55:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10554)|
| 2:55:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10555)|
| 2:55:58| We've got more lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10558)|
| 2:55:59| Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10559)|
| 2:56:00| Since the 7th district no longer has representation and I live in that district, I'd like to be on that panel as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10560)|
| 2:56:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10567)|
| 2:56:08| I also want to clarify kind of a point of order, just on Robert's rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10568)|
| 2:56:12| This was a discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10572)|
| 2:56:15| We didn't have a formal item attached to this to vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10575)|
| 2:56:20| Just wanted to clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10580)|
| 2:56:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10582)|
| 2:56:23| Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10583)|
| 2:56:24| Another point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10584)|
| 2:56:25| Point of order here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10585)|
| 2:56:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10586)|
| 2:56:27| I want to get clarification on what we would be voting on on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10587)|
| 2:56:33| If it came up as a discussion item, so we've got a discussion regarding a motion that's been filed for attorney fees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10593)|
| 2:56:41| in Knox County versus Knox County Retirement and Pension Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10601)|
| 2:56:44| It's a motion to include legal representation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10604)|
| 2:56:46| So, you know, what can we do here to kind of get this resolved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10606)|
| 2:56:50| That's what I just want to get some clarification on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10610)|
| 2:56:52| I'll ask the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10612)|
| 2:56:53| I think what we need to do is just have a discussion on the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10613)|
| 2:56:56| And then at next Monday's meeting, we need to add something to the agenda to address it at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10616)|
| 2:57:01| That's my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10621)|
| 2:57:02| That's why I brought it in as a discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10622)|
| 2:57:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10623)|
| 2:57:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10624)|
| 2:57:05| Go ahead, buddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10625)|
| 2:57:08| There's two procedural ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10628)|
| 2:57:10| Commissioner Smith gave you an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10630)|
| 2:57:13| The other one is you can make a motion to add to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10633)|
| 2:57:18| You can add to the agenda the motion that you have tonight if you want to add it to the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10638)|
| 2:57:24| and prepare a resolution for a final vote next week by a two-thirds vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10644)|
| 2:57:32| You can add Mr. J's when he doesn't have a motion right now because he doesn't have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10652)|
| 2:57:38| But theoretically, if you wanted to put together this committee and you want to have a resolution ready,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10658)|
| 2:57:46| you can actually add it tonight by amending the agenda with eight votes, then make the motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10666)|
| 2:57:54| add that to the agenda, then vote it forward one way or the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10674)|
| 2:57:58| and we can have a resolution prepared for you to vote on final by next week procedurally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10678)|
| 2:58:06| Otherwise, you can add it next week and prepare something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10686)|
| 2:58:11| It's either now or next week, and you can still accomplish what you want is what I'm trying to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10691)|
| 2:58:16| But it will have to be added either way because it was a discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10696)|
| 2:58:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10701)|
| 2:58:25| You can do it, but you can't do it with official resolution from the board unless you do it tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10705)|
| 2:58:30| That's what I'm trying to get to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10710)|
| 2:58:33| If you want to accomplish something between now and the 28th, and if you want to start tomorrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10713)|
| 2:58:40| then you need to have a resolution to do it tonight, whereby you can vote on it to send it forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10720)|
| 2:58:47| but then you'll have something whereby you can actually start to work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10727)|
| 2:58:53| but you will finalize it next Monday with a vote, just like any other thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10733)|
| 2:58:58| This is just the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10738)|
| 2:58:59| Right, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10739)|
| 2:59:00| So you don't have a special call meeting, but what I'm saying is you can get it on your agenda either tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10740)|
| 2:59:05| or next Monday with a add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10745)|
| 2:59:10| You have to add it to your agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10750)|
| 2:59:12| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10752)|
| 2:59:13| And then have a resolution to vote on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10753)|
| 2:59:15| and you can prepare something to be added on next week would probably be the best way to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10755)|
| 2:59:22| and then add it to the agenda next week and vote on it next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10762)|
| 2:59:25| And if you have a feel, Chairman, that the board is going to go with the subcommittee and the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10765)|
| 2:59:32| you may want to start that process informally, trying to rely on the vote of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10772)|
| 2:59:39| Got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10779)|
| 2:59:40| Can I make a point of order on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10780)|
| 2:59:43| I think having a subcommittee is a bad idea because you've got to do legal notice, public notice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10783)|
| 2:59:49| and all that stuff for this meeting that you're going to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10789)|
| 2:59:52| You just appoint the chair in your resolution coming up next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10792)|
| 2:59:56| Appoint the chair to work with the mayor's office to find representation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10796)|
| 2:59:59| through contracted professional services to represent the county is the right route to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10799)|
| 3:00:04| And I think we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10804)|
| 3:00:05| That's a generic resolution that can be added on Monday, and we can get the ball rolling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10805)|
| 3:00:10| But you can go ahead and meet with the mayor's office and have that discussion ahead of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10810)|
| 3:00:13| But adding one or two more commissioners to it just makes it worse on the notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10813)|
| 3:00:20| You limit the ability to be expedient in this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10820)|
| 3:00:23| Okay. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10823)|
| 3:00:25| Commissioner Carringer, your line is still on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10825)|
| 3:00:27| Yeah, I had just one clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10827)|
| 3:00:30| If I heard Commissioner Boesler right, he said we could have waited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10830)|
| 3:00:34| and gotten a ruling yesterday by Chancellor Weaver if we had not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10834)|
| 3:00:39| Well, correct me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10839)|
| 3:00:41| I mean, we did get a ruling from Chancellor Weaver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10841)|
| 3:00:46| And so for that, and then Mr. Holenfeld was back up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10846)|
| 3:00:51| and I just didn't know if you had anything that you needed to add| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10851)|
| 3:00:54| or just wanted to make sure you were okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10854)|
| 3:01:00| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10860)|
| 3:01:01| All right. Commissioner Smith, and now I want to kind of get a resolution done on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10861)|
| 3:01:05| All right. Go ahead, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10865)|
| 3:01:07| I just wanted to add to that comment by Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10867)|
| 3:01:10| Yes, we could have possibly had a ruling yesterday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10870)|
| 3:01:14| but with any ruling there's also the opportunity to appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10874)|
| 3:01:18| This thing could keep going on forever and ever and ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10878)|
| 3:01:24| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10884)|
| 3:01:26| Trying to read the room, what the chair would like to entertain would be a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10886)|
| 3:01:32| which reflects the sentiments of both Commissioner Jay and Commissioner Anders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10892)|
| 3:01:37| to the effect of passing a resolution for the chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10897)|
| 3:01:41| if this body so deems it to work with the mayor's office to begin the process tomorrow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10901)|
| 3:01:47| of finding an attorney on this matter and then try to get the resolution passed next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10907)|
| 3:01:54| The proper way, if I'm hearing this correctly, would be to do a formal, to make the motion to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10914)|
| 3:02:00| and then the motion specifically would be to add it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10920)|
| 3:02:03| I would add it Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10923)|
| 3:02:05| I think the general consensus of the body is to go ahead and start the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10925)|
| 3:02:11| and then bring a resolution Monday authorizing the chairman and the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10931)|
| 3:02:15| to execute a contract with an attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10935)|
| 3:02:18| And then add it on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10938)|
| 3:02:21| If that's the will of this body, I'm kind of looking around, I'm seeing some heads nod.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10941)|
| 3:02:25| Is there any more discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10945)|
| 3:02:31| Okay, moving on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10951)|
| 3:02:36| All right, Madam Chair, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10956)|
| 3:02:42| Discussion item regarding retirement and pension board's calculations under the UOP program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10962)|
| 3:02:52| I'm going to, is there, regarding item 56 that was originally put on the agenda by Commissioner Busler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10972)|
| 3:02:58| is there any other additional discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10978)|
| 3:03:01| Defer it until next week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10981)|
| 3:03:02| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10982)|
| 3:03:03| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10983)|
| 3:03:04| He walked out on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10984)|
| 3:03:05| Walked out two meetings in a row and expect us to come back to you every time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10985)|
| 3:03:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10989)|
| 3:03:10| Well, seeing none, we'll move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10990)|
| 3:03:14| Okay, public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10994)|
| 3:03:18| We had, is there anybody who would like to speak at public forum to commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=10998)|
| 3:03:24| I believe we may have had one person earlier who did not show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11004)|
| 3:03:28| Was that Sandra?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11008)|
| 3:03:31| Is Sandra here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11011)|
| 3:03:35| I think that ends it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11015)|
| 3:03:37| What I'd like to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11017)|
| 3:03:38| Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11018)|
| 3:03:39| I'm sorry, what was that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11019)|
| 3:03:45| Okay, we do have a few other ads just to formally add them here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11025)|
| 3:03:50| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11030)|
| 3:03:52| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11032)|
| 3:03:53| Mr. Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11033)|
| 3:03:54| I do have Dr. Edwards here that was, has shown up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11034)|
| 3:03:58| And if Dr. Edwards would like to speak, I would like to give him his five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11038)|
| 3:04:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11041)|
| 3:04:02| If that's possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11042)|
| 3:04:04| Yeah, the other things that were on here, which, I'll tell you what, if you don't mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11044)|
| 3:04:09| can we get the housekeeping knocked out real quick and then we'll come back to him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11049)|
| 3:04:12| I know that's somewhat out of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11052)|
| 3:04:14| Sure, that's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11054)|
| 3:04:15| But we've got the honorary resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11055)|
| 3:04:17| We've got the spread of record for Commissioner Wright, the honorary resolution for Commissioner Wright,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11057)|
| 3:04:22| and the dates for the public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11062)|
| 3:04:25| So those are three things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11065)|
| 3:04:27| And thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11067)|
| 3:04:28| Madam Clerk reminded me of those because we added them earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11068)|
| 3:04:31| So what I'd like to do is get those three housekeeping matters taken care of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11071)|
| 3:04:36| and then we will move on to public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11076)|
| 3:04:38| I'm glad that you're here, and I apologize that the meeting's gone on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11078)|
| 3:04:41| but we're going to go ahead and knock these three things out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11081)|
| 3:04:44| The first thing that I'd like to get in motion to probably send forward to approval next week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11084)|
| 3:04:51| is the spread of record for Commissioner Wright's resignation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11091)|
| 3:04:55| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11095)|
| 3:04:56| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11096)|
| 3:04:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11097)|
| 3:04:58| Do we still have a quorum here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11098)|
| 3:05:02| We've got seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11102)|
| 3:05:03| Seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11103)|
| 3:05:04| Yeah, Randy's right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11104)|
| 3:05:05| Yeah, okay, there's Randy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11105)|
| 3:05:06| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11106)|
| 3:05:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11107)|
| 3:05:08| Who made the motion on that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11108)|
| 3:05:11| All right, that was Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11111)|
| 3:05:12| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11112)|
| 3:05:13| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11113)|
| 3:05:17| Did we do this earlier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11117)|
| 3:05:20| It was added to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11120)|
| 3:05:21| I've just gotten on to them, and we didn't put them on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11121)|
| 3:05:25| So I'll tell you what we could do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11125)|
| 3:05:28| Let's take items number one and two, which is, excuse me, those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11128)|
| 3:05:34| I'm not sure what you've got them numbered on, Madam Clerk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11134)|
| 3:05:36| but the spread of record for Commissioner Wright| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11136)|
| 3:05:39| and the honorary resolution for Commissioner Wright,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11139)|
| 3:05:41| both of those need to just be moved forward to next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11141)|
| 3:05:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11145)|
| 3:05:46| The item three are dates for the public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11146)|
| 3:05:49| We can approve that next week and discuss it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11149)|
| 3:05:53| but I will say this for the purpose of this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11153)|
| 3:05:56| We felt that Commissioner Wright was probably going to win his election for some time now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11156)|
| 3:06:01| I think the public might know that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11161)|
| 3:06:03| but I believe that it's reasonable to try and get that appointment done in December,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11163)|
| 3:06:08| to have the candidates interview after the work session in December with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11168)|
| 3:06:14| It will give us time to get this posted and then to have the vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11174)|
| 3:06:17| during the regularly scheduled commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11177)|
| 3:06:20| Mr. Law Director, would we need to have a specially called meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11180)|
| 3:06:26| Previously what you did was just do a special called meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11186)|
| 3:06:29| where each candidate got to be interviewed for five minutes by the body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11189)|
| 3:06:34| and then the selection was made at the end of the interview,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11194)|
| 3:06:37| very similar to what you did to the ethics appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11197)|
| 3:06:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11200)|
| 3:06:41| I know that very clearly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11201)|
| 3:06:43| Well, the ethics folks came in for a work session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11203)|
| 3:06:46| and then we voted on it the next week, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11206)|
| 3:06:48| And I think we ought to, whoever we appoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11208)|
| 3:06:51| we should, if we appoint them at workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11211)|
| 3:06:54| to give them at least a week before the December meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11214)|
| 3:06:58| Previously when someone was added to this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11218)|
| 3:07:04| You're speaking from first-hand experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11224)|
| 3:07:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11226)|
| 3:07:07| What it was is basically they did it on the 12th of January| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11227)|
| 3:07:10| so that you had a week before the work session, and then you were ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11230)|
| 3:07:16| So I think that's better for the individual that you do it the week prior to the work session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11236)|
| 3:07:21| to get them ready to road, get them ready, plus acclimated with our other county personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11241)|
| 3:07:27| And I guess from a timing, we can figure out the week to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11247)|
| 3:07:31| My point is I'd like to get it done in December just so that we can have this person sworn in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11251)|
| 3:07:36| and can start helping us in December and January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11256)|
| 3:07:39| That's my whole point is we can figure out, I'll work with getting these dates done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11259)|
| 3:07:44| I would rather not have it linger to January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11264)|
| 3:07:47| I would rather see it get done in December,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11267)|
| 3:07:51| and I'll work with the law department and the commission office to get all the public notices placed out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11271)|
| 3:07:56| and try to get some appropriate dates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11276)|
| 3:07:58| All of this will be emailed to you all and posted in the form for commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11278)|
| 3:08:02| We don't need to let 8th District go two months without a representative. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11282)|
| 3:08:08| So with all that said, now I'll move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11288)|
| 3:08:11| Is there anything else, Mrs. Clerk, that I need to go over?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11291)|
| 3:08:15| Now we're down to public forum, our last public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11295)|
| 3:08:19| Okay. Go ahead, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11299)|
| 3:08:26| Thank you, John Edwards, Knoxville 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11306)|
| 3:08:34| As I am, I'm hungry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11314)|
| 3:08:37| But there's just one thing that I wanted to bring up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11317)|
| 3:08:40| I think we as a group with Knoxville BMX, who worked on this project for six-plus years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11320)|
| 3:08:48| have a lot of time invested in this, and we feel like the cost estimate that's come in for the track| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11328)|
| 3:08:55| is inconsistent with what we've seen throughout the region as far as cost on tracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11335)|
| 3:09:04| And that concerns us as citizens stepping out of our shoes as BMX.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11344)|
| 3:09:10| I don't want my money wasted either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11350)|
| 3:09:13| So we'd like to propose that instead of making a decision on the track,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11353)|
| 3:09:19| that we step back and take a look at what these costs are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11359)|
| 3:09:23| I've already spoken with USA BMX about the cost estimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11363)|
| 3:09:27| I've spoken with the engineers that designed the track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11367)|
| 3:09:31| The engineer costs on that track $750,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11371)|
| 3:09:35| There's a very similar sister track, which our track was designed after in Powder Springs, Georgia,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11375)|
| 3:09:42| that was built with no infrastructure, no lights, for $850,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11382)|
| 3:09:49| So we don't think it's anyone's fault, but we would like to have Commission take a look at those numbers a little more closely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11389)|
| 3:09:59| to see if we can't get that number to where it's more reasonable to things that have gone on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11399)|
| 3:10:06| We've got full support of USA BMX, and we feel like we can have them provide numbers from around the region| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11406)|
| 3:10:15| of similar facilities that have been built for much less money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11415)|
| 3:10:20| So that's kind of what I would like to propose to you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11420)|
| 3:10:25| so that we make sure that we can hopefully provide something to the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11425)|
| 3:10:31| that's going to be impactful to our economy and our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11431)|
| 3:10:35| But we also want to make sure it's cost effective, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11435)|
| 3:10:39| So I think that's pretty much all I'll have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11439)|
| 3:10:47| All right. Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11447)|
| 3:10:50| Commissioner Biggs, Mr. Edwards, is there by any chance, so I came out to South Dool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11450)|
| 3:10:56| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11456)|
| 3:10:57| Is there any chance that you could give the commissioners that weren't there a copy of your slides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11457)|
| 3:11:02| or maybe your presentation so they could take a look into it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11462)|
| 3:11:05| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11465)|
| 3:11:06| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11466)|
| 3:11:07| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11467)|
| 3:11:08| Okay. Thank you. I see we've got a couple other lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11468)|
| 3:11:11| If you recall, we have one public ordinance reading that we have to do after the conclusion of this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11471)|
| 3:11:19| But I recognize Commissioner Smith and then Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11479)|
| 3:11:26| Director Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11486)|
| 3:11:31| The numbers we received tonight, they came back through the bid process, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11491)|
| 3:11:40| Yes, it would have been a construction estimate that came from DNARC Construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11500)|
| 3:11:44| DNARC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11504)|
| 3:11:46| Did any of the BMX certified track builders submit bids?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11506)|
| 3:11:58| I don't know that answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11518)|
| 3:11:59| I know DNARC is on the list of companies that we have contracts with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11519)|
| 3:12:06| I don't know that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11526)|
| 3:12:09| The process was open to anybody to bid though, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11529)|
| 3:12:15| That may be a question for Matt Myers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11535)|
| 3:12:18| Actually, it's through PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11538)|
| 3:12:20| It's not through procurement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11540)|
| 3:12:23| It's through PBA because we turned that project over to PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11543)|
| 3:12:27| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11547)|
| 3:12:29| All right. Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11549)|
| 3:12:32| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11552)|
| 3:12:33| I just wanted to thank the folks from the BMX track for hanging in here until after 8 o'clock at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11553)|
| 3:12:40| That's very impressive, and I admire you for hanging in there to the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11560)|
| 3:12:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11565)|
| 3:12:48| All right. Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11568)|
| 3:12:50| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11570)|
| 3:12:51| Real quickly, Mr. Smith brings up a lot of good points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11571)|
| 3:12:55| I wanted to ask PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11575)|
| 3:12:57| My understanding is that no BMX facility track builder was invited to participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11577)|
| 3:13:05| Can I clarify one thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11585)|
| 3:13:07| It's not out for bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11587)|
| 3:13:09| It's a contract estimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11589)|
| 3:13:11| We have companies on retainer to do contract estimates before we put anything out to bid, and that's what that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11591)|
| 3:13:20| We may need to back up and get actual RFQs so we really know what the numbers are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11600)|
| 3:13:26| These numbers are not jibing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11606)|
| 3:13:29| I've got a lot of questions for PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=11609)|
