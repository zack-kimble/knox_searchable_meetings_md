| 2:35:53| if necessary, reconsider those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9353)|
| 2:35:55| And then if there's a student who receives speech services who brings in a note from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9355)|
| 2:36:00| a health care provider, then those would also be individually considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9360)|
| 2:36:08| Miss Babb?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9368)|
| 2:36:10| This is probably a staff question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9370)|
| 2:36:12| If we could have a little...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9372)|
| 2:36:14| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9374)|
| 2:36:15| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9375)|
| 2:36:16| Yes, I second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9376)|
| 2:36:17| You did?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9377)|
| 2:36:18| Okay, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9378)|
| 2:36:19| Is there a staff member to sort of explain how the exemptions have been going and how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9379)|
| 2:36:23| we've chosen who to exempt and not exempt, just so that I understand the process better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9383)|
| 2:36:28| before we decide on voting on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9388)|
| 2:36:30| Sorry, Mr. Myers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9390)|
| 2:36:38| Well, thank you so much, Miss Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9398)|
| 2:36:40| So, you know, in terms of the interpretation of the order from Judge Greer, what was asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9400)|
| 2:36:48| of us as a staff in working with the law department, we felt the most manageable thing to do was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9408)|
| 2:36:53| to build it into structures that already exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9413)|
| 2:36:56| Right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9416)|
| 2:36:57| It's structures that our school-based staff understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9417)|
| 2:36:59| It's structures that student support staff understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9419)|
| 2:37:01| So, that's why we used the S-Team process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9421)|
| 2:37:04| And then looking at eligibility under Section 504.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9424)|
| 2:37:07| And then, of course, eligibility under the IDEA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9427)|
| 2:37:10| Which means, essentially, no one person makes that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9430)|
| 2:37:15| Right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9435)|
| 2:37:16| Because decisions surrounding a 504 or an IEP are team-based decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9436)|
| 2:37:20| Right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9440)|
| 2:37:21| So, we look at students comprehensively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9441)|
| 2:37:23| So, for example, if it's a student with a 504 with a diagnosis of asthma, we're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9443)|
| 2:37:29| to include one of our nurses on that team to be part of that decision as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9449)|
| 2:37:34| So, no one person owns any of those decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9454)|
| 2:37:39| And in terms of revisiting the exemptions or accommodations around masking, any family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9459)|
| 2:37:47| who has a student with a 504 or an IEP can request a meeting at any time to revisit what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9467)|
| 2:37:54| accommodations are present in those two plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9474)|
| 2:37:58| And if families also have the opportunity to file a grievance if they're not satisfied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9478)|
| 2:38:03| with their 504, they can file that grievance first to my office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9483)|
| 2:38:09| And after I view it, if they're still dissatisfied, they can grieve further to Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9489)|
| 2:38:15| And if they're still not satisfied, then they could grieve to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9495)|
| 2:38:20| Obviously, under the IDEA, families have the right to file due process if they don't agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9500)|
| 2:38:25| with their IEP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9505)|
| 2:38:26| So, there are multiple avenues for families to explore to try and get whatever the appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9506)|
| 2:38:32| accommodation for their student may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9512)|
| 2:38:35| Right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9515)|
| 2:38:36| So, we have, I believe, 375 students, which I don't believe it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9516)|
| 2:38:42| I know it because that's a pretty precise number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9522)|
| 2:38:44| So, that must be the number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9524)|
| 2:38:46| 375 students that receive some sort of masking accommodation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9526)|
| 2:38:51| Most of those are full exemptions that have been granted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9531)|
| 2:38:55| In addition to that, we have, I think it's 150, approximately 150 staff who also have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9535)|
| 2:39:05| masking accommodations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9545)|
| 2:39:06| Again, most of those are full exemptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9546)|
| 2:39:09| Some of the staffing masking accommodations are actually specifically related to the types| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9549)|
| 2:39:15| of students that those staff work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9555)|
| 2:39:17| So, for example, many of our speech language pathologists use face shields and social distancing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9557)|
| 2:39:23| when working with students and when they're working directly with students to provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9563)|
| 2:39:27| those speech services and things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9567)|
| 2:39:29| So, I think that we're definitely, you know, our team is trying to manage those requests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9569)|
| 2:39:35| as best we can in line with the recommendations and interpretations of Judge Greer's order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9575)|
| 2:39:42| And again, the goal being to build these processes into things that we already know how to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9582)|
| 2:39:48| Our principals and school staff know how to run an S-team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9588)|
| 2:39:51| They know how to have a 504 meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9591)|
| 2:39:52| They know how to have an IEP meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9592)|
| 2:39:54| Right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9594)|
| 2:39:55| So, we've tried to build these into pre-existing structures so that we could operate as efficiently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9595)|
| 2:40:02| as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9602)|
| 2:40:03| Because certainly, as you can imagine, when this order first came down and we laid out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9603)|
| 2:40:07| what the plan was going to be, there were an awful lot of requests for S-teams and 504| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9607)|
| 2:40:11| meetings and IEP meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9611)|
| 2:40:14| I guess my concern with, and it's not that I'm against what Ms. Owens is suggesting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9614)|
| 2:40:20| it just sounds like after hearing what you're saying, there's probably been a lot of review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9620)|
| 2:40:25| that there's probably not going to be a lot of change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9625)|
| 2:40:28| So, what I'm wondering is, is it maybe there are further exemptions that would help some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9628)|
| 2:40:36| of these families get exemptions that we're sort of seeing feel like need them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9636)|
| 2:40:40| And obviously, we don't know if Judge Greer would do them, but would that help your office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9640)|
| 2:40:44| some if it was broadened what some of the exemptions were?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9644)|
| 2:40:49| And that's where I don't know enough about what the order says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9649)|
| 2:40:53| So, currently, when the judge first passed the order, he gave us two exemptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9653)|
| 2:40:59| It was students with tracheotomies and I think it was students with autism, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9659)|
| 2:41:03| We no longer have a list of quote unquote approved exemptions, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9663)|
| 2:41:08| He put it back into the hands of school personnel to make those decisions within the frameworks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9668)|
| 2:41:13| provided under Section 504 and the IDEA, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9673)|
| 2:41:18| So, theoretically, no one can show up and just say, hey, I have X diagnosis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9678)|
| 2:41:23| Give me my mask exemption, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9683)|
| 2:41:25| How it works is you bring this information in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9685)|
| 2:41:29| The team determines whether or not you're eligible for services and accommodations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9689)|
| 2:41:33| under Section 504 or the IDEA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9693)|
| 2:41:36| And then the teams decide what's an appropriate accommodation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9696)|
| 2:41:40| And an appropriate accommodation in 375 of those cases has been, and many of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9700)|
| 2:41:46| full mask exemptions, some of them it's mask breaks, some of them it's a face shield, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9706)|
| 2:41:51| So, those teams decide what the appropriate accommodation is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9711)|
| 2:41:54| I guess what I would say to the internal review and those things is those avenues already exist, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9714)|
| 2:42:00| If a family wants to review their accommodations under Section 504 or the IDEA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9720)|
| 2:42:06| they need but request a meeting and we'll hold a meeting within a reasonable amount of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9726)|
| 2:42:12| under Section 504 and within 10 days under the IDEA to revisit those plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9732)|
| 2:42:21| And they can also still file a grievance under Section 504 also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9741)|
| 2:42:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9746)|
| 2:42:27| So, I guess in light of that and what you've told us, from what Ms. Owens has proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9747)|
| 2:42:35| there's probably not a big difference on what we're already doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9755)|
| 2:42:37| Is there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9757)|
| 2:42:40| From my perspective, there is not a big difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9760)|
| 2:42:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9763)|
| 2:42:44| Except for my interpretation of what Ms. Owens is asking would be that we go in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9764)|
| 2:42:52| and reevaluate every single request for mask accommodations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9772)|
| 2:42:56| versus if a family has an issue with their established mask accommodations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9776)|
| 2:43:01| they call us and schedule a meeting and we revisit the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9781)|
| 2:43:07| I would be glad to amend that if we need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9787)|
| 2:43:14| Ms. Vance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9794)|
| 2:43:15| So, Jason, if a family just met with a principal and they were denied an exemption,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9795)|
| 2:43:22| should they have requested an S-team or had an S-team or in the beginning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9802)|
| 2:43:28| were we just principals meeting with them and making their own decisions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9808)|
| 2:43:33| That's a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9813)|
| 2:43:35| So, no, that should not be happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9815)|
| 2:43:37| I think I responded to a parent about that exact same concern this morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9817)|
| 2:43:43| and one of my department supervisors is going to reach out to that parent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9823)|
| 2:43:47| if they've not already, today, tomorrow, to shore that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9827)|
| 2:43:50| Again, no one person should be making the decision about masking accommodations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9830)|
| 2:43:55| And I know you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9835)|
| 2:43:57| It's a team decision from the very beginning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9837)|
| 2:44:02| whether we're looking at the eligibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9842)|
| 2:44:03| or what the individualized plan for a student is going to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9843)|
| 2:44:06| it is going to be a team decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9846)|
| 2:44:08| So, in that case, those parents that were denied an exemption| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9848)|
| 2:44:13| based on a principal making that decision might want to come back and request an S-team?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9853)|
| 2:44:18| I would definitely encourage them to request an S-team, yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9858)|
| 2:44:22| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9862)|
| 2:44:27| Okay. So, Ms. Coatney, would you like to restate Ms. Owen's motion or Ms. Owen's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9867)|
| 2:44:41| Mr. Dupler, in your opinion, do we need this motion, if this is already being done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9881)|
| 2:44:46| or have we now communicated better with the public so that it's no longer necessary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9886)|
| 2:44:56| I think that's what Mr. Myers said, but what I heard him say was that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9896)|
| 2:45:02| if the board wants to pass this motion, then the administration would take another look at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9902)|
| 2:45:08| and parents wouldn't have to reapply or apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9908)|
| 2:45:13| But I think he's also telling us that's an exorbitant number, right, potentially?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9913)|
| 2:45:20| Mr. Myers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9920)|
| 2:45:23| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9923)|
| 2:45:27| I'm going to need you to repeat that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9927)|
| 2:45:29| Okay. My question is, have we now, instead of this motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9929)|
| 2:45:34| have we now clearly communicated with parents so that this motion is no longer necessary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9934)|
| 2:45:40| or should we keep this motion and direct the staff to do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9940)|
| 2:45:47| Is it going to be an excessive amount of extra work to duplicate something you've already done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9947)|
| 2:45:56| I think that my recommendation would be that we let the processes we have continue to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9956)|
| 2:46:04| We can certainly send out an update to our own staff, just as a friendly reminder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9964)|
| 2:46:09| that if you're getting mask requests and maybe a parent doesn't know the right thing to call the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9969)|
| 2:46:15| that we're saying, hey, okay, let's have an S-team and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9975)|
| 2:46:18| But I think that we already have processes in place to address parental concerns surrounding those plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9978)|
| 2:46:26| Great. Thank you, Mr. Myers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9986)|
| 2:46:28| Madam Chair, I withdraw the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9988)|
| 2:46:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9990)|
| 2:46:34| Okay, so moving forward, did we have other motions that we wanted considered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=9994)|
| 2:46:42| Ms. Bounds or Ms. Horn? Ms. Bounds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10002)|
| 2:46:47| Terri, do you have that, or do I need to pull it up and read it again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10007)|
| 2:46:53| You might find it quicker than I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10013)|
| 2:46:59| Okay, I've got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10019)|
| 2:47:02| So I make a motion that the Knox County Board of Education will not agree to the appointment of a neutral monitor for schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10022)|
| 2:47:17| will not submit a compliance plan as stated by the plaintiffs, and will not agree to a three-person compliance committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10037)|
| 2:47:24| So that is my recommendation, and the board would direct the law department to act in accordance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10044)|
| 2:47:32| So a motion by Ms. Bounds, a second by Ms. Horn. Any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10052)|
| 2:47:38| I have a clarifying question on the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10058)|
| 2:47:41| Yes, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10061)|
| 2:47:43| Ms. Bounds, when you say neutral, can you define what you mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10063)|
| 2:47:47| I believe that is the term the plaintiffs used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10067)|
| 2:47:51| Well, I guess what I'm asking is, do you mean explicitly third-party monitors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10071)|
| 2:47:56| Do you mean any monitor at all? I guess that's what I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10076)|
| 2:48:00| Well, I think the way I read their demands, a neutral monitor could be a third party,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10080)|
| 2:48:10| but the compliance plan also indicated that they would like a monitor in every school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10090)|
| 2:48:17| And they did not specify, I guess, that could be a teacher or someone in the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10097)|
| 2:48:23| So I think the neutral monitor was more of a third-party person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10103)|
| 2:48:28| But you would probably have to ask the plaintiffs, because I'm not sure this is their wording.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10108)|
| 2:48:34| Thank you. I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10114)|
| 2:48:37| Thank you. I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10117)|
| 2:48:40| I spoke to some of my schools this week, and also just thinking through the logistics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10120)|
| 2:48:45| I agree that any kind of third-party monitoring is going to be fairly difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10125)|
| 2:48:49| I don't know that—I hate the ordering of the motions in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10129)|
| 2:48:54| I don't know that I want to support this only because I think if we go into negotiation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10134)|
| 2:48:59| if Ms. Babb's motion is approved, I think it could hurt any point in negotiation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10139)|
| 2:49:05| But thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10145)|
| 2:49:07| Can I respond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10147)|
| 2:49:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10149)|
| 2:49:10| Thank you, Ms. Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10150)|
| 2:49:12| It possibly could, but I think it also lets them know where we stand on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10152)|
| 2:49:17| And I think a third party could be with a lot of legal issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10157)|
| 2:49:25| and I think it's not fair to ask, even if they volunteer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10165)|
| 2:49:30| any staff member whose job is educating children to be a monitor and report back to the judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10170)|
| 2:49:37| So I think this is a motion that I'm willing to stand on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10177)|
| 2:49:43| and whatever the consequences may be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10183)|
| 2:49:46| because I don't think that is a good message to send to our teachers and students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10186)|
| 2:49:52| that they're being watched constantly and they don't know when.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10192)|
| 2:49:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10196)|
| 2:50:00| And I will just weigh in on that, too, Ms. Bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10200)|
| 2:50:03| I mean, and I've said it before, we don't have the staff as it is to monitor—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10203)|
| 2:50:11| I mean, we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10211)|
| 2:50:13| I mean, we don't have subs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10213)|
| 2:50:14| We don't have custodians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10214)|
| 2:50:15| We've heard it said time and time again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10215)|
| 2:50:19| We just don't have the staff, and a lot of it's because of this mask mandate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10219)|
| 2:50:23| I mean, we have lost a lot of staff because of this mask mandate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10223)|
| 2:50:27| I do have a question for you, Mr. DuPort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10227)|
| 2:50:32| So, you know, if this passes in light of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10232)|
| 2:50:38| I guess what are some of the potential responses the judge might come back with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10238)|
| 2:50:46| I mean, if we don't have the staff, could he make us—try to make us find staff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10246)|
| 2:50:51| I mean, is he going to send in federal marshals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10251)|
| 2:50:54| I mean, I assume that there is at his disposal, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10254)|
| 2:50:58| if he wanted to send in U.S. marshals to our schools to enforce, maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10258)|
| 2:51:03| Well, thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10263)|
| 2:51:06| I think it's premature to even look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10266)|
| 2:51:10| I mean, Ms. Bounds' motion goes to what the plaintiffs have requested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10270)|
| 2:51:15| and they requested that in the form of a motion to the judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10275)|
| 2:51:19| So the court hasn't made a ruling yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10279)|
| 2:51:22| so hard to say, you know, how the court would respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10282)|
| 2:51:27| I know that our office will certainly oppose the motion on behalf of the school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10287)|
| 2:51:33| but as I understand it, Ms. Bounds is simply saying that she doesn't want to agree with outside monitoring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10293)|
| 2:51:40| which I don't see any legal issue with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10300)|
| 2:51:44| Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10304)|
| 2:51:46| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10306)|
| 2:51:48| I just want to say I support Ms. Bounds' motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10308)|
| 2:51:51| I've talked to several schools recently that don't even have janitorial staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10311)|
| 2:51:56| They haven't had soap in bathrooms for weeks, but they want to send in mask police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10316)|
| 2:52:02| So let's talk about where our resources are really going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10322)|
| 2:52:05| So I 1,000 percent support Ms. Bounds' motion on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10325)|
| 2:52:12| So we have a motion by Ms. Bounds and a second by Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10332)|
| 2:52:19| So I guess we need to do another roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10339)|
| 2:52:24| Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10344)|
| 2:52:25| Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10345)|
| 2:52:27| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10347)|
| 2:52:28| Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10348)|
| 2:52:29| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10349)|
| 2:52:33| Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10353)|
| 2:52:35| Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10355)|
| 2:52:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10356)|
| 2:52:37| Yes, pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10357)|
| 2:52:38| Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10358)|
| 2:52:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10359)|
| 2:52:40| Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10360)|
| 2:52:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10361)|
| 2:52:42| Ms. Bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10362)|
| 2:52:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10363)|
| 2:52:44| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10364)|
| 2:52:45| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10365)|
| 2:52:46| Ms. Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10366)|
| 2:52:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10367)|
| 2:52:48| Ms. Satterfield, would you like to change your pass vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10368)|
| 2:52:51| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10371)|
| 2:52:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10372)|
| 2:52:53| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10373)|
| 2:52:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10374)|
| 2:52:55| Would you like to change your pass vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10375)|
| 2:52:57| What's the vote right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10377)|
| 2:52:59| It is five yes votes, one no vote, and three pass votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10379)|
| 2:53:03| I'll keep it as a pass, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10383)|
| 2:53:06| So motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10386)|
| 2:53:08| Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10388)|
| 2:53:14| Okay, I'm going to make my motion that I have changed a little bit, and I don't know where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10394)|
| 2:53:20| it will go, but I said, okay, I move that the Board of Education approve our Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10400)|
| 2:53:24| Law Department to engage into non-binding negotiating over the mass mandate litigation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10404)|
| 2:53:31| within the parameters of state law with the Board of Education represented by a member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10411)|
| 2:53:36| of the Board of Education Board Chair, Christy Christie, and a representative of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10416)|
| 2:53:41| Schools, with my suggestion being Jason Myers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10421)|
| 2:53:49| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10429)|
| 2:53:52| So we have a motion by Ms. Babb, and a second by Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10432)|
| 2:54:01| I don't know that I'm the best person to enter into this mediation after seeing the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10441)|
| 2:54:07| most latest demands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10447)|
| 2:54:13| You know, I mean, I know that it would have to pass, and whatever Mr. Oaks and I came| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10453)|
| 2:54:22| up with, it would still come back to the Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10462)|
| 2:54:24| It's actually Mr. Myers now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10464)|
| 2:54:25| Oh, Mr. Myers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10465)|
| 2:54:28| Mr. Myers got my lucky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10468)|
| 2:54:33| It would still have to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10473)|
| 2:54:37| Just to be clear, it would not be me and Mr. Myers negotiating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10477)|
| 2:54:43| I mean, anything that we did would have to come back to the Board for a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10483)|
| 2:54:47| And that is non-binding, and I mean, that's the whole thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10487)|
| 2:54:49| As a Board, we can't come up with a negotiating tactic, but also they can't negotiate something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10489)|
| 2:54:55| and guaranteeing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10495)|
| 2:54:56| It is non-binding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10496)|
| 2:54:57| You know, I do think highly of both of those people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10497)|
| 2:55:01| I think they bring some expertise that I don't know if even this Board would pass it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10501)|
| 2:55:08| I don't know if it would go anywhere, but I'm just trying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10508)|
| 2:55:12| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10512)|
| 2:55:13| I mean, I don't know that there's anything to lose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10513)|
| 2:55:15| Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10515)|
| 2:55:16| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10516)|
| 2:55:17| I'm completely comfortable with Ms. Christie and Mr. Myers representing us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10517)|
| 2:55:23| We talked earlier about waiting for the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10523)|
| 2:55:27| Are you suggesting this for now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10527)|
| 2:55:30| Yes, I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10530)|
| 2:55:33| On the mediation, I was going to say to wait, but I think I've changed its negotiation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10533)|
| 2:55:38| and I would like to say go ahead and start because I think even sometimes, even if we say we're going to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10538)|
| 2:55:45| I've seen nothing happens quickly in the legal realm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10545)|
| 2:55:50| I am proposing to go ahead and ask the law department to start negotiations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10550)|
| 2:55:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10557)|
| 2:55:58| Mr. Dugler, would you like to weigh in on this at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10558)|
| 2:56:01| Do you have anything to add to the conversation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10561)|
| 2:56:04| I mean, because I guess the question would be, I feel like, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10564)|
| 2:56:09| the law department has had conversation with them, so would this be a difference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10569)|
| 2:56:16| Would there be a difference, I guess?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10576)|
| 2:56:20| Thank you, Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10580)|
| 2:56:21| Yeah, yes, there would be, I mean, a difference because, I mean, we can continue to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10581)|
| 2:56:27| a negotiation would be a continued conversation, whether it be, you know, telephone, email, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10587)|
| 2:56:37| but if the board has some representatives that the board would like for us to, you know, confer with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10597)|
| 2:56:47| then, I mean, that would be a change in that aspect of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10607)|
| 2:56:51| and then, but as you all have readily recognized, no matter what happens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10611)|
| 2:56:57| I mean, if we came to some type of a proposed resolution, it would have to come back before the full board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10617)|
| 2:57:05| It would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10625)|
| 2:57:06| It would have to come back before the full board for approval of any type of settlement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10626)|
| 2:57:13| Yeah, and that would be the reason I would be comfortable doing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10633)|
| 2:57:18| is I would not, you know, want it to just be on me and Jason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10638)|
| 2:57:24| So we have a motion by Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10644)|
| 2:57:28| Did we get a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10648)|
| 2:57:32| And a second by Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10652)|
| 2:57:35| Is there any more discussion on this motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10655)|
| 2:57:39| Ms. Putney, do you want to do a roll call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10659)|
| 2:57:43| Ms. Satterfield?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10663)|
| 2:57:45| Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10665)|
| 2:57:47| Ms. Owen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10667)|
| 2:57:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10668)|
| 2:57:49| Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10669)|
| 2:57:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10671)|
| 2:57:52| Ms. Babb?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10672)|
| 2:57:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10674)|
| 2:57:55| Ms. Horn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10675)|
| 2:57:57| Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10677)|
| 2:57:58| Ms. Henderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10678)|
| 2:58:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10680)|
| 2:58:01| Ms. Bounds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10681)|
| 2:58:02| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10682)|
| 2:58:03| Mr. McMillan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10683)|
| 2:58:04| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10684)|
| 2:58:05| Ms. Christy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10685)|
| 2:58:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10686)|
| 2:58:08| That's five yes votes and two no votes and two pass votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10688)|
| 2:58:11| Ms. Satterfield, would you like to change your pass?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10691)|
| 2:58:14| Ms. Horn, would you like to change your pass?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10694)|
| 2:58:16| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10696)|
| 2:58:18| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10698)|
| 2:58:20| Ms. Horn, did you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10700)|
| 2:58:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10703)|
| 2:58:25| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10705)|
| 2:58:31| Before I make this motion, if I could have a little bit of feedback first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10711)|
| 2:58:37| One of the motions that I discussed is directing the law department to file a change of circumstance based on current conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10717)|
| 2:58:47| So what I would be interested in hearing from the board on before I make the motion is if anybody has this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10727)|
| 2:58:55| and we don't have to come to a decision, but just throwing it out there before I make the motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10735)|
| 2:58:59| would anybody have an opinion on whether we direct that now or put a date on it for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10739)|
| 2:59:11| I guess that's the question, is would the board be in favor of that as of now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10751)|
| 2:59:17| Putting a date on the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10757)|
| 2:59:18| On the change of motion, to file the change of motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10758)|
| 2:59:20| or would board members be more in favor of just directing that for now to do as soon as possible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10760)|
| 2:59:28| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10768)|
| 2:59:29| I mean, in my motion, I had put the date on it because I wanted, I didn't want it to get lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10769)|
| 2:59:38| I mean, I'm not locked into that date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10778)|
| 2:59:41| I just felt like we needed to put a hard date on it to make sure that it got, I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10781)|
| 2:59:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10787)|
| 2:59:48| So we would have a very clear expectation of when that was going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10788)|
| 2:59:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10791)|
| 2:59:52| Thank you for that feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10792)|
| 2:59:55| I don't have an opinion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10795)|
| 2:59:56| I just want to ask Mr. Dupler, can you explain a little bit on change of circumstances?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10796)|
| 3:00:00| If we ask for this, is it being directed to Judge Greer, and is it something that goes before him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10800)|
| 3:00:06| I mean, I just don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10806)|
| 3:00:08| It's to the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10808)|
| 3:00:09| Yeah, I mean, that's my understanding, Mr. Dupler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10809)|
| 3:00:13| And does he consider things like that at any time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10813)|
| 3:00:15| I just don't know enough about how this works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10815)|
| 3:00:17| Yes, I mean, thank you, Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10817)|
| 3:00:21| We have discussed that briefly in other sessions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10821)|
| 3:00:25| And, yes, I mean, so a motion for a change of circumstance would go directly to Judge Greer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10825)|
| 3:00:32| The plaintiffs would then have a chance to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10832)|
| 3:00:35| And I think to Ms. Horne's point, the other, I think the thing that she's looking at as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10835)|
| 3:00:43| and she can correct me if I'm wrong, is that, you know, as the Omicron cases go down, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10843)|
| 3:00:50| I mean, at this point it may be, you know, somewhat speculative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10850)|
| 3:00:54| although if you look at other models, probably not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10854)|
| 3:00:57| But then, you know, if you give it just a little bit more time, perhaps that model is even better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10857)|
| 3:01:03| But, again, she can correct me if I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10863)|
| 3:01:05| No, that's kind of what my question was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10865)|
| 3:01:08| I mean, we could do it now, but if we give it another week, that could be even,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10868)|
| 3:01:14| there could be further proof that we're moving in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10874)|
| 3:01:17| I'd almost give to next Friday because in the Health Department coming out with reports every Thursday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10877)|
| 3:01:23| Mr. Myers might know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10883)|
| 3:01:25| It's Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10885)|
| 3:01:26| Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10886)|
| 3:01:27| When is Health Department coming out with reports?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10887)|
| 3:01:29| Is it every Wednesday now or every Thursday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10889)|
| 3:01:32| On COVID cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10892)|
| 3:01:33| I think it's every Wednesday, but I haven't double-checked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10893)|
| 3:01:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10895)|
| 3:01:37| Ms. Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10897)|
| 3:01:40| I'm sorry, do you want me to go to Ms. Owen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10900)|
| 3:01:42| But I'll support it either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10902)|
| 3:01:43| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10903)|
| 3:01:45| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10905)|
| 3:01:47| I was going to also suggest lower numbers, and the state is supposed to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10907)|
| 3:01:53| supposed to is not the right word, the state has said that they publish numbers on Wednesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10913)|
| 3:01:58| but those numbers have not been updated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10918)|
| 3:02:00| The most recent numbers that are actually there are the fifth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10920)|
| 3:02:04| So that's all I have to look at right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10924)|
| 3:02:08| As of February 5th, it looks like the seven-day average was around 1,020 per day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10928)|
| 3:02:18| January 29th, it was higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10938)|
| 3:02:20| It was 1,204.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10940)|
| 3:02:25| If we go all the way back to December 27th, where's that, 29th, it would have been 143.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10945)|
| 3:02:35| So if we use Ms. Henderson's previous pre-Omicron, we would be looking at something below 102.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10955)|
| 3:02:45| However, this court order was put in place long pre-Omicron.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10965)|
| 3:02:53| So I would suggest using numbers from August and say that if they fell below those August numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10973)|
| 3:03:05| and at that point we were looking at closer to somewhere around 130, 140 for a seven-day average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=10985)|
| 3:03:20| It's currently 1,020, but that's last week's number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11000)|
| 3:03:25| In the weeks before that, let's see, January 29th, it was 1,200.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11005)|
| 3:03:30| So, yes, it is falling, and we don't know what this week's number is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11010)|
| 3:03:36| Well, I know the number for Knox County, I believe, is down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11016)|
| 3:03:42| It's right at 9,900, and last week around this time it was around 13,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11022)|
| 3:03:48| somewhere between 13,000 and 14,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11028)|
| 3:03:51| So it's dropped pretty dramatically in a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11031)|
| 3:03:56| I'm trying to pull up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11036)|
| 3:03:58| Did I say sitting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11038)|
| 3:04:00| Yeah, I'm looking at Knox County cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11040)|
| 3:04:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11042)|
| 3:04:05| I'm looking at all of them right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11045)|
| 3:04:15| I thought a new number came out today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11055)|
| 3:04:17| It's supposed to be Wednesday, but they're not published yet, state or local.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11057)|
| 3:04:26| Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11066)|
| 3:04:28| I just wanted to add some clarification for that a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11068)|
| 3:04:30| So on September 1st, for children, it was 250 children with COVID, 16 kids on a Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11070)|
| 3:04:40| I would say that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11080)|
| 3:04:43| Cases are collapsing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11083)|
| 3:04:45| Based on...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11085)|
| 3:04:48| I think what Ms. Horn is asking is for a change of circumstance that the judge might actually consider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11088)|
| 3:04:57| and I believe, and correct me if I'm wrong, Mr. Dupler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11097)|
| 3:05:00| I believe part of his original consideration was community spread.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11100)|
| 3:05:06| So I think we might have to, for him to consider it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11106)|
| 3:05:10| I think we would need to look at community spread as well for a change of circumstance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11110)|
| 3:05:18| I'd have to look back at it, but I would encourage this board to look at both circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11118)|
| 3:05:28| I mean, obviously, if we want the best motion possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11128)|
| 3:05:31| So maybe we could say and, so that he could look at both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11131)|
| 3:05:36| So if they dropped below those beginning of school numbers for children and for community spread.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11136)|
| 3:05:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11147)|
| 3:05:48| Well, and if I may, I think part of the change of circumstance that I have in mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11148)|
| 3:05:52| is also the mounting evidence that we have from all of the medical entities around the country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11152)|
| 3:05:58| and actually around the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11158)|
| 3:06:01| So I think that's kind of also part of my thinking is it's not just the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11161)|
| 3:06:06| I mean, I think we do have evidence that it's dropping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11166)|
| 3:06:10| the case counts are dropping among children specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11170)|
| 3:06:14| However, I think that the change of circumstance that I think, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11174)|
| 3:06:19| also that needs to be considered is the change in science.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11179)|
| 3:06:22| I mean, everybody always talks about science evolves and science changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11182)|
| 3:06:27| We have studies from around the world with science.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11187)|
| 3:06:33| And so that's a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11193)|
| 3:06:35| I understand that's a lot to go through because there are tons of reports and studies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11195)|
| 3:06:40| And they are from, as we talked about earlier, they're from reputable doctors and hospitals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11200)|
| 3:06:48| So I think that's part of it, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11208)|
| 3:06:51| I think we may have 250 kids in our school system that have COVID or some sort of coronavirus forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11211)|
| 3:07:00| So that's not what I'm talking about necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11220)|
| 3:07:03| Sure, we can look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11223)|
| 3:07:05| But, I mean, the numbers that for kids in Knox County, it's dropping like a rock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11225)|
| 3:07:11| And I'm not, once again, everybody can get a vaccine if they want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11231)|
| 3:07:16| I don't really, that's not my, I don't care about them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11236)|
| 3:07:18| I'm talking about kids wearing masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11238)|
| 3:07:20| So we need to look at the fact that every time you turn on a news report or your computer to look at your email,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11240)|
| 3:07:30| there's a new study that states something new about what they know about masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11250)|
| 3:07:35| The CDC has even said that cloth masks do not work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11255)|
| 3:07:40| So let's, was the CDC referenced in this case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11260)|
| 3:07:45| I believe it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11265)|
| 3:07:47| I believe it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11267)|
| 3:07:48| Thank you, Ms. Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11268)|
| 3:07:49| So, you know, I think, again, I mean, if this board's directing us to file a motion, we'll be happy to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11269)|
| 3:07:58| But we'll want to use any evidence that's available to prove our point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11278)|
| 3:08:04| I will point out that you have to be careful with the CDC because the CDC, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11284)|
| 3:08:11| has talked about N95s versus cloth masks, and they have made that distinction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11291)|
| 3:08:16| But the last I checked, which was yesterday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11296)|
| 3:08:19| they're still unfortunately saying that school children should be universally masked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11299)|
| 3:08:25| Well, I've never been a fan of going by the CDC guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11305)|
| 3:08:28| That's been on record multiple times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11308)|
| 3:08:30| So that's a great point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11310)|
| 3:08:34| I definitely don't hang my hat on what they say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11314)|
| 3:08:38| But there are many other studies that I've sent to the law department that can be referenced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11318)|
| 3:08:43| So I do think the case counts are dropping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11323)|
| 3:08:46| I think another week down the road they're going to drop even further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11326)|
| 3:08:49| So if the board is agreeable, then when I make this motion, I can make the motion that it be filed by the 18th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11329)|
| 3:08:58| Is that next Friday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11338)|
| 3:09:00| Friday, February 18th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11340)|
| 3:09:03| So if everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11343)|
| 3:09:07| Ms. Henderson, did you have something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11347)|
| 3:09:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11350)|
| 3:09:11| I'd also like to go on record in the change of circumstance if we could include medical experts in that also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11351)|
| 3:09:18| because like Ms. Horn was saying, the science is changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11358)|
| 3:09:21| And, you know, I'd also like to say, you know, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11361)|
| 3:09:25| the numbers on Friday for sick children were 16 out of 60,000 children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11365)|
| 3:09:31| This is about kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11371)|
| 3:09:32| This isn't about the adults that are sick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11372)|
| 3:09:34| It's not about cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11374)|
| 3:09:35| It's about hospitalization and death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11375)|
| 3:09:37| That's the whole point of the vaccine was to get the hospitalizations down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11377)|
| 3:09:41| not to get the cases to zero and keep our kids in masks every time we're fearful of another variant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11381)|
| 3:09:53| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11393)|
| 3:09:56| What I'm saying is that if you're taking the temperature of the room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11396)|
| 3:10:01| I would not support anything that didn't look at community spread as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11401)|
| 3:10:08| And that's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11408)|
| 3:10:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11411)|
| 3:10:12| Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11412)|
| 3:10:13| I can support next Friday because I think that if we follow the trends of the rest of the world,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11413)|
| 3:10:18| I think we are going to see big changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11418)|
| 3:10:20| But I think the number one circumstance change is the fact that our school children are eligible for a vaccination,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11420)|
| 3:10:27| which they were not eligible for when this original injunction went in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11427)|
| 3:10:32| And I think, to me, that really is a game changer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11432)|
| 3:10:36| And that was what I kind of kept waiting for back when we were in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11436)|
| 3:10:39| And so, I mean, I think you've got the fact that anyone who wants to, it's not required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11439)|
| 3:10:43| We're not requiring it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11443)|
| 3:10:44| But anybody that wants to get their child a vaccination, they are eligible to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11444)|
| 3:10:49| And then, as you said, we are seeing so many around the country changing their stances on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11449)|
| 3:10:54| So, I have, I can support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11454)|
| 3:10:59| Ms. Nix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11459)|
| 3:11:01| Ms. Bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11461)|
| 3:11:02| It doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11462)|
| 3:11:04| Yeah, I hear what Ms. Owens is saying, and that was a part of Judge Greer's order, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11464)|
| 3:11:10| But I don't know how you can really consider community spread when Knox County is totally unmasked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11470)|
| 3:11:19| I mean, his order should have masked the whole county up, you know, not just the school children who are bearing the brunt of all of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11479)|
| 3:11:27| So, while they are masked at school, they are not masked, you know, any evening or the weekends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11487)|
| 3:11:35| So, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11495)|
| 3:11:37| It makes no sense to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11497)|
| 3:11:40| Ms. Sanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11500)|
| 3:11:43| I agree with Ms. Bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11503)|
| 3:11:45| You know, we can't talk about community spread when no one is wearing a mask in our county, and our children are the only ones forced to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11505)|
| 3:11:52| And I agree with Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11512)|
| 3:11:54| While I am against mandated vaccines, all of our children have the ability to get a vaccine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11514)|
| 3:12:02| And to me, that was always the end game of people who wanted to wear masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11522)|
| 3:12:07| The end game, I was told, was as soon as children are eligible to get vaccinated, we'll be fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11527)|
| 3:12:14| And the goalpost keeps moving, and enough is enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11534)|
| 3:12:17| So, I would like to make a motion to direct the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11537)|
| 3:12:25| Ms. Horne, may I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11545)|
| 3:12:27| Yes, certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11547)|
| 3:12:28| So, I would point one other thing out, you know, as far as timing goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11548)|
| 3:12:34| If this board wants competent medical testimony to go along with the motion in addition to figures and, you know, reference material,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11554)|
| 3:12:47| then we will need a little bit more time because you can't just have a doctor send a letter or a medical report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11567)|
| 3:12:57| You have to be able to secure actual testimony from that doctor that's very specific to the task at hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11577)|
| 3:13:04| So, if this board does want the medical testimony with the motion, I would suggest, you know, I hate to say 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11584)|
| 3:13:14| but I would suggest at least two or three weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11594)|
| 3:13:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11600)|
| 3:13:22| So, today is February 9th, tomorrow is the 10th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11602)|
| 3:13:27| If we say Friday, how about if we say, how about Monday, February 28th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11607)|
| 3:13:36| That's a little over two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11616)|
| 3:13:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11620)|
| 3:13:44| So, the motion is to direct the law department to file a change of circumstance that reflects the fact that vaccines are available to everyone in our school buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11624)|
| 3:13:55| that Omicron is less severe than other variants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11635)|
| 3:14:02| There's proof of that in studies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11642)|
| 3:14:04| I'm sorry, I shouldn't say that during the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11644)|
| 3:14:06| So, that's not part of the motion, Terry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11646)|
| 3:14:10| That mask mandates are being lifted all over the country, that one-way masking protects the wearer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11650)|
| 3:14:20| and any other additional medical studies that can be cited to assist in the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11660)|
| 3:14:31| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11671)|
| 3:14:32| And that that be provided to the court no later than February 28th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11672)|
| 3:14:38| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11678)|
| 3:14:40| We have a motion by Ms. Horne and a second by Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11680)|
| 3:14:44| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11684)|
| 3:14:47| I can support that if the one-way masking section is out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11687)|
| 3:14:54| If there's –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11694)|
| 3:14:55| If the one-way masking portion of that is not in the motion, I can support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11695)|
| 3:15:03| Hold on one second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11703)|
| 3:15:20| Can we have Ms. Coatney read that back to you while you're looking because I –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11720)|
| 3:15:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11726)|
| 3:15:27| I will try my best, Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11727)|
| 3:15:30| To direct the law department to file a change of circumstance that references vaccines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11730)|
| 3:15:35| that vaccines are available to everyone in our buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11735)|
| 3:15:38| that mask mandates are being lifted all over the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11738)|
| 3:15:42| and that mask protects the wearer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11742)|
| 3:15:45| and any other information that could assist in the case by February the 28th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11745)|
| 3:15:52| So, Ms. Owen, there's –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11752)|
| 3:15:54| From what Ms. Henderson has given us, there's documentation from a doctor at Harvard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11754)|
| 3:16:00| and also doctors from Tufts, Boston Medical, Harvard Medical School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11760)|
| 3:16:10| I mean, it's multiple doctors in multiple places, so it's not just one person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11770)|
| 3:16:17| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11777)|
| 3:16:20| There's also massive evidence to show that masking the community prevents community spread.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11780)|
| 3:16:31| So –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11791)|
| 3:16:32| Pardon me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11792)|
| 3:16:33| This is our meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11793)|
| 3:16:35| So what I'm saying is that the one-way masking, if that is in the motion, I cannot support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11795)|
| 3:16:43| If it is not in the motion, I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11803)|
| 3:16:45| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11805)|
| 3:16:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11806)|
| 3:16:49| So we have a –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11809)|
| 3:16:50| Terri, would you mind reading the motion one more time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11810)|
| 3:16:52| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11812)|
| 3:16:54| The motion is to direct the law department to file a change of circumstance that references| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11814)|
| 3:17:00| that vaccines are available to everyone in our buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11820)|
| 3:17:04| that mask mandates have been lifted all over the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11824)|
| 3:17:08| and that masks protect the wearer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11828)|
| 3:17:12| and any other information that could assist in the case by February the 28th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11832)|
| 3:17:19| So that motion by Ms. Horne and a second by Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11839)|
| 3:17:24| Mr. McMillan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11844)|
| 3:17:25| Who's he supposed to file it with, the judge or Judge Greer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11845)|
| 3:17:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11852)|
| 3:17:35| The only other thing I would add, I mean, again, is that we will follow the board's motion should it pass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11855)|
| 3:17:45| but we will have to search and actually use competent evidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11865)|
| 3:17:49| We can't use such things as newspaper articles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11869)|
| 3:17:53| Just so the board understands that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11873)|
| 3:17:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11876)|
| 3:17:57| So, Ms. Coatney, do we want to do a roll call vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11877)|
| 3:18:01| Ms. Satterfield?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11881)|

| 3:18:22| Ms. Christy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11902)|
| 3:18:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11903)|
| 3:18:24| That is five yes votes, one no vote, and two pass votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11904)|
| 3:18:27| Ms. Satterfield, would you like to change your pass votes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11907)|
| 3:18:30| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11910)|

| 3:18:35| So motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11915)|
| 3:18:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11917)|
| 3:18:54| We have two more people for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11934)|
| 3:18:56| Caitlin Jones?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11936)|
| 3:18:57| Hold on just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11937)|
| 3:18:58| I'm sorry, Ms. Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11938)|
| 3:18:59| Sorry, we have another motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11939)|
| 3:19:01| Ms. Horne has another motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11941)|
| 3:19:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11944)|
| 3:19:10| I would like to make a motion to ask Law Director Boog to appoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11950)|
| 3:19:14| Houston Havasy to assist in this case along with Amanda Morris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11954)|
| 3:19:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11961)|
| 3:19:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11964)|

| 3:19:28| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11968)|
| 3:19:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11972)|
| 3:19:33| Ms. Coatney, do we want to do a roll call vote on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11973)|
| 3:19:35| Can you restate the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11975)|
| 3:19:37| Will you restate it, Ms. Horne?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11977)|
| 3:19:39| Do you want to restate it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11979)|
| 3:19:40| Ms. Coatney, can you restate it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11980)|
| 3:19:42| The motion was to ask Law Director David Boog to appoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11982)|
| 3:19:45| Houston Havasy to assist Amanda Morris in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11985)|
| 3:19:50| Can I make a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11990)|
| 3:19:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11991)|
| 3:19:54| Just quick, I won't sport this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11994)|
| 3:19:58| not that I have any problem with him selecting somebody of his choosing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=11998)|
| 3:20:06| but he knows his department much better than we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=12006)|
| 3:20:10| and people that he can use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=12010)|
| 3:20:16| Anyway, I just want to explain that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=12016)|
| 3:20:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=12019)|
| 3:20:21| Mr. Duport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=12021)|
| 3:20:22| Thank you, Madam Chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=12022)|
| 3:20:23| and I guess I need to piggyback off what Mr. McMillan is saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=12023)|
| 3:20:28| I mean, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=12028)|
| 3:20:30| there are reasons why certain attorneys are assigned to certain cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=12030)|
| 3:20:34| I obviously have a pretty full workload as is seen tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=12034)|
| 3:20:38| you know, managing this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=12038)|
| 3:20:40| But, you know, well, you all are great folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=12040)|
| 3:20:48| I enjoy working with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=12048)|
| 3:20:50| But I might suggest that maybe you make a motion that the Law Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=12050)|
| 3:21:00| David Boog, come up with, you know, another attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=12060)|
| 3:21:05| I mean, you know, because Houston Havasy may or may not be available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=12065)|
| 3:21:08| I just don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=12068)|
| 3:21:09| But, I mean, I'm just throwing that out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=12069)|
| 3:21:11| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=12071)|
| 3:21:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=12075)|
| 3:21:16| I'll make an amended motion that based on the comments that we ask the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=12076)|
| 3:21:23| Director to appoint, and I can't remember how you said it, Gary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=12083)|
| 3:21:31| but an available someone else to assist Amanda Morris in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=12091)|
| 3:21:39| Would you like to add Houston Havasy if he is available for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=12099)|
| 3:21:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=12103)|
| 3:21:44| With it being Houston Havasy if he is available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=12104)|
| 3:21:46| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=12106)|
| 3:21:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=12107)|
| 3:21:51| So, are you okay with that, Ms. Shatterfield?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=12111)|
| 3:21:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=12113)|
| 3:21:54| So, Ms. Putney, will you restate that and do a roll call vote for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=12114)|
| 3:21:59| The motion is to ask Law Director David Boog to appoint another available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=12119)|
| 3:22:03| attorney to assist Amanda Morris in this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220209?start=12123)|
