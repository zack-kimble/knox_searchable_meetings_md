| 0:06:04| Yes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=364)|
| 0:06:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=365)|
| 0:06:06| That's a motion to suspend the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=366)|
| 0:06:07| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=367)|
| 0:06:08| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=368)|
| 0:06:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=369)|
| 0:06:10| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=370)|
| 0:06:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=371)|
| 0:06:12| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=372)|
| 0:06:13| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=373)|
| 0:06:14| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=374)|
| 0:06:15| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=375)|
| 0:06:16| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=376)|
| 0:06:17| And we will move those up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=377)|
| 0:06:18| Is your light still on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=378)|
| 0:06:19| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=379)|
| 0:06:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=380)|
| 0:06:21| I'm losing my microphone here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=381)|
| 0:06:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=382)|
| 0:06:23| The mayor's report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=383)|
| 0:06:24| I want to just announce to council, some of you may have seen it in the press yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=384)|
| 0:06:43| I and my leadership team went to the 911 center, the emergency operations center, and we were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=403)|
| 0:06:51| prepped, really given an emergency response orientation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=411)|
| 0:06:55| I want to thank our fire chief, Stan Sharp, and several members of his team, and Chief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=415)|
| 0:07:01| Roush, and the 911 center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=421)|
| 0:07:04| We had representatives from Homeland Security, from TEMA, from the health department, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=424)|
| 0:07:12| several others who are involved in our emergency response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=432)|
| 0:07:18| And we have a plan in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=438)|
| 0:07:21| It is a good plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=441)|
| 0:07:24| And we have a very talented team and a lot of great partnerships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=444)|
| 0:07:29| And I wanted to make sure that those in my administration were aware of what the plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=449)|
| 0:07:34| are in case of an emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=454)|
| 0:07:36| Of course, as we said that day, we hope that an emergency of great magnitude never happens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=456)|
| 0:07:43| but I'm confident that we are prepared should it happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=463)|
| 0:07:47| So again, thank you, Chief Sharp, for setting up that four-hour orientation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=467)|
| 0:07:53| FEMA actually has a suggested training program that executives and senior staff go through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=473)|
| 0:08:00| and that was part of that four-hour training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=480)|
| 0:08:03| So we are trained, so we won't get in the way if something happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=483)|
| 0:08:08| So the second thing I wanted to announce is that tomorrow I will be traveling to Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=488)|
| 0:08:15| and we'll be meeting up with the mayors of Memphis, Nashville, and Chattanooga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=495)|
| 0:08:21| So the big four cities, those mayors will be meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=501)|
| 0:08:27| We were meeting with Governor Haslam, and we're meeting with House Speaker Beth Harwell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=507)|
| 0:08:33| and with Lieutenant Governor Ron Ramsey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=513)|
| 0:08:36| And our goal is to express some of our concerns about some of the legislation, frankly, that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=516)|
| 0:08:43| in Nashville right now that is aiming to take away a lot of local government control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=523)|
| 0:08:49| on the things that we have responsibility for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=529)|
| 0:08:52| So we will be, you know, meeting with these elected officials to express our concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=532)|
| 0:08:58| about that and other issues that we are supporting in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=538)|
| 0:09:03| So I will be sure to send the governor your hellos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=543)|
| 0:09:08| I know you would want me to do that, and I'm sure he's going to want to know how you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=548)|
| 0:09:11| are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=551)|
| 0:09:12| But that's where I'll be tomorrow, and if you need me, you can still catch me on my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=552)|
| 0:09:17| cell phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=557)|
| 0:09:18| So now we'll have reports of council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=558)|
| 0:09:21| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=561)|
| 0:09:22| Yes, Madam Mayor, if I may, I would like to recognize Denise Moretz and Bob Cross, who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=562)|
| 0:09:28| co-chaired the Pension Task Force at this time, to come down and perhaps if they wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=568)|
| 0:09:34| to make some statements about where we are, where their work is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=574)|
| 0:09:40| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=580)|
| 0:09:42| Please come on down to the podium and please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=582)|
| 0:09:50| Denise Moretz, 6445 Cobble Creek Way, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=590)|
| 0:09:56| Bob Cross, 900 South Gay Street, Suite 1796, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=596)|
| 0:10:03| We just wanted to report to council that we have completed our work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=603)|
| 0:10:09| The task force had its last meeting last Thursday evening and prepared a report, which the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=609)|
| 0:10:17| recorder's office has a copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=617)|
| 0:10:18| I'm not sure it's been distributed to everybody, all the council members, but our report is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=618)|
| 0:10:24| complete and has been submitted, and I think that's all that we have time for tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=624)|
| 0:10:34| And that report is also on the city website with all the attachments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=634)|
| 0:10:43| Are there any questions of council about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=643)|
| 0:10:46| I see Councilman Della Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=646)|
| 0:10:48| Yes, I wondered, we're past the procedural point, but I noticed that one of the items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=648)|
| 0:10:53| that was added to the agenda was an item, a resolution thanking this body of task force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=653)|
| 0:11:00| members for their work, and it might be an appropriate thing to do to bring that up now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=660)|
| 0:11:05| because these people gave up lots of nights and hours piling through papers and listening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=665)|
| 0:11:11| to technical information until probably their eyes crossed at night, and they struggled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=671)|
| 0:11:16| because there are diverse views on their task force, any of you who have attended them or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=676)|
| 0:11:20| watched them, and they tried very hard to come down with a report and to provide a service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=680)|
| 0:11:26| to the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=686)|
| 0:11:27| I know we're all grateful, and maybe we should take up Mr. Pavlis's motion at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=687)|
| 0:11:32| Yes, I was going to ask to suspend the rules to where we could hear that, but first I'd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=692)|
| 0:11:38| like to, I know there's probably other members of the task force here that if I could get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=698)|
| 0:11:43| them to stand to recognize them as well for all the hard work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=703)|
| 0:11:48| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=708)|
| 0:11:53| If I could, I would move to suspend the rules to move resolution 11-L up to be heard now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=713)|
| 0:12:05| if I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=725)|
| 0:12:06| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=726)|
| 0:12:07| We have a motion and a second to suspend the rules to hear 11-L. All in favor of suspending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=727)|
| 0:12:13| the rules and hearing that now, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=733)|
| 0:12:16| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=736)|
| 0:12:17| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=737)|
| 0:12:18| Okay, so now, you want to read that into the minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=738)|
| 0:12:25| 11-L is a resolution expressing appreciation to the members of the pension task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=745)|
| 0:12:32| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=752)|
| 0:12:34| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=754)|
| 0:12:35| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=755)|
| 0:12:36| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=756)|
| 0:12:37| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=757)|
| 0:12:39| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=759)|
| 0:12:40| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=760)|
| 0:12:41| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=761)|
| 0:12:43| I would also like to thank you for the work that you did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=763)|
| 0:12:47| We are, you know, have seen your report, and I want to assure council that we are taking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=767)|
| 0:12:53| a look at this, and we will be coming, we will be responding to it very shortly with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=773)|
| 0:12:59| our plan of attack, our plan of action in order to take what they have found in their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=779)|
| 0:13:06| recommendations and turn that into some proposals for you all to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=786)|
| 0:13:13| Any questions about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=793)|
| 0:13:17| Thanks again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=797)|
| 0:13:18| Okay, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=798)|
| 0:13:25| Okay, right, we'll go back to reports of council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=805)|
| 0:13:29| Is that council member Campbell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=809)|
| 0:13:31| Thank you, Madam Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=811)|
| 0:13:33| I wanted to re-invite council, or you may be aware or remember I was appointed to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=813)|
| 0:13:39| Food Policy Task Force, and I believe Stephanie Welch is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=819)|
| 0:13:44| She may or may not want to say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=824)|
| 0:13:45| We had a meeting today, and on March 9th, there's an event that you may want to attend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=825)|

| 0:14:27| bring attention to the fact that Knoxville is a healthy community, and we do support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=867)|

| 0:15:19| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=919)|
| 0:15:20| I guess I wanted to thank you and to notify people in the Fourth District that you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=920)|
| 0:15:25| graciously agreed to meet with the business owners and residents in that area to talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=925)|
| 0:15:30| about things like vagrancy and prostitution and the questions that have been raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=930)|
| 0:15:35| And that's March, no, excuse me, February the 27th at the Broadway Dance Studio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=935)|
| 0:15:41| I want to say it's 6 p.m., but I'm not 100 percent sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=941)|

| 0:15:45| 6 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=945)|
| 0:15:46| And so, obviously, anyone out there who is interested from the Fourth District, please| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=946)|
| 0:15:51| try to attend that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=951)|
| 0:15:52| It's a chance to meet with the mayor, the administration, and talk about issues we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=952)|
| 0:15:56| talked about with the police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=956)|
| 0:15:58| But certainly, a team working together is going to be more effective, and we really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=958)|
| 0:16:02| appreciate you coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=962)|

| 0:26:23| Councilman Dallavapi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1583)|
| 0:26:24| Yes, Madam Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1584)|
| 0:26:26| There was a public meeting last night hosted by KCDC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1586)|
| 0:26:31| and I guess it's one of probably several that will be coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1591)|
| 0:26:35| But this is a very interesting project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1595)|
| 0:26:37| It has questions that they are working hard to answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1597)|
| 0:26:41| and one of them is traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1601)|
| 0:26:42| and how do you put 6,600 cars a day onto both Kingston Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1602)|
| 0:26:48| and Joe Johnson as it turns into Neyland Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1608)|
| 0:26:52| And I know they have had experts look at that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1612)|
| 0:26:55| and there is some concern about that, but I know they're looking at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1615)|
| 0:26:58| So I just want to commend them for doing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1618)|
| 0:27:00| and for going through the public hearing process with KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1620)|
| 0:27:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1626)|
| 0:27:09| Steve, would you like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1629)|
| 0:27:11| Only I'd like to recognize Bud Cullum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1631)|
| 0:27:13| Only if he wishes to comment on the meeting last night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1633)|
| 0:27:17| You don't have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1637)|
| 0:27:20| Thank you, Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1640)|
| 0:27:22| Bud Cullum, 6312 Kingston Pike, Knoxville, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1642)|
| 0:27:27| We did have a, I thought, very productive meeting at KCDC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1647)|
| 0:27:32| and as Councilman Dallavapi said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1652)|
| 0:27:35| there will be many more meetings regarding this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1655)|
| 0:27:38| before it comes hopefully to fruition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1658)|
| 0:27:41| But I would like to address the traffic issue once more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1661)|
| 0:27:46| before this Council at this stage since it has just come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1666)|
| 0:27:50| We have had Wilbur Smith, which now after a merger is CDM Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1670)|
| 0:27:55| which has done traffic engineering work directly for the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1675)|
| 0:27:59| and for county and state, a long history of big projects in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1679)|
| 0:28:05| They did not only an exhaustive traffic impact analysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1685)|
| 0:28:10| but they did a traffic, as I call it, a traffic study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1690)|
| 0:28:14| that took into account using figures based on an estimated 2015,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1694)|
| 0:28:21| which also took into account the effects of the city's planned road diet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1701)|
| 0:28:27| for Cumberland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1707)|
| 0:28:29| And it identified not only issues, traffic issues that exist currently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1709)|
| 0:28:36| but it then took into account the estimated number of new trips| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1716)|
| 0:28:41| that our project would incur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1721)|
| 0:28:45| And the long and short of that is with some suggestions that they have made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1725)|
| 0:28:51| to not only what was the obvious is completely redoing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1731)|
| 0:28:56| I started to say the intersection, kind of more a series of intersections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1736)|
| 0:29:00| at Kingston Pike right before you go under the CSX overpass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1740)|
| 0:29:05| but it also took into account clear back to Nalin Drive at Joe Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1745)|
| 0:29:12| And we not only have come up with a plan to make this work for our project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1752)|
| 0:29:19| but actually the level of service at Nalin and Joe Johnson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1759)|
| 0:29:25| is going to be higher than currently exists today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1765)|
| 0:29:28| Bless you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1768)|
| 0:29:30| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1770)|
| 0:29:31| I'm fighting the same problem if I sound funny tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1771)|
| 0:29:34| So we're excited from the standpoint that we not only can provide a project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1774)|
| 0:29:42| that we think turns a blighted brownfield into a very productive, needed retail facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1782)|
| 0:29:49| but the number of jobs and the ancillary economic benefit to boot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1789)|
| 0:29:54| but we think that we can do it and not only not make traffic situations worse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1794)|
| 0:29:59| but in some areas actually improve them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1799)|
| 0:30:04| I have to obviously rely on the traffic engineers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1804)|
| 0:30:10| and I know that it's about a 150-page study, and I know what I had to pay for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1810)|
| 0:30:17| so I'm hoping that it's very accurate, and I believe it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1817)|
| 0:30:21| So I'm asking this council, as we go forward, to put a lot of faith in that, as I have also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1821)|
| 0:30:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1826)|
| 0:30:27| And I'll answer any other questions if you'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1827)|
| 0:30:31| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1831)|
| 0:30:32| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1832)|
| 0:30:33| I'd just like to say, you know, last night was a public meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1833)|
| 0:30:37| but there's been several meetings already held,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1837)|
| 0:30:39| and particularly we met for hours with my portion of the First District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1839)|
| 0:30:43| which encompasses Fort Sanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1843)|
| 0:30:45| You know, they're in behind this plan with minimal concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1845)|
| 0:30:50| I appreciate the transparency that you all have shown to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1850)|
| 0:30:53| That's a real plus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1853)|
| 0:30:56| I think you've met with every member of this council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1856)|
| 0:30:58| or at least extended that invitation to do so and thoroughly explain it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1858)|
| 0:31:03| So I'm excited about this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1863)|
| 0:31:04| I think it's going to be good for Knoxville, for my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1864)|
| 0:31:09| You know, I'm particularly excited about that for Knoxville as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1869)|
| 0:31:12| It's going to be a real plus, and I look forward to this plan as it moves forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1872)|
| 0:31:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1878)|
| 0:31:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1879)|
| 0:31:20| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1880)|
| 0:31:21| Yes, I was also in attendance at that public meeting last night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1881)|
| 0:31:25| as well as some members of your administration, Mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1885)|
| 0:31:29| and it was a very informative and productive meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1889)|
| 0:31:34| I want to thank KCDC for allowing the use of their building and host it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1894)|
| 0:31:39| There were a few questions asked about environmental concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1899)|
| 0:31:44| and I think as we go along, those kind of questions will be answered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1904)|
| 0:31:48| but it was a very good meeting last night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1908)|
| 0:31:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1911)|
| 0:31:53| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1913)|
| 0:31:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1914)|
| 0:31:55| I also was at the meeting last night, along with Councilman Saunders, Delvaux, and Brown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1915)|
| 0:32:00| and I had some people surrounding me who were somewhat skeptical about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1920)|
| 0:32:05| and were perhaps naysayers, but they were quite excited with your presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1925)|
| 0:32:10| They see it as very doable and a really positive thing for the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1930)|
| 0:32:15| and a brownfield that is generating nothing other than some ugly things in First Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1935)|
| 0:32:20| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1940)|
| 0:32:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1941)|
| 0:32:22| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1942)|
| 0:32:23| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1943)|
| 0:32:24| I was not at the meeting last night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1944)|
| 0:32:26| I was at a West Hills Neighborhood Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1946)|
| 0:32:29| but I also just want to reiterate I really do appreciate your transparency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1949)|
| 0:32:33| and I also know that, for instance, just to let Council know that a meeting is being arranged with Scenic Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1953)|
| 0:32:39| They're most interested, but Bud has been very cordial in terms of saying, yes, you'll meet with anyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1959)|
| 0:32:45| which I think is a real plus, especially for this project, which is really going to improve a blighted area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1965)|
| 0:32:50| We really appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1970)|
| 0:32:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1972)|
| 0:32:53| And Councilman Delvaux.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1973)|
| 0:32:54| Yes, and I love being positive, but I want to be sure that our city engineers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1974)|
| 0:32:58| especially our traffic engineers, actually go look at that road on the ground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1978)|
| 0:33:02| because you can read a 150-page report all day long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1982)|
| 0:33:06| Yes, there are some short stretches between traffic lights and people trying to get over to Alcoa Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1986)|
| 0:33:12| and it's an opportunity to pucker if it's not done right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=1992)|

| 0:34:37| and I have one who has signed up to speak against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2077)|
| 0:34:43| So, Mr. Seymour, who would you like to start with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2083)|
| 0:34:47| Mayor, members of City Council, Arthur Seymour, Jr., 550 West Main Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2087)|
| 0:34:52| Knoxville, Tennessee, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2092)|
| 0:34:54| You heard me last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2094)|
| 0:34:56| Let's hear from Mr. Graham tonight while I pass out some brochures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2096)|
| 0:35:00| Thank you, Mr. Graham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2100)|
| 0:35:01| If you'd like to state your name and address again for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2101)|
| 0:35:04| And you'll have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2104)|
| 0:35:06| I'm Tim Graham, President, Graham Corporation, 5555 Clinton Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2106)|
| 0:35:17| Two weeks ago I was probably a little unprepared,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2117)|
| 0:35:23| considering that the staff recommended approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2123)|
| 0:35:27| and then, on top of that, the Planning Commission recommended approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2127)|
| 0:35:32| And I heard two main things that I heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2132)|
| 0:35:35| was that I was unaware that the church was against the C3 zoning next to their property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2135)|
| 0:35:44| which is lots 19 and 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2144)|
| 0:35:49| So I heard them loud and clear, and we'll address that in just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2149)|
| 0:35:54| I also heard from maybe more, but specifically Councilman Grieve that, and I quoted him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2154)|
| 0:36:03| he says, I do not know you very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2163)|
| 0:36:05| And so I wanted to address that tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2165)|
| 0:36:07| And in this day of term limits, sometimes when you don't appear before council for a while, you have new faces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2167)|
| 0:36:15| And so I wanted to kind of introduce myself back to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2175)|
| 0:36:19| So what you have in your packet, number one, is a list of Graham Corporation's developments in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2179)|
| 0:36:26| and the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2186)|
| 0:36:28| And I won't bore you with the details, but if you go down to the bottom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2188)|
| 0:36:34| it's approximately 1.4 million square feet of retail development we've done in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2194)|
| 0:36:42| in excess of $100 million of investment in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2202)|
| 0:36:47| So we are extremely invested in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2207)|
| 0:36:52| I'm a lifelong resident, a graduate of UT, and as we say, I'm not going anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2212)|
| 0:36:58| So hopefully I'll be before you a lot more than just this one instant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2218)|
| 0:37:04| Number two packet is a list of simple flyers of these developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2224)|
| 0:37:11| And as you flip through, the first one is Merchant's Town Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2231)|
| 0:37:15| Merchant's Corner is the one right across the street, South Grove, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2235)|
| 0:37:20| So that's some of our developments, all retail developments in the city or county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2240)|
| 0:37:26| Thirdly, the third group that you have, it's a picture of Fountain Square that we developed in 1992.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2246)|
| 0:37:34| It's in Fountain City on Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2254)|
| 0:37:37| We like to call it the Kinko's or the Verizon building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2257)|
| 0:37:42| That was one of the first what we call street front retail that was developed in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2262)|
| 0:37:49| And we, if you flip to the second page, you'll see that MPC thought it deserved an excellence award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2269)|
| 0:37:56| So, and then as you flip on through the properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2276)|
| 0:37:59| the third picture is a picture of the old Super X on the corner of Clinton Highway and Merchant's Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2279)|
| 0:38:09| And then the fourth picture is what's there now, Merchant's Corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2289)|
| 0:38:13| And so you can flip on through the pictures, South Grove and other properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2293)|
| 0:38:17| and you can see the type of development that we're used to doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2297)|
| 0:38:21| which includes the new Cheddar's that's at McLean Road and on this property that's in question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2301)|
| 0:38:28| In addition, you have a Blockbuster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2308)|
| 0:38:30| You have a CVS drugstore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2310)|
| 0:38:32| So we do good development, and that's some examples of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2312)|
| 0:38:39| Lastly, I'd like to note that the, and I think it was mentioned last time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2319)|
| 0:38:44| our expo building received an Orchid Award for the reuse of a big box space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2324)|
| 0:38:50| So that's a second award that we've received for some of our development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2330)|
| 0:38:55| The fourth is about five different properties, starting with Turkey Creek, that have a C4 and a C3 zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2335)|
| 0:39:04| Turkey Creek is a pretty nice project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2344)|
| 0:39:06| Mr. Turley, which we all know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2346)|
| 0:39:10| Sir, you have one minute left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2350)|
| 0:39:12| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2352)|
| 0:39:13| The next project is the Walmart Home Depot in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2353)|
| 0:39:17| And so you have five projects there that are in that zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2357)|
| 0:39:21| The fifth is the letter from New Hope Baptist, Bedford-Chapman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2361)|
| 0:39:25| where he is okay with our C4 zoning as long as he gets his C6 next to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2365)|
| 0:39:32| And so we're agreeable to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2372)|
| 0:39:35| And then the last, or one of the last documents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2375)|
| 0:39:40| shows all the existing buildings that were there about 20 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2380)|
| 0:39:45| If you note on those two sheets, you'll see car lots, you'll see car repairs, sheds, block buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2385)|
| 0:39:53| And then if you look at the last thing, if you'll look at this aerial photograph of Merchantstown Square,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2393)|
| 0:40:03| you'll see that none of that's there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2403)|
| 0:40:05| There's no car lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2405)|
| 0:40:07| We're a good developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2407)|
| 0:40:09| We do projects right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2409)|
| 0:40:11| We're extremely invested in our projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2411)|
| 0:40:14| And lastly, your time is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2414)|
| 0:40:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2416)|
| 0:40:17| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2417)|
| 0:40:18| With the indulgence of council, if we could give him a little additional time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2418)|
| 0:40:22| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2422)|
| 0:40:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2425)|
| 0:40:26| And no objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2426)|
| 0:40:27| Go ahead, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2427)|
| 0:40:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2428)|
| 0:40:30| I noticed, Terry, here a second on the last two exhibits, six and seven, that show what we've done to the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2430)|
| 0:40:43| And you can see on the corner of Merchant's Road a 1960s building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2443)|
| 0:40:49| It's not there anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2449)|
| 0:40:50| It's got a CVS drug store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2450)|
| 0:40:51| Across the street, as I mentioned earlier, is a 1960s building that's gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2451)|
| 0:40:56| It's got Merchant's Corner on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2456)|
| 0:40:58| There's a vacant bank on this picture 20 years ago or 15 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2458)|
| 0:41:03| It's gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2463)|
| 0:41:04| There's a blockbuster that we're now re-tenanting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2464)|
| 0:41:10| There is a former meat market, two car lots, a nursery, a car repair, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2470)|
| 0:41:17| And so when you flip over to what's there now, I think our track record speaks for itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2477)|
| 0:41:24| And so I should note that after reviewing the SC2 zone and compared to the C4 zone, the SC2 doesn't permit hotels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2484)|
| 0:41:41| doesn't permit theaters, movie theaters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2501)|
| 0:41:44| It doesn't permit a library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2504)|
| 0:41:45| We've had discussions in the past with the Norwood Library moving over into our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2505)|
| 0:41:53| It doesn't permit schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2513)|
| 0:41:55| Mr. Cullum just did a school in the old Kroger in Fountain City that's going to be a good success, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2515)|
| 0:42:03| and is a good reuse of that box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2523)|
| 0:42:06| So, and I appreciate your indulgence, I'll just finish up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2526)|
| 0:42:12| Four points in summary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2532)|
| 0:42:15| Our track record speaks for itself throughout the city and specifically on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2535)|
| 0:42:21| I challenge anyone to even suggest that Graham Corporation has ever developed any property irresponsibly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2541)|
| 0:42:28| or the property values have decreased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2548)|
| 0:42:30| They've increased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2550)|
| 0:42:31| We do good retail development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2551)|
| 0:42:34| We've been doing this 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2554)|
| 0:42:35| We deserve to be trusted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2555)|
| 0:42:38| We've earned it from the quality of our developments, from our responsibility as a corporate citizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2558)|
| 0:42:43| And finally, on a lighter note, as the great Ronald Reagan said many years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2563)|
| 0:42:50| is Merchantstown Square better off today than it was 20 years ago?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2570)|
| 0:42:55| And I think he would say yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2575)|
| 0:42:57| So thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2577)|
| 0:42:59| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2579)|
| 0:43:04| Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2584)|
| 0:43:05| Mayor, may I just use two or three minutes to sort of finish up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2585)|
| 0:43:12| I don't know how long Mr. Graham went.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2592)|
| 0:43:16| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2596)|
| 0:43:19| We also have a third speaker, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2599)|
| 0:43:21| Is the third speaker here, too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2601)|
| 0:43:23| Is Mr. Chapman here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2603)|
| 0:43:26| He's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2606)|
| 0:43:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2607)|
| 0:43:28| I won't take my five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2608)|
| 0:43:29| I would just like to emphasize a couple points, follow up what Mr. Graham has said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2609)|
| 0:43:36| If you look at his track record, which is Exhibit 1 in his packet of the development of the Graham Corporation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2616)|
| 0:43:45| the investment, direct investment in the city of Knoxville and Knox County is over $117 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2625)|
| 0:43:52| That's construction jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2632)|
| 0:43:55| That's jobs for people working in the developments in the grocery stores, restaurants, and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2635)|
| 0:44:03| These are all first-class developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2643)|
| 0:44:05| The second thing that Mr. Graham has been able to do over the years is identify underutilized areas of the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2645)|
| 0:44:14| We all know that West Knoxville has West Town, Turkey Creek, Shopping Center after Shopping Center, which are all great developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2654)|
| 0:44:22| But Mr. Graham has taken the lead in areas that have been underdeveloped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2662)|
| 0:44:28| Clinton Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2668)|
| 0:44:30| His developments there at Callahan Road have been first-class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2670)|
| 0:44:37| Chapman Highway, South Grove, is a first-class development there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2677)|
| 0:44:42| That was done with the C3 zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2682)|
| 0:44:45| Also, at East Town, he has put Lowe's in there and several banks and done a first-class job there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2685)|
| 0:44:53| So he is asking permission from this council to have the SC2 part zoned back to C4| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2693)|
| 0:45:06| so he can continue doing the fine job he has done on Clinton Highway, Chapman Highway, and at East Town Mall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2706)|
| 0:45:15| And he has grand plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2715)|
| 0:45:17| It would be nice to stand up here and say, we have this, this, and this coming in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2717)|
| 0:45:22| but the retail environment right now simply is you have got to be flexible to grab whoever is out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2722)|
| 0:45:30| And Cheddar's was a prime example of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2730)|
| 0:45:32| Based on the parking in their car lot, that is a very popular addition to Chapman Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2732)|
| 0:45:38| not only employing a number of people but adding to the streetscape out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2738)|
| 0:45:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2746)|
| 0:45:47| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2747)|
| 0:45:50| Mr. Chapman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2750)|
| 0:45:55| Please state your name and address, and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2755)|
| 0:45:58| Bedford Chapman, 7411 Bridgefield Drive, Palo Alto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2758)|
| 0:46:02| And I would just respectfully withdraw my request to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2762)|
| 0:46:07| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2767)|
| 0:46:10| Okay, those are the speakers in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2770)|
| 0:46:12| We have one speaker signed up opposed to this, and that is Mr. Len Redman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2772)|
| 0:46:17| Mr. Redman, please state your name and address, and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2777)|
| 0:46:28| My name is Len Redman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2788)|
| 0:46:29| I live at 5246 Oak Hill Lane in the Norwood community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2789)|
| 0:46:34| I'm here tonight as President of Norwood Homeowners Association representing our position on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2794)|
| 0:46:39| I found it a very enlightening history of the Graham Corporation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2799)|
| 0:46:44| and history of the little corner up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2804)|
| 0:46:47| Let's talk about now what we're here for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2807)|
| 0:46:50| There's a request before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2810)|
| 0:46:52| It originally came up they wanted two lots rezoned next to New Hope Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2812)|
| 0:46:57| I think everyone has agreed that those are going to stay C6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2817)|
| 0:47:00| That's been our position since day one, and I think most council people are going to support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2820)|
| 0:47:05| The other part of the zoning is 18 acres of shopping center zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2825)|
| 0:47:10| that Mr. Graham wants to take to C4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2830)|
| 0:47:14| Right now it's shopping center 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2834)|
| 0:47:17| If you start at Sharps Ridge on Clinton Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2837)|
| 0:47:23| and you go all the way out to the city limits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2843)|
| 0:47:27| you're going to find several hundred acres of C4 on Clinton Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2847)|
| 0:47:32| You've got some very nice C4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2852)|
| 0:47:34| You've got some C4 that's abandoned, that's up for sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2854)|
| 0:47:37| You've got some up for lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2857)|
| 0:47:39| You've got some that's just been deserted, and we don't know what's happened to the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2859)|
| 0:47:43| You've got some very nice businesses on C4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2863)|
| 0:47:46| You've got some other businesses that are just driving by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2866)|
| 0:47:50| If you're in the real estate business, you can tell these are just shells of businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2870)|
| 0:47:54| We have a glut of C4 on Clinton Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2874)|
| 0:47:59| It's going to take, if the economy picked up right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2879)|
| 0:48:02| we're probably looking at five years for a workout of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2882)|
| 0:48:05| as new businesses and upgrades come to Clinton Highway, and they are coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2885)|
| 0:48:11| Why in heaven's name do we need 18 more acres?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2891)|
| 0:48:16| Now, if you look at Mr. Graham's property map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2896)|
| 0:48:20| he's got shopping center in there that he wants to add 18 acres of C4 to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2900)|
| 0:48:25| But if you look closely at that map, there's over 20 acres of C4 already on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2905)|
| 0:48:32| Our alternative idea is to simply leave it shopping center two, which is a planned zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2912)|
| 0:48:42| That's really the only difference between the two zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2922)|
| 0:48:46| C4, you can get a billing permit that anything fits in the zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2926)|
| 0:48:51| You're on your own then, and the community is on their own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2931)|
| 0:48:54| Are we talking about Mr. Graham doing shoddy work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2934)|
| 0:48:57| Of course not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2937)|
| 0:48:58| We're talking about the person that owns it after Mr. Graham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2938)|
| 0:49:01| And we appreciated him promising he will own it forever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2941)|
| 0:49:04| but that's a little too restrictive to put in a rezoning request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2944)|
| 0:49:10| None of us know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2950)|
| 0:49:11| I've seen five owners of that property in my lifetime there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2951)|
| 0:49:17| I thought it was interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2957)|
| 0:49:18| Mr. Seymour mentioned some property on out Clinton Highway that has a Kroger, a Target, a Lowe's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2958)|
| 0:49:28| and several other businesses, and he called it first class, and it was developed by Mr. Graham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2968)|
| 0:49:34| First class is in the eye of the beholder, but I will point out one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2974)|
| 0:49:39| All of those were planned zones out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2979)|
| 0:49:41| So it's not impossible to do development like every other developer occasionally in a planned zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2981)|
| 0:49:47| One was PC1, the other one was PC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2987)|
| 0:49:52| One was city and one was county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2992)|
| 0:49:54| And the first thing that they require in a planned zone is you submit your development plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=2994)|
| 0:50:01| let it go before MPC, and they approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3001)|
| 0:50:06| As far as uses for the property under shopping center, I don't want to talk about what might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3006)|
| 0:50:11| I want to talk about what goes on there already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3011)|
| 0:50:14| We sell boats there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3014)|
| 0:50:16| We sell travel trailers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3016)|
| 0:50:19| We sell motor homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3019)|
| 0:50:22| We have flea markets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3022)|
| 0:50:24| And in the last 50 years that I've lived around that property, I've never seen a band of codes inspectors come out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3024)|
| 0:50:31| and shut a business down in that shopping center zone because the business didn't fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3031)|
| 0:50:36| Sir, you have one minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3036)|
| 0:50:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3037)|
| 0:50:39| What we're asking for is a simple, let's leave it alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3039)|
| 0:50:43| You know, if something comes up when Mr. Graham finds a tenant, you know, it's always available to be opened up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3043)|
| 0:50:50| But we're not talking about Tim Graham here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3050)|
| 0:50:52| We're talking about the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3052)|
| 0:50:55| And we're talking about the next owner and the owner after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3055)|
| 0:50:58| And we're here also to announce a little thing to the new administration and new members of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3058)|
| 0:51:04| We don't want to be the stereotypical Norwood of 10 or 20 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3064)|
| 0:51:11| We have a lot of good things happening in our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3071)|
| 0:51:13| There's going to be a lot of good development there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3073)|
| 0:51:16| We want a little bit of protection down the road, and that's all we're asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3076)|
| 0:51:20| We hope you will support our position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3080)|
| 0:51:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3082)|
| 0:51:23| Thank you, Mr. Redman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3083)|
| 0:51:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3085)|
| 0:51:26| Councilman Della Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3086)|
| 0:51:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3088)|
| 0:51:29| Mr. Donaldson, I'm not sure who to address it to, but I think maybe Mr. Donaldson and Mr. Graham both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3089)|
| 0:51:35| I'll start with Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3095)|
| 0:51:37| I understand where we were as of the last meeting, and that was that we said C6 on parcels 19 and 20, those near the church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3097)|
| 0:51:50| so that there would be a plan review before something was built there to assure that there's no interference with the church property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3110)|
| 0:51:59| The issue that's on the table now is what happens to the 18 or 18-plus acres that's going from SC2 to C4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3119)|
| 0:52:12| And what I want you to address is tell us a little bit about the plan review process, how much time that takes to get through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3132)|
| 0:52:22| and then I guess, Mr. Graham, I'd like you to comment why that causes you a problem, because that's really the crux of this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3142)|
| 0:52:28| Everyone that I hear saying things at this podium, at the meeting in Norwood, at the last council meeting was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3148)|
| 0:52:36| Tim Graham does good work, we're not concerned about him as a developer, we are rezoning land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3156)|
| 0:52:41| is there a problem with an advance notice so the community has its say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3161)|
| 0:52:46| So if you would just briefly tell us about SC2 and or any other zone that has sort of a stop at your office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3166)|
| 0:52:54| before the grater hits the ground, I guess, is the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3174)|
| 0:52:59| The SC2 zone district is one that we call a planned zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3179)|
| 0:53:05| It requires that prior to any building permits being issued that a development plan is approved by the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3185)|
| 0:53:13| If someone were to absolutely nail the application timeline, you could get that approved within five weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3193)|
| 0:53:23| If you miss it by a day, you're looking at eight to nine weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3203)|
| 0:53:27| If there's an appeal, which can happen, planning commission decisions are appealable to the city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3207)|
| 0:53:37| then you extend that by another month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3217)|
| 0:53:40| So best case scenario, four to five weeks from the time that you make application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3220)|
| 0:53:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3228)|
| 0:53:49| The second part of that is, is there any other planned zone that gets that same look-see that maybe is different than SC2?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3229)|
| 0:53:57| You made a comment last time that there was a laundry list in SC2, and Mr. Graham alluded to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3237)|
| 0:54:03| that some of the things don't fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3243)|
| 0:54:05| So is there a planned zone that's better than that for this type of development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3245)|
| 0:54:10| The most comparable other planned zone district is PC1, which is titled Retail and Office Park District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3250)|
| 0:54:20| It has the same development plan approval process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3260)|
| 0:54:23| It has a shorter list of permitted uses than the SC2, which builds upon SC1, so it's kind of cumulative that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3263)|
| 0:54:32| So it's a bit more narrowly defined than the shopping center district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3272)|
| 0:54:37| Mr. Graham, I read your testimony before the MPC, but flexibility was important to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3277)|
| 0:54:43| in building individual pads as opposed to a strip mall development type,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3283)|
| 0:54:50| were reasons why you thought this C4 zone was a better one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3290)|
| 0:54:54| Do you want to address the question that the neighborhood has raised is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3294)|
| 0:54:57| why can't they sort of have a look-see before the dozer hits the ground?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3297)|
| 0:55:03| Well, let me bring you back to the last number seven that I gave you that actually showed the aerial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3303)|
| 0:55:10| but also shows a current site plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3310)|
| 0:55:19| Without knowing exactly who the tenant may be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3319)|
| 0:55:23| I can pretty much bet that when you try to merge C4 and SC2 in some overall plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3323)|
| 0:55:33| that you're going to have some conflicts where the property line or where the zoning line falls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3333)|
| 0:55:40| You may run into one's got one setback and one's got another and different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3340)|
| 0:55:47| I just think you're going to complicate the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3347)|
| 0:55:51| I think the one point that I wanted to make earlier is that if you look at this site plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3351)|
| 0:56:00| you can see the property to the left where it says C6 and where we have graded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3360)|
| 0:56:08| and as soon as the weather breaks we'll pave a new drive that lines up with Tillery Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3368)|
| 0:56:15| We've invested, if I recall, over $2 million just building those paths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3375)|
| 0:56:22| So, if you want to talk about protection for the city or the neighborhood, why in the world,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3382)|
| 0:56:28| and, of course, up here we have over $10 million invested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3388)|
| 0:56:32| why would we do anything to hurt our $2 million investment because of a zone, because of a use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3392)|
| 0:56:42| That's a big investment we made here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3402)|
| 0:56:44| In addition, the CVS is a 50-year lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3404)|
| 0:56:48| It's not going anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3408)|
| 0:56:49| The Firestone is a long-term lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3409)|
| 0:56:51| The Blockbuster has been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3411)|
| 0:56:53| We're retooling it, but it's not a new building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3413)|
| 0:56:56| So, as you go up, you know, our frontage is pretty much developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3416)|
| 0:56:59| So, there's very little risk and it's just, with all due respect to Mr. Redman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3419)|
| 0:57:08| he's not developed shopping centers and dealing with zones and dealing with permitting and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3428)|
| 0:57:14| Will we demo the Kroger so maybe the city can widen Merchants Road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3434)|
| 0:57:19| Sure, we'll look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3439)|
| 0:57:21| Will that permit maybe outlots down through there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3441)|
| 0:57:23| Maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3443)|
| 0:57:25| But as I allude to, I just realized this just not too long ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3445)|
| 0:57:30| but the shopping center zone does not permit hotels, theaters, a library, or schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3450)|
| 0:57:38| Now, that was just a quick look-see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3458)|
| 0:57:41| And C-4 does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3461)|
| 0:57:43| And it's consistent with what we already have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3463)|
| 0:57:47| This day and time of development, I don't think it's a time to make it difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3467)|
| 0:57:53| It's a time to help the developer, help people that are trying to invest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3473)|
| 0:57:56| We are investing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3476)|
| 0:57:58| We're investing in the worst time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3478)|
| 0:58:00| We spend a lot of money in the worst time getting ready for that next tenant, whether that's similar to cheddar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3480)|
| 0:58:09| So, we are we want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3489)|
| 0:58:14| That's one thing that we have done well, too, councilman, is when we sit across from a retailer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3494)|
| 0:58:21| we want to be able to make a deal and say, yes, you can do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3501)|
| 0:58:25| And it's important because it seems like they may take forever to finally get to the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3505)|
| 0:58:30| but once they're at the table, they're ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3510)|
| 0:58:32| And so, I think that's one of the reasons we have so many projects in here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3512)|
| 0:58:37| because we know how to make a deal with a retailer and we know how to perform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3517)|
| 0:58:41| And so, I don't know if that answered everything that you asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3521)|
| 0:58:47| No, but that's what I wanted to hear, because, I mean, that's the nub of this dispute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3527)|
| 0:58:50| It's not that you're doing band projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3530)|
| 0:58:52| It's not that Clinton Highway isn't on the upswing, which is a healthy, good thing for this city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3532)|
| 0:58:57| and the communities around here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3537)|
| 0:58:59| The tough question is the neighborhood feels like it's on the outside looking in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3539)|
| 0:59:03| and maybe you're going to propose or do something that affects them adversely or some successor to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3543)|
| 0:59:09| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3549)|
| 0:59:10| Because you sell or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3550)|
| 0:59:11| And they're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3551)|
| 0:59:12| You've got CVS there for a long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3552)|
| 0:59:14| You have Firestone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3554)|
| 0:59:15| You have all these pads that are there, built, ready, waiting on Kohl's or Best Buy or Publix, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3555)|
| 0:59:25| So it's just common sense of what we've proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3565)|
| 0:59:32| And our track record, I think, really speaks for itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3572)|
| 0:59:35| And there are different permitted uses in C4 that aren't in the SC2, which I've already alluded to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3575)|
| 0:59:43| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3583)|
| 0:59:44| And, Mayor, with your indulgence, could I ask Mr. Redman to speak to that for less than a minute, if you can?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3584)|
| 0:59:50| This is the crux of this dispute here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3590)|
| 0:59:52| Let's just get it out on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3592)|
| 0:59:55| Well, again, I'll read you from City of Knoxville Code of Ordinances, Shopping Center 2, Shopping Center 3, uses permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3595)|
| 1:00:03| Any other use, any other store or shop for retail trade or for rendering personal or professional service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3603)|
| 1:00:10| in which, in the opinion of the Planning Commission, will not be injurious to the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3610)|
| 1:00:15| That leaves Shopping Center 2 open to just about any proposed thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3615)|
| 1:00:21| Again, we have 50 years of practice by the City Business License Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3621)|
| 1:00:28| They've never turned down, as far as we could find, a single use for this property over the years when it was zoned Shopping Center 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3628)|
| 1:00:39| We appreciate, and we're not trying to slow down Mr. Graham or anything, but we're talking about zoning the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3639)|
| 1:00:46| We're not zoning Mr. Graham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3646)|
| 1:00:48| We appreciate a little control over the next guy and the next gal that owns the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3648)|
| 1:00:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3654)|
| 1:00:55| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3655)|
| 1:00:57| Thank you, Madam Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3657)|
| 1:00:59| Mr. Graham, where did you go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3659)|
| 1:01:01| There you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3661)|
| 1:01:05| Following up on Councilman DellaVolpe's remarks, everybody agrees that you have done good projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3665)|
| 1:01:13| Nobody's argued with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3673)|
| 1:01:15| And I talked to one of your partners this afternoon about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3675)|
| 1:01:19| Some of the discomfort, I think, that is felt perhaps by the neighbors and the residents in that area is exactly what Mr. Redman just said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3679)|
| 1:01:29| and it's the long-term disposition of that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3689)|
| 1:01:34| Obviously, if you clean it up as this, I think, is partly an attempt to do, clean up the zoning, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3694)|
| 1:01:43| then, in my mind at least, and I'm not a developer, that also makes it more marketable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3703)|
| 1:01:49| Now, maybe it makes it more marketable to the retail tenant and so forth, perhaps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3709)|
| 1:01:56| but it makes it more marketable in my mind, and perhaps Mr. Wallace could address some of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3716)|
| 1:02:04| So what I want is assurance that you have not or are not engaged in negotiation with some party,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3724)|
| 1:02:13| and I don't really care who, to dispose of that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3733)|
| 1:02:18| No, sir, not at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3738)|
| 1:02:19| We're going on 20 years owning pieces of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3739)|
| 1:02:24| We've assembled it, I think we started in the early to mid-90s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3744)|
| 1:02:29| and we have no intention to dispose of it, to, you know, just flip it or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3749)|
| 1:02:39| We are very blessed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3759)|
| 1:02:41| We've come through this economy better than ever, and we have very little debt on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3761)|
| 1:02:47| We've invested some of our 1031 tax-free funds, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3767)|
| 1:02:52| So we tend to see it through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3772)|
| 1:02:55| And one other point is once a property, if you go around once a center or a big office building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3775)|
| 1:03:02| or something developed, generally it doesn't change for many, many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3782)|
| 1:03:06| It takes a lot of, I guess, dish repair to tear down a center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3786)|
| 1:03:15| For like Clinton Plaza just down the road, they've redone that once, twice, three times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3795)|
| 1:03:20| and food city is in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3800)|
| 1:03:22| And, you know, it's still what it was originally, still laid out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3802)|
| 1:03:29| The buildings are still there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3809)|
| 1:03:30| So, but, no, we have no intention to flip the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3810)|
| 1:03:35| Thank you for your comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3815)|
| 1:03:36| I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3816)|
| 1:03:37| My office is also on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3817)|
| 1:03:39| I know it is, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3819)|
| 1:03:41| I will simply end my remarks by saying we just had a developer up here with the University Commons, Mr. Cullum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3821)|
| 1:03:47| who engaged in a very public process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3827)|
| 1:03:50| And I encourage that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3830)|
| 1:03:52| I encourage the transparency that they have made evident and ask you to consider that the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3832)|
| 1:03:58| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3838)|
| 1:03:59| Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3839)|
| 1:04:01| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3841)|
| 1:04:02| Mr. Graham, I respect you and your developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3842)|
| 1:04:04| I don't have a problem with some of the quality things you've built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3844)|
| 1:04:09| One thing I haven't heard and really hasn't alleviated my concerns about the zoning to C6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3849)|
| 1:04:17| I mean, you've got C6 on 19 and 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3857)|
| 1:04:20| And to go from C or, excuse me, SC2 to C6 would allow, I believe, and I can be corrected, Mr. Donson, a hotel, a theater,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3860)|
| 1:04:31| a library, a school, those things you mentioned that might want to be put on this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3871)|
| 1:04:36| along with other pad-type developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3876)|
| 1:04:39| All it does is allow a plan to be presented on a major, you know, intersection on 18 acres going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3879)|
| 1:04:48| And I, too, think bringing a plan forward would be attractive to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3888)|
| 1:04:54| And that's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3894)|
| 1:04:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3896)|
| 1:04:58| Councilman Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3898)|
| 1:05:00| I just want to reiterate the remarks I made last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3900)|
| 1:05:04| I mean, this is 18 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3904)|
| 1:05:06| It's in a key spot, you know, probably one of the most important spots on Clinton Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3906)|
| 1:05:12| It's 18 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3912)|
| 1:05:13| It's a large tract of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3913)|
| 1:05:16| I think it was zoned C2 for a reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3916)|
| 1:05:18| And there's a lot of C4 around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3918)|
| 1:05:20| But I think because it's important, it was zoned C2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3920)|
| 1:05:23| It's a planned zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3923)|
| 1:05:25| And, you know, SC2, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3925)|
| 1:05:29| It's a planned zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3929)|
| 1:05:32| It's important to the community that we're able to review what's going in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3932)|
| 1:05:37| We don't need more used car lots and tire shops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3937)|
| 1:05:41| And I'm not saying that's what's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3941)|
| 1:05:43| I think there's tremendous potential for this corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3943)|
| 1:05:46| But if we just blanket rezone it, there's potential for it to be tremendously bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3946)|
| 1:05:51| And we'll never have a say about it if we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3951)|
| 1:05:55| And I think it's also important to note that, I mean, I've seen a lot of pictures of other developments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3955)|
| 1:06:03| but I haven't seen any proposals for this land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3963)|
| 1:06:06| We're not stopping by voting no any development that I've heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3966)|
| 1:06:13| We're just, I mean, this is just a proposal to rezone this huge piece of property to C4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3973)|
| 1:06:19| and then we hope that it's developed well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3979)|
| 1:06:22| Well, you know, we can hope and look at these pictures and feel good about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3982)|
| 1:06:27| but, I mean, I'm not going to vote just on hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3987)|
| 1:06:30| So, you know, I'd like to see some plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3990)|
| 1:06:33| I think, you know, this corner is important, and so I'll be voting against the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=3993)|
| 1:06:40| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4000)|
| 1:06:42| Well, I think that this is a lot different development than what was presented to us before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4002)|
| 1:06:50| And this is a multi-tenant, multi-building development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4010)|
| 1:06:55| He needs all the flexibility in the world to attract these type of tenants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4015)|
| 1:07:00| They don't come by often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4020)|
| 1:07:02| As Mr. Donaldson just pointed out, he said six to eight weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4022)|
| 1:07:06| That's the best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4026)|
| 1:07:08| That's with no appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4028)|
| 1:07:10| So you've got to wait out the appeal time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4030)|
| 1:07:12| And a lot of people are not willing to wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4032)|
| 1:07:14| This is a very competitive market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4034)|
| 1:07:17| You need all the flexibility in the world to build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4037)|
| 1:07:19| And when someone says go, you have to hit the ground running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4039)|
| 1:07:22| That's why he's out there grading these properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4042)|
| 1:07:25| He's investing money in these, cash money into these properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4045)|
| 1:07:28| in order to get them ready to be shovel ready in order for somebody to make it attractive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4048)|
| 1:07:35| C-4 is consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4055)|
| 1:07:37| This is not anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4057)|
| 1:07:38| It's all over that map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4058)|
| 1:07:40| It's on three sides of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4060)|
| 1:07:42| So it's not anything he's asking for that is outlandish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4062)|
| 1:07:47| I mean, you've got to consider the worthiness of the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4067)|
| 1:07:52| He's done great work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4072)|
| 1:07:54| And it's not going to be one big box tenant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4074)|
| 1:07:57| That's not the market he's in out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4077)|
| 1:07:59| So it's going to be multi-buildings, and he's got to be ready to develop it, just like he was with Cheddar's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4079)|
| 1:08:06| He had the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4086)|
| 1:08:07| He was ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4087)|
| 1:08:08| And this is a guy you can trust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4088)|
| 1:08:10| And he's done great work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4090)|
| 1:08:11| There's still a great amount of buffer zone between this property and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4091)|
| 1:08:17| and it adjoins Ferdona Road in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4097)|
| 1:08:20| So I think it's very doable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4100)|
| 1:08:23| I think it's very reasonable, and I definitely support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4103)|
| 1:08:27| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4107)|
| 1:08:29| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4109)|
| 1:08:30| First of all, I want to thank Mr. Graham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4110)|
| 1:08:32| We did have the opportunity to meet and get together and discuss not only this project but his other projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4112)|
| 1:08:38| And as I explained to him, that basically philosophically he and I just disagree in terms of what the zoning ought to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4118)|
| 1:08:46| I'm not looking at Mr. Graham so much as I am the property and where this property is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4126)|
| 1:08:52| And if I look on the map and see if the existing buildings stay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4132)|
| 1:08:56| I only see about three or four sites where there might be buildings that show on this particular plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4136)|
| 1:09:03| But, again, I think that we need to raise the bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4143)|
| 1:09:09| We need to be better maybe than just what our zoning ordinance is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4149)|
| 1:09:13| And I think we have an opportunity here to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4153)|
| 1:09:16| I think as we spoke the last time, this is a pretty important piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4156)|
| 1:09:20| And, again, the way I vote has nothing to do with a distrust for Mr. Graham or for the work that he's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4160)|
| 1:09:28| But I do think that we need to take a very serious look at the property and realize that's what we're zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4168)|
| 1:09:37| Councilman Campin, is that an old light on there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4177)|
| 1:09:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4179)|
| 1:09:41| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4181)|
| 1:09:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4183)|
| 1:09:44| I represent the third district where Mr. Graham's property is located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4184)|
| 1:09:48| It's within the Norwood community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4188)|
| 1:09:50| And I looked up some information about the Norwood community to be sure that I was correct in my thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4190)|
| 1:09:57| There are 15,000 people who live in the city data area defined as Norwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4197)|
| 1:10:03| Mr. Redmond, pardon me, I forgot your name for a second, does represent a segment of that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4203)|
| 1:10:14| I also heard today from a segment of the community who supports Mr. Graham's request for C-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4214)|
| 1:10:20| They have confidence that he will develop this land appropriately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4220)|
| 1:10:25| They are concerned and interested in jobs for the community, which this would provide as it's developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4225)|
| 1:10:33| This property is on the CAT bus line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4233)|
| 1:10:36| There's regular service because I have a number of my constituents who live in that area who talk to me about CAT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4236)|
| 1:10:42| and give reports from time to time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4242)|
| 1:10:45| There is a library in Norwood in District 5, Mr. Campin's district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4245)|
| 1:10:52| And that library is pretty small and pretty inadequate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4252)|
| 1:10:55| And I think if there's an opportunity to put a library on the property Mr. Graham has or some similar property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4255)|
| 1:11:02| that would be a very, very positive thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4262)|
| 1:11:05| There are no theaters or movie houses in the Norwood area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4265)|
| 1:11:08| and that area also serves Cumberland Estates off of Western Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4268)|
| 1:11:13| And so that's another opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4273)|
| 1:11:17| I think one of the things about Mr. Graham that I most appreciate is not what's going to happen to this land down the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4277)|
| 1:11:27| because that's a question we need to ask about every zoning issue that comes before this council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4287)|
| 1:11:33| But Mr. Graham doesn't take the easy pieces of property to develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4293)|
| 1:11:37| He goes into parts of the city that are generally considered by most developers to not be very desirable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4297)|
| 1:11:44| They either because of the income levels, because of the housing around, are not quick turnover, easy buck areas to develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4304)|
| 1:11:53| And Mr. Graham has demonstrated time and time again that he's willing to invest in all parts of our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4313)|
| 1:12:00| Not only has he invested within the Norwood area and on Clinton Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4320)|
| 1:12:04| he's given us examples of development in South Knoxville, in North Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4324)|
| 1:12:10| and I have heard from several people that he has looked at some property in East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4330)|
| 1:12:16| So he is not taking the easy way out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4336)|
| 1:12:19| He's not taking the inexpensive way out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4339)|
| 1:12:22| And I think that we have to have a level of trust in Mr. Graham,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4342)|
| 1:12:26| that he's going to develop a property that will serve not only the 15,000 residents of Norwood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4346)|
| 1:12:32| but make it attractive to other areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4352)|
| 1:12:34| When he brought the Cheddars to that piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4354)|
| 1:12:37| there were a lot of people who didn't know what Cheddars was because they had not been on Alcoa Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4357)|
| 1:12:43| Now they all seem to know, and it's virtually impossible to get in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4363)|
| 1:12:47| As a matter of fact, there will be a Cheddars in West Knoxville before too long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4367)|
| 1:12:51| and that's not part of his development, so we won't talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4371)|
| 1:12:55| But I will be supporting his request tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4375)|
| 1:12:57| I think the C6 is appropriate for the two parcels adjacent to the church that we've agreed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4377)|
| 1:13:02| But I do think that Mr. Graham needs the flexibility to be able to act quickly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4382)|
| 1:13:07| as Councilman Wallace says, when someone comes in and wants to move on that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4387)|
| 1:13:12| and not say, gee, guys, we'd love to have you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4392)|
| 1:13:15| but it could take 13 to 15 to 20 weeks before we can do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4395)|
| 1:13:20| Because if you've got somebody in the pocket with the money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4400)|
| 1:13:23| and they're ready to go on a good development, you need to act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4403)|
| 1:13:26| And I think that those of us who are not in that day-to-day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4406)|
| 1:13:31| may not appreciate that as much as those who are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4411)|
| 1:13:34| So I will be supporting Mr. Graham's request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4414)|
| 1:13:37| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4417)|
| 1:13:39| All right, seeing no further lights, we have a motion and a second to approve the rezoning here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4419)|
| 1:13:45| Ms. Mitchell, will you please call the roll?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4425)|
| 1:13:48| Just to clarify, the rezoning is C6 on parcels 19 and 20| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4428)|
| 1:13:53| and then the C4 on the balance of the track?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4433)|
| 1:13:56| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4436)|
| 1:13:59| Councilman Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4439)|
| 1:14:01| I'm going to vote yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4441)|
| 1:14:02| Councilman Campin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4442)|
| 1:14:03| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4443)|
| 1:14:04| Councilman Della Volpe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4444)|
| 1:14:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4446)|
| 1:14:07| Councilman Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4447)|
| 1:14:08| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4448)|
| 1:14:09| Councilman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4449)|
| 1:14:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4450)|
| 1:14:11| Councilman Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4451)|
| 1:14:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4452)|
| 1:14:13| Councilman Saunders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4453)|
| 1:14:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4454)|
| 1:14:15| Councilman Steyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4455)|
| 1:14:16| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4456)|
| 1:14:17| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4457)|
| 1:14:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4458)|
| 1:14:21| Okay, it's 6-4-3 again, so the motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4461)|
| 1:14:28| 10A is a resolution approving an appeal by Fountain City Community Awareness Network| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4468)|
| 1:14:33| of the Board of Zoning Appeals decision approving the determination and decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4473)|
| 1:14:37| by the city administration officer that the proposed use is an accessory use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4477)|
| 1:14:42| and further appealing the issuance of a building permit for a crematory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4482)|
| 1:14:45| at the funeral home located at 5301 Fountain Drive, 4th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4485)|
| 1:14:51| Okay, we have several people signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4491)|
| 1:14:54| Does Council wish to hear from them first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4494)|
| 1:14:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4497)|
| 1:15:01| We will first hear from the appellants, and we have three people signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4501)|
| 1:15:05| Jamie Rowe is first, and please say your name and address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4505)|
| 1:15:09| and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4509)|
| 1:15:11| Hi, Jamie Rowe, 4215 Tazewell Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4511)|
| 1:15:15| Please direct your attention to our spiral notebook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4515)|
| 1:15:18| It's a table of contents, several maps, photos, letters, health concerns, and other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4518)|
| 1:15:25| If you'll just turn to that first page after the table of contents, the one that's horizontal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4525)|
| 1:15:31| I would just kind of like to go over that briefly with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4531)|
| 1:15:33| It kind of summarizes some of the problems that we've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4533)|
| 1:15:38| We named this sheet the Gentry-Griffey Claims versus the Facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4538)|
| 1:15:43| They claim that the crematory is solely for families using Gentry-Griffey, but no, that's not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4543)|
| 1:15:50| They're marketing in the crematory in Knox and other counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4550)|
| 1:15:56| They ask for an accessory use, and the first permit application was for ten hours daily, six days a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4556)|
| 1:16:03| The issued permit is 16 hours daily, seven days a week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4563)|
| 1:16:08| which would conceivably be 1,400 cremations in a year, which would far surpass accessory use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4568)|
| 1:16:15| They did 70 funerals last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4575)|
| 1:16:19| The crematory will be the principal use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4579)|
| 1:16:23| They continue to claim in the paper and in public meetings, quote, only heat is emitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4583)|
| 1:16:31| but yet their permit list even lists particulates, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4591)|
| 1:16:38| fluorides, and organic compounds as air contaminants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4598)|
| 1:16:42| They have continually said no smoke, no odor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4602)|
| 1:16:47| And in Blount County, the crematory, there's visible smoke,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4607)|
| 1:16:52| and they're even allowed to smoke for up to six minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4612)|
| 1:16:55| And I think that is what is allowed for him, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4615)|
| 1:16:59| And if you'll look at the pages right behind that of the photos, you'll see one photo of smoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4619)|
| 1:17:06| These were taken this week, yesterday and today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4626)|
| 1:17:09| One shows you the stack where you can see that there is noticeable carbonized matter from the residue of the smoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4629)|
| 1:17:20| The other one shows the stack with smoke leaving it during a cremation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4640)|
| 1:17:25| This is not a particularly bad one, but it does prove another misrepresentation by the Gentry Griffey Group to the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4645)|
| 1:17:35| to codes, to the Knox County Air Pollution Control Board that only heat and water are emitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4655)|
| 1:17:45| And a passerby even remarked that often the smoke and odor were very much worse than what it was the last day or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4665)|
| 1:17:53| Opacity is the percent that an air pollutant will obscure the view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4673)|
| 1:17:59| Their machine allows 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4679)|
| 1:18:01| In Blount County, the opacity is 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4681)|
| 1:18:04| February, the valuation for the addition was listed on the permit as 135,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4684)|
| 1:18:10| In July, that valuation was changed to 305,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4690)|
| 1:18:15| And at BCA, Mr. Seymour reported a valuation of 371,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4695)|
| 1:18:22| They continue to claim no mercury.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4702)|
| 1:18:25| However, Mr. William Shaw of the Knox County Air Pollution Control Board came to a meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4705)|
| 1:18:30| openly said that he estimated it at four grams of vaporized mercury per cremation would be released by Gentry Griffey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4710)|
| 1:18:40| No health concerns have been told to us over and over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4720)|
| 1:18:44| However, there's a thing in your packet about the World Health Organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4724)|
| 1:18:48| that recommends promoting effective ways to control mercury emissions from cremation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4728)|
| 1:18:55| Inhalation of mercury vapor can produce harmful effects to nervous, digestive, immune systems, lungs, kidneys, and even be fatal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4735)|
| 1:19:02| The goal with the World Health Organization is to eliminate the release of mercury.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4742)|
| 1:19:09| Mr. Seymour noted that cremation is now up to 35% in 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4749)|
| 1:19:16| And by 2016, burial and cremation rates are expected to be equal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4756)|
| 1:19:22| So, again, we're concerned about accessory use versus principal use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4762)|
| 1:19:27| They have told us it's a very controlled, very regulated business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4767)|
| 1:19:33| Actually, the state and the city do not measure emissions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4773)|
| 1:19:37| The Knox County Pollution Control Board has made it clear they check records that the crematory keeps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4777)|
| 1:19:44| and the unit will not necessarily even be in operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4784)|
| 1:19:46| Ms. Rowe, you have 30 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4786)|
| 1:19:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4788)|
| 1:19:49| In operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4789)|
| 1:19:50| Madam Mayor, I'd ask that we suspend the rules and give them time to address this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4790)|
| 1:19:53| This is an important issue, and they're trying to present the facts to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4793)|
| 1:19:57| So, second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4797)|
| 1:19:59| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4799)|
| 1:20:00| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4800)|
| 1:20:02| The unit will not necessarily even be in operation when they make their inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4802)|
| 1:20:08| They asserted on their website in different places that the Clean Air Act has updated national air quality standards for all times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4808)|
| 1:20:15| Ms. Rowe, just for a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4815)|
| 1:20:16| Is there any objection from counsel to extending the time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4816)|
| 1:20:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4821)|
| 1:20:22| Proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4822)|
| 1:20:23| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4823)|
| 1:20:24| I thought you had voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4824)|
| 1:20:25| You know, I think we need to clarify that, too, that we will give both sides equal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4825)|
| 1:20:29| Both sides, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4829)|
| 1:20:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4830)|
| 1:20:31| I'm keeping time here, so we'll know how much you side got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4831)|
| 1:20:35| For all types of pollutant sources and crematories were not considered for any further federal regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4835)|
| 1:20:42| However, the funeral industry lobbied to be exempted from all federal regulations several years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4842)|
| 1:20:50| and they were exempted from regulations as crematories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4850)|
| 1:20:54| So, of course, they wouldn't have any further ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4854)|
| 1:20:56| They don't have any now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4856)|
| 1:20:58| The Mount Juliet case that was mentioned at BCA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4858)|
| 1:21:01| the second issue was did the board act arbitrarily and capriciously in interpreting the zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4861)|
| 1:21:08| to conclude the intention of the city was to place crematories in an industrial zoning classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4868)|
| 1:21:16| Well, we don't have to worry about that in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4876)|
| 1:21:19| Our zoning ordinance is very clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4879)|
| 1:21:22| Determinations on incinerators have been being done since before 1993.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4882)|
| 1:21:27| I-3 prohibits them, and I-4 zone allows under a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4887)|
| 1:21:34| In conclusion, I would just like to say that the purposes of zoning are to keep like uses together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4894)|
| 1:21:41| promote and protect public health, safety, welfare, character, stability of areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4901)|
| 1:21:46| reduce congestion on streets, protect against noxious fumes, odor, smoke, and other nuisances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4906)|
| 1:21:51| and conserve our taxable value of land and buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4911)|
| 1:21:55| Every single land use has an impact, and very few of them are massive changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4915)|
| 1:22:01| They're little changes that pick away at the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4921)|
| 1:22:05| And this decision is a change that would weaken the fabric of Fountain City,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4925)|
| 1:22:10| and it could change the fabric of our entire city if this becomes a precedent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4930)|
| 1:22:15| We could even have as many as three crematories in Fountain City in a radius of two miles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4935)|
| 1:22:21| We respectfully ask that you rescind this decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4941)|
| 1:22:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4944)|
| 1:22:25| Thank you, Mrs. Rowe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4945)|
| 1:22:27| Okay, just for the audience and anybody watching,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4947)|
| 1:22:30| council rules do typically call for up to three speakers for each side and a maximum of five minutes each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4950)|
| 1:22:36| However, council can request that we suspend those rules and let a speaker go on further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4956)|
| 1:22:43| So I will let you know when it's five minutes, and if you wish for the speaker to continue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4963)|
| 1:22:49| or would you just like to let each of these three speakers speak as long as they want?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4969)|
| 1:22:56| Okay, I'm going to tell you when it's five minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4976)|
| 1:22:59| and then you all can decide whether you'd like to extend more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4979)|
| 1:23:02| Okay, the next speaker is Dr. Nan Scott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4982)|
| 1:23:04| Let me get my timer ready here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4984)|
| 1:23:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4990)|
| 1:23:12| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4992)|
| 1:23:14| My name is Dr. Nan Scott, 315 Oak Park Drive in Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4994)|
| 1:23:18| I'm here representing the Fountain City Community Awareness Network,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=4998)|
| 1:23:22| and I'd like to ask the people who are here with me to stand, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5002)|
| 1:23:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5010)|
| 1:23:32| Fountain City is not a throwaway community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5012)|
| 1:23:36| We appealed this decision partly because a crematory will have a damaging effect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5016)|
| 1:23:42| on the fabric of this thriving historic community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5022)|
| 1:23:47| Article 2 of the Zoning Ordinance clearly defines accessory use as customarily incidental subordinate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5027)|
| 1:23:56| Article 5, Section 4A, accessory use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5036)|
| 1:24:00| Each permitted accessory use shall, one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5040)|
| 1:24:03| be customarily incidental to the principal use established on the same lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5043)|
| 1:24:08| two, be subordinate and serve such principal use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5048)|
| 1:24:12| three, be subordinate in area, extent, and purpose to such principal use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5052)|
| 1:24:17| four, contribute to the comfort, convenience, or necessity of users of such principal use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5057)|
| 1:24:23| These are the criteria Mr. Reynolds uses in the determination,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5063)|
| 1:24:27| but several of these are absolutely not met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5067)|
| 1:24:31| It is not customarily incidental in Knoxville to bring a body to a funeral home for cremation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5071)|
| 1:24:39| In Knoxville, the funeral home customarily takes them somewhere else for cremation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5079)|
| 1:24:46| Most are part owners of the one in Maryville in an industrial park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5086)|
| 1:24:51| and an industrial park is where a crematory would be if there was one in Knoxville now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5091)|
| 1:24:58| It certainly isn't subordinate to the principal use if they were allowed to do cremations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5098)|
| 1:25:03| 16 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year, up to 1,456 cremations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5103)|
| 1:25:14| They had 70 funerals last year at Gentry Griffey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5114)|
| 1:25:17| Two cremations a week would far exceed the funerals last year, and that is not subordinate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5117)|
| 1:25:25| It doesn't contribute to the comfort, convenience, or necessity of users of principal use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5125)|
| 1:25:31| if Gentry Griffey is marketing to other counties, and they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5131)|
| 1:25:36| And Gentry Griffey is also trying to market the crematory to all clients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5136)|
| 1:25:40| who use the Blount County Crematory in the industrial park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5140)|
| 1:25:45| What it contributes to is Gentry Griffey's pocketbook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5145)|
| 1:25:50| Mr. Reynolds ignored specific criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5150)|
| 1:25:53| He was even aided and misled by Gentry Griffey by false statements they made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5153)|
| 1:25:59| that their equipment would be used solely for Gentry Griffey clients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5159)|
| 1:26:03| and no embalmed bodies would be cremated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5163)|
| 1:26:06| a direct contradiction of what the applicant told the newspaper in public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5166)|
| 1:26:10| that some people are embalmed and then cremated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5170)|
| 1:26:13| It was reported that Gentry Griffey's funeral business is in decline with 70 funerals last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5173)|
| 1:26:19| and they are adding the crematory to increase business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5179)|
| 1:26:22| The funeral home reported they intend to market their cremation service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5182)|
| 1:26:27| to funeral homes in other counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5187)|
| 1:26:29| The Crematory Association of North America predicts that in 2016,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5189)|
| 1:26:34| burial and cremation rates will be equal, 50-50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5194)|
| 1:26:39| The determination of accessory use in an O-1 zone was arbitrary and capricious,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5199)|
| 1:26:44| based also on, but not limited to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5204)|
| 1:26:47| Rossanne Services, a former pet crematory at 601 Van Street that was in an I-4 industrial zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5207)|
| 1:26:54| Rowe's Funeral Home inquired about adding a human crematory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5214)|
| 1:26:58| The city said it must be located in an I-4 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5218)|
| 1:27:03| In 1993, the MPC unanimously approved a use-on review for Berry Funeral Home for a pet crematory in an I-4 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5223)|
| 1:27:12| The MPC staff report said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5232)|
| 1:27:15| Dr. Scott, you have one minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5235)|
| 1:27:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5237)|
| 1:27:18| I'll ask that the time be extended when we get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5238)|
| 1:27:20| I'll do my best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5240)|
| 1:27:22| This request may be considered under the provisions of the I-4 district regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5242)|
| 1:27:28| I-4 is the only zoning classification in the Knoxville Zoning Ordinance which would permit the proposed use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5248)|
| 1:27:37| A letter to Mr. Berry from Charles Cummins, chief building official, said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5257)|
| 1:27:41| you ask what is the correct zoning district for this use in Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5261)|
| 1:27:45| A review was conducted by the MPC, the city law department, and codes inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5265)|
| 1:27:50| The official decision is that the correct zoning district for a pet crematory would be I-4 and as a use-on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5270)|
| 1:27:58| A letter from MPC director Norm Whitaker states,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5278)|
| 1:28:02| I-4 is the only zoning district in the city in which the proposed use may be located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5282)|
| 1:28:10| The ordinance states that emissions of odors which can be smelled beyond the property line of the site would constitute a zoning violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5290)|
| 1:28:19| Dr. Scott, your time is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5299)|
| 1:28:21| I will ask that we suspend the rules and give her additional time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5301)|
| 1:28:23| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5303)|
| 1:28:24| Without objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5304)|
| 1:28:26| I'll speak as quickly as I can, and I'll try not to say anything that I don't think is vitally important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5306)|
| 1:28:32| Please do not leave out matter that you intend to cover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5312)|
| 1:28:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5315)|
| 1:28:36| Just to be fair, we should probably put it to a time certain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5316)|
| 1:28:40| That way we give the other side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5320)|
| 1:28:42| It's not going to take an hour or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5322)|
| 1:28:44| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5324)|
| 1:28:45| We're not going to give you an hour either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5325)|
| 1:28:46| I'm keeping track of how much time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5326)|
| 1:28:48| We should probably give a time certain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5328)|
| 1:28:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5330)|
| 1:28:51| How about three minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5331)|
| 1:28:52| Try to wrap it up in three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5332)|
| 1:28:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5333)|
| 1:28:54| That won't be any problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5334)|
| 1:28:55| I've just got half a page here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5335)|
| 1:28:58| What has changed since Barry's had a use-on review for an incinerator in I-4| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5338)|
| 1:29:03| and Rossanne Services was located in I-4| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5343)|
| 1:29:06| and the Rose Funeral Home inquiry that resulted in them being told they had to only have a human crematory in I-4?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5346)|
| 1:29:15| Certainly the zoning ordinance has not changed regarding incinerators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5355)|
| 1:29:21| How is it that in 1993 the chief building inspector, the city law department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5361)|
| 1:29:25| the MPC director and staff, by reviewing the zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5365)|
| 1:29:30| knew exactly where incinerators must be located, I-4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5370)|
| 1:29:35| yet in 2011 the zoning ordinance was misinterpreted or completely ignored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5375)|
| 1:29:43| There was an error, an arbitrary and capricious decision by the building inspector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5383)|
| 1:29:48| We offer other proof of this by citing Article 4, Section 232D,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5388)|
| 1:29:54| Prohibited Uses and Structures in an I-3 Industrial Zone lists incineration as a prohibited use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5394)|
| 1:30:02| Incineration is defined, quote, to consume with fire, to reduce to ashes, to cremate, unquote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5402)|
| 1:30:08| Incineration being specifically mentioned in the zoning ordinance in I-3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5408)|
| 1:30:13| makes it clear a crematory and incinerator would not be permitted even in an I-3 industrial zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5413)|
| 1:30:21| much less in an O-1 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5421)|
| 1:30:25| Article 4, Section 233C1D, uses permitted-on review in an I-4 industrial zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5425)|
| 1:30:33| quote, distillation of bones, unquote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5433)|
| 1:30:36| This language substantiates our claim that cremation shall be an I-4 industrial zone, not O-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5436)|
| 1:30:42| Distillation of bones is defined as feeding the carbonized material into a zone of increased temperature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5442)|
| 1:30:48| to continuously decompose the material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5448)|
| 1:30:51| That definition would have to include cremation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5451)|
| 1:30:55| Gentry Griffey calls his machine a retort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5455)|
| 1:31:01| This is a chemistry term meaning, quote, a closed laboratory vessel with an outlet tube| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5461)|
| 1:31:08| used for distillation or decomposition by heat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5468)|
| 1:31:15| So two citations in our zoning ordinance validate the information we received from Rose General Home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5475)|
| 1:31:22| that the city said a crematory must be located in an I-4 industrial zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5482)|
| 1:31:27| What has changed since that time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5487)|
| 1:31:29| Nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5489)|
| 1:31:31| Article 5, Section 1B, 2, 3, and 4 regarding smoke, odors, and toxic and noxious matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5491)|
| 1:31:38| B-4 says in part, no emission which would be demonstrably injurious to human health, animals, or plant life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5498)|
| 1:31:47| at or beyond lot boundaries of any industrial use in any industrial district will be permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5507)|
| 1:31:53| Yet the determination by a building inspector of a crematory in an O-1 zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5513)|
| 1:31:58| would permit noxious emissions, smoke, and odors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5518)|
| 1:32:03| There is substantial literature to validate that there are noxious, toxic emissions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5523)|
| 1:32:09| and even mercury coming from crematoriums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5529)|
| 1:32:12| In November 2011, NSAFE evaluated published literature emissions from crematoriums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5532)|
| 1:32:19| The conclusion from their report states that the impact from mercury vapor from crematoriums| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5539)|
| 1:32:24| is described as cumulative, worsening as exposure continues over time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5544)|
| 1:32:29| and that mercury can reach levels considered hazardous to human health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5549)|
| 1:32:36| Gentry Griffey's equipment monitors only particulate emissions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5556)|
| 1:32:41| Mercury is not monitored by anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5561)|
| 1:32:45| We have cited evidence in the zoning ordinance that proves...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5565)|
| 1:32:50| Dr. Scott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5570)|
| 1:32:51| This is it. This is my last sentence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5571)|
| 1:32:54| We have cited evidence in the zoning ordinance that proves this administrative decision was arbitrary and capricious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5574)|
| 1:33:00| We respectfully ask for your vote to rescind this determination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5580)|
| 1:33:04| Thank you for my additional time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5584)|
| 1:33:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5586)|
| 1:33:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5588)|
| 1:33:23| My name is Catherine Freels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5603)|
| 1:33:25| I live at 5426 Gaineswood Road in Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5605)|
| 1:33:30| I want to thank the council members and the mayor for this opportunity to present our viewpoints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5610)|
| 1:33:35| on placing this crematory in the middle of Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5615)|
| 1:33:39| We have two arguments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5619)|
| 1:33:41| One is that the city did not conduct a proper review and documentation of its decision to allow the crematory in an O1 zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5621)|
| 1:33:50| and or, number two, the review that the city purports that it made is seriously flawed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5630)|
| 1:33:57| and does not support the city's determination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5637)|
| 1:34:00| Under either argument, the city's action or inaction resulted in an arbitrary and capricious decision unsupported by the evidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5640)|
| 1:34:10| Argument one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5650)|
| 1:34:12| After the Hall Shopper article on October 7th, 2011, which was our first notification that a crematory was included| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5652)|
| 1:34:20| in the addition to Gentry Griffey Funeral Home, that article stated, among other things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5660)|
| 1:34:25| that it was a crematory and that cremation services were to be marketed to surrounding counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5665)|
| 1:34:31| Concerned Fountain Cityans organized the Community Action Network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5671)|
| 1:34:36| After that, several members of this network tried to find out what the city's reasoning was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5676)|
| 1:34:42| for approving the crematory in an O1 office zone and asked the city building inspector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5682)|
| 1:34:47| on separate occasions in October and November 2011, for the written documentation approving the accessory use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5687)|
| 1:34:54| All were told that there were no records because records were not required to be kept when a request was approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5694)|
| 1:35:01| although records were required to be kept when a request was denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5701)|
| 1:35:07| We were also told that a Mr. Gary Norman, a former city building inspector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5707)|
| 1:35:14| had made the decision about the accessory use before he left city service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5714)|
| 1:35:19| and that no further review or requests for information were made before the building permit was approved in August 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5719)|
| 1:35:26| An unresearched, undocumented decision of one city official, therefore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5726)|
| 1:35:31| is the basis for the city's determination that a crematory can be an accessory use for a funeral home in an O1 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5731)|
| 1:35:39| As Dr. Scott has testified, even for a pet crematorium, the city made a detailed multi-office inquiry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5739)|
| 1:35:46| including the law department and MPC, before making a zoning determination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5746)|
| 1:35:53| And pets don't even have mercury in their teeth, so mercury is not being vaporized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5753)|
| 1:36:01| But the city did not conduct such review for a human crematory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5761)|
| 1:36:06| Argument two. Over two months after our network member's request for decision documents and records, which produced nothing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5766)|
| 1:36:13| the city provided a two-page document of its decision-making process at the BZA appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5773)|
| 1:36:19| A review of this document is useful to show that the city's process, even if it had gone through this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5779)|
| 1:36:25| was seriously flawed and does not support placing a crematory as an accessory use in an O1 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5785)|
| 1:36:32| This document includes two oral statements that Gentry Griffey's representative supposedly made to a city official,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5792)|
| 1:36:39| that the purpose of the building addition was to house cremation equipment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5799)|
| 1:36:44| and that the equipment would be operated by Gentry Griffey employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5804)|
| 1:36:48| and used solely for families who are using Gentry Griffey for funeral services and who choose cremation over embalming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5808)|
| 1:36:56| The second part of this statement has been shown to be untrue, as Dr. Scott explained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5816)|
| 1:37:02| As the city's submission to the BZA states, its determination, in quotes, was based on the following steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5822)|
| 1:37:09| Determination that Gentry Griffey's property is zoned O1 office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5829)|
| 1:37:14| and under city zoning ordinance article four, a funeral home is a permitted use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5834)|
| 1:37:19| Ms. Farrell, you have one more minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5839)|
| 1:37:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5841)|
| 1:37:22| I may ask for two additional minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5842)|
| 1:37:26| Proceed, and when we get there, we'll give them to you, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5846)|
| 1:37:29| A review of the zoning ordinance definitions for undertaking establishment and or funeral home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5849)|
| 1:37:36| the city stated that it looked for definitions in article two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5856)|
| 1:37:40| and because article two does not define undertaking establishment or funeral home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5860)|
| 1:37:44| the city says it checked Webster's dictionary definition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5864)|
| 1:37:48| and it states that a funeral home is an establishment with facilities for the preparation of the dead for burial or cremation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5868)|
| 1:37:54| Note that it does not include actual cremation in that definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5874)|
| 1:37:58| The Webster definition for undertaker is one whose business is to prepare the dead for burial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5878)|
| 1:38:03| and to arrange and manage funerals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5883)|
| 1:38:05| Note that it states prepare the dead for burial, not cremation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5885)|
| 1:38:09| The city then determined that a standalone crematory solely for cremations would not be a permitted use in zone O1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5889)|
| 1:38:17| The city then said it reviewed article five, section four, accessory uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5897)|
| 1:38:21| Ms. Freels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5901)|
| 1:38:22| I will move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5902)|
| 1:38:23| The time is up now at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5903)|
| 1:38:24| The time is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5904)|
| 1:38:25| I will move that we give her three additional minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5905)|
| 1:38:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5908)|
| 1:38:29| I don't think I'll get that much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5909)|
| 1:38:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5910)|
| 1:38:31| If there's no objection, we'll grant three additional minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5911)|
| 1:38:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5913)|
| 1:38:36| The entire analysis and rationale for the city's determination is in these three sentences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5916)|
| 1:38:41| according to the city's submission to the BZA appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5921)|
| 1:38:46| The existing funeral home is a permitted use in the O1 zoning district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5926)|
| 1:38:50| Existing funeral home is two-story with approximately 8,644 total square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5930)|
| 1:38:56| Proposed addition is one-story attached structure with 1,154 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5936)|
| 1:39:03| The four requirements to be analyzed for a proposed accessory use include that it's customarily incidental to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5943)|
| 1:39:09| principal use established on the same lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5949)|
| 1:39:12| As Dr. Scott has testified, there is no crematory or funeral home in Knoxville that does cremation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5952)|
| 1:39:21| This is not a customary use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5961)|
| 1:39:24| It shall be subordinate to and serve such principal use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5964)|
| 1:39:29| Our zoning ordinances do not allow crematories outside I-4 zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5969)|
| 1:39:34| and there is no analysis about how this crematory would be subordinate to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5974)|
| 1:39:41| and serve such principal use of the funeral home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5981)|
| 1:39:44| In fact, the evidence is that very quickly this crematory could be the principal use for the funeral home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5984)|
| 1:39:50| It shall be subordinate in area, extent, and purpose to such principal use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5990)|
| 1:39:57| And the same argument applies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5997)|
| 1:39:58| There was no analysis whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=5998)|
| 1:40:03| There is also no analysis of the crematory's contribution to the comfort, convenience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6003)|
| 1:40:06| or necessity of Gentry Griffey, and the city has no supportable basis for its determination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6006)|
| 1:40:15| A decision without evidentiary support is an arbitrary one, according to the state court of appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6015)|
| 1:40:27| Therefore, we are under both of our arguments, or either of our arguments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6027)|
| 1:40:33| we ask that the city rescind this permit and grant our appeal because of the lack of review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6033)|
| 1:40:42| and evidence or documentation to support the city's determination to allow a crematory in an O-1 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6042)|
| 1:40:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6050)|
| 1:40:51| Thank you, Ms. Frills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6051)|
| 1:41:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6060)|
| 1:41:01| So the speakers opposed to this appeal are Mr. Arthur Seymour, Jr., Mr. Rich Ray, and Eric Botts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6061)|
| 1:41:12| Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6072)|
| 1:41:14| I mean, this is a little unusual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6074)|
| 1:41:21| What's unusual about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6081)|
| 1:41:22| Well, let me start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6082)|
| 1:41:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6085)|
| 1:41:26| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6086)|
| 1:41:27| Name and address, and let me get my timer going here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6087)|
| 1:41:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6089)|
| 1:41:30| Although that doesn't seem to be important tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6090)|
| 1:41:33| But it's a fine timer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6093)|
| 1:41:34| It's a really fine one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6094)|
| 1:41:36| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6096)|
| 1:41:37| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6097)|
| 1:41:38| Mayor, members of council, I'm Arthur Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6098)|
| 1:41:40| My office address is 550 West Main Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6100)|
| 1:41:46| I am here on behalf of the Appalee, which is the Gentry Griffey Funeral Home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6106)|
| 1:41:51| and in support of the issuance of the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6111)|
| 1:41:55| And there are several permits that have been issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6115)|
| 1:41:59| I might explain at the outset that your job, and you can ask your council or Mr. Swanson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6119)|
| 1:42:09| is a little different than in the normal legislative process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6129)|
| 1:42:12| You all are here reviewing the issuance of a building permit by the city of Knoxville, Mr. Reynolds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6132)|
| 1:42:21| issuance of the building permit, or Mr. Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6141)|
| 1:42:24| But, anyway, it was the Department of the City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6144)|
| 1:42:26| That matter was appealed to the city of Knoxville's Board of Zoning Appeals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6146)|
| 1:42:32| which heard the matter last month and unanimously turned down the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6152)|
| 1:42:38| And the matter was appealed here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6158)|
| 1:42:40| And you all, respectfully, are not acting as legislators here, where your discretion is pretty wide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6160)|
| 1:42:52| but are sitting in judgment of whether or not this building permit was properly issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6172)|
| 1:43:00| If I may, let me introduce Mr. Botts as representative of Gentry Griffey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6180)|
| 1:43:08| Jerry Griffey is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6188)|
| 1:43:12| Mr. Williams, an owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6192)|
| 1:43:14| Mr. Ray, an owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6194)|
| 1:43:15| And Jennifer Holder, who is working with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6195)|
| 1:43:18| And they will answer questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6198)|
| 1:43:20| They would like for me to make the main presentation here, if I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6200)|
| 1:43:25| I have submitted to you, and I will submit to Ms. Mitchell as part of the record in a moment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6205)|
| 1:43:31| I have hopefully gotten in each of your hands a memorandum dated February 16 with an exhibit list that consists of the following.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6211)|
| 1:43:43| First are the building plans submitted to the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6223)|
| 1:43:49| The plan is reviewed by the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6229)|
| 1:43:52| The building permit issued by the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6232)|
| 1:43:56| A permit to construct issued by the Knox County Department of Air Quality Management,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6236)|
| 1:44:02| which parenthetically administers the TDEC air regulations in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6242)|
| 1:44:09| Counties can opt in or opt out if Knox County has opted to administer the state's program on air quality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6249)|
| 1:44:18| Attendances, statutes, and cases cited in my memorandum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6258)|
| 1:44:22| A detail of cost incurred to construct and equip the crematory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6262)|
| 1:44:27| A certificate of completion that was issued on February 15, 2012, just this month, by the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6267)|
| 1:44:37| And a certificate of occupancy issued by the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6277)|
| 1:44:43| There are three main issues here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6283)|
| 1:44:46| One, did the city issue a building permit properly for the expansion of the funeral home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6286)|
| 1:44:58| to include an on-site crematorium as an accessory use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6298)|
| 1:45:03| And I submit the answer is yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6303)|
| 1:45:06| And a lengthy discussion is in the BZA minutes presented by Mr. Reynolds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6306)|
| 1:45:11| and that's part of your record here, to the Board of Zoning Appeals explaining that use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6311)|
| 1:45:17| Second, we submit respectfully that a crematory is a permitted use as part of a funeral home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6317)|
| 1:45:27| And we rely in that instance on the case issued by the Tennessee Court of Appeals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6327)|
| 1:45:33| BMC Enterprises, Inc., versus the city of Mount Juliet, which is in the packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6333)|
| 1:45:39| That was decided by the Tennessee Court of Appeals in 2008| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6339)|
| 1:45:44| and is in the official reporter of the cases issued by our appellate courts in the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6344)|
| 1:45:51| and can be cited as authority for the propositions set forth therein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6351)|
| 1:45:57| And third, we respectfully submit that Gentry Griffey has acquired a vested right in the operation of this crematory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6357)|
| 1:46:09| Let me go back to the second issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6369)|
| 1:46:11| Is a crematory a proper accessory use for a funeral home?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6371)|
| 1:46:20| The city of Knoxville, like any municipality or county or political subdivision of the state, has the right to regulate land use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6380)|
| 1:46:30| pursuant to enabling statutes from the state legislature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6390)|
| 1:46:35| And that's Title 13 of the Tennessee Code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6395)|
| 1:46:37| Mr. Seymour, okay, your five minutes is up, and I'm sure we're going to grant you more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6397)|
| 1:46:42| I'm going to ask that we grant him additional three minutes so that he can speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6402)|
| 1:46:45| And if he needs more, we can address that at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6405)|
| 1:46:48| I will be the only speaker on the appellee side, unless there are questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6408)|
| 1:46:54| I can tell you, counsel, we added it up, and the appellants had about 24, close to 25 minutes total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6414)|
| 1:47:04| So extra would have been seven minutes or eight minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6424)|
| 1:47:08| Nine minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6428)|
| 1:47:11| Fifteen, like nine extra minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6431)|
| 1:47:13| Nine extra minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6433)|
| 1:47:14| Ten extra.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6434)|
| 1:47:15| Nine extra minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6435)|
| 1:47:16| Three speakers, five each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6436)|
| 1:47:17| Almost ten extra, well, in total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6437)|
| 1:47:22| I can give you up to additional ten minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6442)|
| 1:47:24| Thank you very much, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6444)|
| 1:47:27| Then we'll see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6447)|
| 1:47:29| As I stated a moment ago, the city of Knoxville's right to regulate land use is granted by the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6449)|
| 1:47:36| And I won't give you my appellate court argument, but basically the city of Knoxville has no sovereignty like the state of Tennessee does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6456)|
| 1:47:46| But it has, under Title 13, the right to regulate, within the parameters set out there, land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6466)|
| 1:47:54| And it does through its zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6474)|
| 1:47:56| But when state law sets forth certain things, you default or go to state law to determine what the proper land use procedure is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6476)|
| 1:48:08| In this case, state law defines an undertaking establishment and or a funeral home as any business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6488)|
| 1:48:17| and I'm not going to read all of this, engaged in arranging, directing, or supervising funerals for profit or other benefit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6497)|
| 1:48:24| the preparing of dead human bodies for burial, the disposition of dead human bodies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6504)|
| 1:48:30| the provision or maintenance of place for the preparation for disposition or for the care or disposition of human bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6510)|
| 1:48:39| The Tennessee Court of Appeals has said that that definition clearly states that funeral homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6519)|
| 1:48:49| and crematories are not viewed as separate industries, but rather as complementary services offered by the funeral industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6529)|
| 1:48:57| And that's what Gentry Griffey proposes to do here and has constructed, in reliance upon this permit, the right to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6537)|
| 1:49:08| The court went on to say both funeral homes and crematories offer services commonly provided by the funeral industry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6548)|
| 1:49:15| and funeral home services and cremations are frequently offered at the same location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6555)|
| 1:49:21| And in that case, approved a crematory as part of a funeral home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6561)|
| 1:49:27| And that is the business of Gentry Griffey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6567)|
| 1:49:32| They are an undertaking establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6572)|
| 1:49:34| They arrange for funerals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6574)|
| 1:49:37| And this is just a part of the additional service that they are arranging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6577)|
| 1:49:43| There has been much discussion about mercury and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6583)|
| 1:49:48| I'm not going into that because I don't think, and I respectfully submit, that's really not part of the discussion tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6588)|
| 1:49:56| That is regulated by the Knox County Department of Air Quality Management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6596)|
| 1:50:01| Gentry Griffey has a construction permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6601)|
| 1:50:04| They will be regulated on their emissions by the permit that will be issued by Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6604)|
| 1:50:14| Now, vested rights, my third issue, is that generally, and this is law throughout the United States,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6614)|
| 1:50:25| that when a business or an individual obtains a valid permit from a governmental entity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6625)|
| 1:50:33| and expends substantial sums pursuant to that permit, whether it be a permit to construct a home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6633)|
| 1:50:41| whether it be a permit to construct, in this case, a crematory or any other type of business, a garage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6641)|
| 1:50:49| and you obtain that permit lawfully, you expend money on it, and substantial money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6649)|
| 1:50:55| And here they've spent their whole budget on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6655)|
| 1:50:58| You have a vested right to operate in that structure or that building or, in this case, the crematory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6658)|
| 1:51:08| And I have cited in my memorandum what state law says about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6668)|
| 1:51:12| and I think you can find words to that effect in every other jurisdiction in the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6672)|
| 1:51:20| What I would like to do is respectfully submit that this appeal should be denied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6680)|
| 1:51:30| but I also suggest to you, and this is a recent development, as I mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6690)|
| 1:51:36| not only has the building permit been issued, they have obtained, Gentry Griffey, a certificate of occupancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6696)|
| 1:51:45| Generally, when you obtain a building permit, you cannot use the building or structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6705)|
| 1:51:54| until it has obtained all its final inspections from the issuing authority, in this case, the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6714)|
| 1:52:01| So they have submitted their plans to the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6721)|
| 1:52:06| Permit was issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6726)|
| 1:52:08| Gentry Griffey built this crematory as an addition to their funeral home in accordance with those plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6728)|
| 1:52:15| The city of Knoxville has come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6735)|
| 1:52:17| They have had an electrical inspection, a plumbing inspection, a heating HVAC inspection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6737)|
| 1:52:25| and then a final inspection and have concurred or issued a permit saying, yes, this structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6745)|
| 1:52:34| this business was erected in strict accordance with plans we approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6754)|
| 1:52:40| and, therefore, the owner can go ahead and occupy and use this crematory in accordance with the certificate of occupancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6760)|
| 1:52:50| So, really, the building permit issue is behind us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6770)|
| 1:52:56| The real issue is, was the certificate of occupancy correctly issued?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6776)|
| 1:53:01| And I submit there is no appeal here before that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6781)|
| 1:53:04| and respectfully submit to you that Gentry Griffey has the right to go ahead and operate their business at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6784)|
| 1:53:15| Finally, back to Issue 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6795)|
| 1:53:17| And I said Issue 1 was, was the permit properly issued by Mr. Reynolds' department as an accessory use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6797)|
| 1:53:25| And we say the answer is yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6805)|
| 1:53:28| And his explanation of that is two pages long, and I won't go into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6808)|
| 1:53:33| He is here prepared to testify as well as Ms. Cash on the process the city went through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6813)|
| 1:53:39| But that is well documented in the testimony before the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6819)|
| 1:53:45| Secondly, I respectfully submit that this is a permitted use in accordance with state law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6825)|
| 1:53:54| and the opinion, recent opinion, of our Court of Appeals in BMC Enterprises v. City of Mount Juliet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6834)|
| 1:54:02| And thirdly and finally, Gentry Griffey has obtained a vested right, as any other citizen would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6842)|
| 1:54:11| who goes and lawfully obtains a permit from the City of Knoxville, which is issued,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6851)|
| 1:54:16| builds his project in conformance with the building plans that he has submitted for review and have been approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6856)|
| 1:54:24| and then has survived all the final inspections and received a Certificate of Completion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6864)|
| 1:54:30| and a Certificate of Occupancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6870)|
| 1:54:33| And I respectfully, on behalf of Gentry Griffey, ask that you all deny this appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6873)|
| 1:54:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6880)|
| 1:54:41| Thank you, Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6881)|
| 1:54:43| And then I will submit to Ms. Mitchell our written submittal, which confirms this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6883)|
| 1:54:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6893)|
| 1:54:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6894)|
| 1:54:55| And that's all for your side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6895)|
| 1:54:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6898)|
| 1:54:59| Now the appellants get a two-minute time for rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6899)|
| 1:55:08| I might ask, have they submitted their document to Ms. Mitchell as an exhibit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6908)|
| 1:55:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6912)|
| 1:55:13| Yes, they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6913)|
| 1:55:14| Ms. Ferrell, you have up to two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6914)|
| 1:55:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6916)|
| 1:55:19| Regarding the proper building permit, I think I adequately covered that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6919)|
| 1:55:23| and I think a look at the two-page document that Mr. Reynolds submitted at the BZA hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6923)|
| 1:55:32| was a document that was prepared for the BZA hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6932)|
| 1:55:35| And even at that, it was not an adequate review if that had been conducted at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6935)|
| 1:55:41| Number two, Gentry Griffey's cremation services have been approved by the city at this point as an accessory use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6941)|
| 1:55:50| What happens after it doesn't become an accessory use and becomes the main use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6950)|
| 1:55:55| That's a very big concern for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6955)|
| 1:55:59| Number three, vested rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6959)|
| 1:56:00| I do want to touch on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6960)|
| 1:56:03| Gentry Griffey, if it's received a certificate of occupancy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6963)|
| 1:56:08| has done so at the same time as this appeal has been underway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6968)|
| 1:56:12| And since about November, the middle of November or so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6972)|
| 1:56:15| Gentry Griffey has known that our organization was going to appeal its permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6975)|
| 1:56:20| It has expended probably at least half of its funds since that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6980)|
| 1:56:26| And I want to make sure that you know that they, instead of buying a state-of-the-art retort or incinerator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6986)|
| 1:56:33| they bought a used one when they told us they were doing state-of-the-art top of the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6993)|
| 1:56:38| This is a used one, and the cost of it is approximately $36,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=6998)|
| 1:56:42| In addition, their building plans included, according to what we can tell from the plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7002)|
| 1:56:48| at least two handicapped bathrooms, a kitchen, a viewing area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7008)|
| 1:56:53| and other improvements that have nothing to do with the crematory itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7013)|
| 1:56:57| You have 20 seconds, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7017)|
| 1:56:59| We still urge the city, because of future funeral homes that will want crematories like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7019)|
| 1:57:04| to rescind this permit and grant our appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7024)|
| 1:57:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7028)|
| 1:57:09| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7029)|
| 1:57:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7030)|
| 1:57:11| We have now come to the time for counsel to deliberate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7031)|
| 1:57:15| and to ask any questions they might have of either of the sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7035)|
| 1:57:19| Councilman Della Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7039)|
| 1:57:20| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7040)|
| 1:57:24| This matter has been troubling this entire fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7044)|
| 1:57:28| It's really been one that has interesting points on both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7048)|
| 1:57:34| There has been a lot of community concern and vocal outcry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7054)|
| 1:57:40| You will recall back in November after there was a meeting at the Fountain City Town Hall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7060)|
| 1:57:46| which I had occasion to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7066)|
| 1:57:48| There was about 100 people present at that meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7068)|
| 1:57:50| including the Gentry Griffey folks and the State Air Board people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7070)|
| 1:57:54| I came here and introduced a resolution that we ask MPC to be studying cremation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7074)|
| 1:58:02| and crematories in the future for our zoning code, because regardless of what happens here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7082)|
| 1:58:08| it's important that we have a clear path to follow in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7088)|
| 1:58:13| This case illustrates sort of the horror that has gone on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7093)|
| 1:58:19| The worst part to me is that somehow this decision was made casually in a phone conversation or a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7099)|
| 1:58:28| No documents were written at the time, no public notice, no consultation of MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7108)|
| 1:58:34| no resolution of the disparity between the Norman Whitaker MPC analysis of 1993| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7114)|
| 1:58:42| that had the benefit of input from the legal department and the building official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7122)|
| 1:58:48| It's really troublesome how this arose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7128)|
| 1:58:50| This was the first crematory issue to hit the floor, so to speak, in 20 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7130)|
| 1:58:57| and it was handled like a routine matter with no consultation outside of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7137)|
| 1:59:04| Mr. Norman has been the person that has been identified as someone that the Gentry Griffey folks talked to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7144)|
| 1:59:11| to get the permit, and I give them credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7151)|
| 1:59:13| They had their architect, Andrew Powers, apparently talk to him and to the building officials about their plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7153)|
| 1:59:21| and what they wanted to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7161)|
| 1:59:23| Mr. Norman is said to have said it could be used as an accessory reuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7163)|
| 1:59:28| Well, I called him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7168)|
| 1:59:29| He's down in Louisiana.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7169)|
| 1:59:30| He retired from here to take care of his folks down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7170)|
| 1:59:33| They were ill and getting older, and I asked him if he had made any documentation, and he said no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7173)|
| 1:59:39| He said in the course of his job, he has asked a lot of questions casually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7179)|
| 1:59:44| and he gives opinions off the cuff sometimes, but there was no formal submission to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7184)|
| 1:59:51| There were no drawings given to him that he was asked to review and say is this an accessory use or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7191)|
| 1:59:56| and he said it's sort of easy to blame the guy that isn't there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7196)|
| 1:59:59| I left mid-February 2011, and I was not involved in the review of these plans that are part of the permit process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7199)|
| 2:00:07| So that takes us down to Mr. Reynolds' department and Tom Reynolds, who was the building official after Gary left,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7207)|
| 2:00:14| and it's troublesome to me because Mr. Reynolds' comments to the community group in November were, gosh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7214)|
| 2:00:22| I didn't make this decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7222)|
| 2:00:24| My boss did, Gary, but if it was up to me, I would have denied it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7224)|
| 2:00:29| and then had them go to the BZA and see if they could get the permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7229)|
| 2:00:33| but I would have not issued it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7233)|
| 2:00:35| At the BZA hearing in January, he had a different approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7235)|
| 2:00:40| He followed the scenario that Mr. Seymour ably presented, and that was that at that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7240)|
| 2:00:49| the analysis was what's an accessory use, what do the cases say, and this is an accessory use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7249)|
| 2:00:55| and that's what I'm relying on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7255)|
| 2:00:57| At the time that he was asked back in November, there was nothing in the file.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7257)|
| 2:01:01| His boss told him that was his decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7261)|
| 2:01:03| He was aware of it, but he did not, and he didn't make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7263)|
| 2:01:06| That's odd because on August the 23rd, 2011, he was confronted with issuing the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7266)|
| 2:01:14| He's the building official that issued the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7274)|
| 2:01:17| So in effect, he decided that it was permissible as an accessory use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7277)|
| 2:01:21| You have to say that whether he confronted it or thought he was bound by it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7281)|
| 2:01:25| he's the one that made the decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7285)|
| 2:01:28| And three months later, he still didn't know if he agreed with that or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7288)|
| 2:01:32| and he was troubled by the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7292)|
| 2:01:34| So I've been troubled just trying to sit here as both the city council person for this district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7294)|
| 2:01:39| as well as a citizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7299)|
| 2:01:41| I mean, we have a neighborhood here, and this is the part that troubles me the most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7301)|
| 2:01:44| We have a neighborhood here that has an office use, an O1 use for a chapel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7304)|
| 2:01:50| It's a funeral chapel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7310)|
| 2:01:52| That's what it's called, and you know what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7312)|
| 2:01:55| Someone dies, and the body is prepared, whether by cremation or by embalming or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7315)|
| 2:02:01| and families get together, and the chapels are places where we come to grieve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7321)|
| 2:02:05| and to share our love and condolences for friends and family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7325)|
| 2:02:09| And that's the use that our zoning code says is perfectly acceptable in O1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7329)|
| 2:02:15| Now the question comes, is cremation an accessory use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7335)|
| 2:02:20| We've heard Mr. Seymour argue ably that if I look at definitions of a funeral director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7340)|
| 2:02:26| and an undertaking authority that's regulated by the State Department of Funeral Directors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7346)|
| 2:02:33| or whatever exactly it's called, I'm not sure that's the right title,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7353)|
| 2:02:36| that business is broad enough to include cremation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7356)|
| 2:02:39| and anyone who lives in Knoxville and looks in the obituary pages or watches TV| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7359)|
| 2:02:45| will see that almost every one of our funeral homes say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7365)|
| 2:02:49| we'll offer you a traditional funeral, cremation, whatever you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7369)|
| 2:02:52| We're there to serve your family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7372)|
| 2:02:54| That idea that you can get that service clearly is done by funeral homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7374)|
| 2:02:59| but what isn't said in those commercials nor in Mr. Seymour's presentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7379)|
| 2:03:05| is that the customary practice, the only practice going on in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7385)|
| 2:03:10| is that they take these bodies by hearse, by truck, by some other means,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7390)|
| 2:03:14| to a crematory that's licensed in an industrial park out in Rockford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7394)|
| 2:03:19| It's right near, it's Maryville or it's Rockford, it's Blount County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7399)|
| 2:03:22| either way you want to call it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7402)|
| 2:03:24| And that facility does nothing but receive bodies, they're put in a refrigerator unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7404)|
| 2:03:30| and I happen to have gone out there and spent two hours to enjoy the activity of a crematory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7410)|
| 2:03:36| so I would have some sense of what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7416)|
| 2:03:38| But they're put in a cooler while they await their turn to go into this furnace, retort, incinerator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7418)|
| 2:03:45| call it what you will, the device that's designed to consume the bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7425)|
| 2:03:49| The bodies arrive in cardboard boxes, sometimes zipped in plastic if it's a disaster,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7429)|
| 2:03:55| they might have shoes on and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7435)|
| 2:03:57| They do not touch the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7437)|
| 2:03:59| The body is something they receive, put in this unit, burn it at 1,600 plus degrees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7439)|
| 2:04:05| and then take the ashes out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7445)|
| 2:04:07| They grind up the bones separately and put them in the pile of ashes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7447)|
| 2:04:12| And the family then receives the ashes of their loved one to put in an urn or keep on the shelf| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7452)|
| 2:04:17| or dispose wherever was that person's favorite place as part of a ceremony of love and departure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7457)|
| 2:04:23| and, you know, saying goodbye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7463)|
| 2:04:25| But the practice, the customary practice, and I'll turn you, as they did, to the zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7465)|
| 2:04:32| The four things that Mr. Reynolds was charged with looking at or his predecessor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7472)|
| 2:04:38| if you want to tag him as the guy, is in Article V, and it's Section 4, and it's accessory use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7478)|
| 2:04:47| And it has to be customarily incidental to the principal use established on the same lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7487)|
| 2:04:53| Now, on the same lot in Knoxville, we probably have 20 funeral homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7493)|
| 2:04:57| There ain't no people cremating bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7497)|
| 2:05:00| And the concern of that neighborhood is, look, this is by the lake where our kids recreate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7500)|
| 2:05:06| and play, where they fish in the water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7506)|
| 2:05:08| It's by the daycare center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7508)|
| 2:05:10| It's by the residences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7510)|
| 2:05:12| And we're now putting a smokestack industry in the midst of what's an office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7512)|
| 2:05:17| and residential mixed-use area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7517)|
| 2:05:19| That's not right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7519)|
| 2:05:21| That's their complaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7521)|
| 2:05:22| And, frankly, I think that's an awfully important complaint, that what are you doing to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7522)|
| 2:05:27| This is a neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7527)|
| 2:05:28| Zones protect like uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7528)|
| 2:05:30| And we have to confront the legal question that's ably raised by Mr. Seymour, which is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7530)|
| 2:05:36| can you somehow analyze abstractly, as apparently the court in BMC literally did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7536)|
| 2:05:43| that if you take this profession, it includes cremation, and, therefore, someone gets a land-use right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7543)|
| 2:05:52| which to me is a different question altogether.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7552)|
| 2:05:55| And that is, where is it appropriate to do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7555)|
| 2:05:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7559)|
| 2:06:00| And I don't know that the court grappled with that real question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7560)|
| 2:06:03| And that's the question that's before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7563)|
| 2:06:05| We had a building official who got by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7565)|
| 2:06:08| It's customarily incidental to the principal use on the same lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7568)|
| 2:06:13| that is the lot that has the chapel business that's been there for 80 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7573)|
| 2:06:17| to subordinate to and serve the principal use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7577)|
| 2:06:21| Well, I suppose you could say that the idea of cremation and having a body cremated is subordinate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7581)|
| 2:06:27| but they raised the question, the neighborhood group raises the significant question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7587)|
| 2:06:32| if there are more bodies being cremated than there were the traditional principal use of that place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7592)|
| 2:06:39| which was funerals, 70, maybe 100 a year, what is the principal use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7599)|
| 2:06:45| And if they're asking, and you have the permit in the file that Mr. Seymour filed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7605)|
| 2:06:51| their permit includes an application that they hand wrote out that said they're going to run it 16 hours a day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7611)|
| 2:06:58| seven days a week, 365 days a year, and I guess someone has done the math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7618)|
| 2:07:05| If you multiply all that out and you divide cremations by three or four hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7625)|
| 2:07:09| you get a number like 1,400 cremations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7629)|
| 2:07:13| I mean, here's a place that's doing 100 funerals, and now they're going to do 1,400 cremations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7633)|
| 2:07:18| and they are advertising in other counties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7638)|
| 2:07:21| and they are soliciting Knoxville funeral homes to send them their bodies so they can cremate them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7641)|
| 2:07:27| Is that subordinate to the principal use on this lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7647)|
| 2:07:32| or is this an attempt to run a cremation facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7652)|
| 2:07:38| which even our own people say is an I-4 activity if it's a freestanding in the guise of an accessory use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7658)|
| 2:07:43| I mean, that's an important concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7663)|
| 2:07:46| I want you to keep that in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7666)|
| 2:07:48| And the Item 4 in the accessory use under Section 4 of Article 5 says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7668)|
| 2:07:52| contributes to the comfort, convenience, or necessity of users of the principal use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7672)|
| 2:07:57| I submit to you that the users of the principal use are the families that come there to have the funerals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7677)|
| 2:08:04| And, you know, they make the argument, and it's probably a good one in this sense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7684)|
| 2:08:11| they being Gentry Griffey, that more people want cremation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7691)|
| 2:08:16| It's cheaper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7696)|
| 2:08:18| Give them that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7698)|
| 2:08:19| They dispose of the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7699)|
| 2:08:20| We're not taking up land in scarce, you know, cemeteries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7700)|
| 2:08:25| They make that argument, but if you start bringing in outside business from other funeral homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7705)|
| 2:08:31| from other counties, from other places in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7711)|
| 2:08:34| are you contributing to the comfort, convenience, and necessity of users of the principal use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7714)|
| 2:08:40| or are you conducting a business-for-hire cremation that is unrelated to the users of that funeral home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7720)|
| 2:08:48| where people come to send their people goodbye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7728)|
| 2:08:51| So I think there's a nice question here, and we can look at case law all the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7731)|
| 2:08:55| We can listen to neighborhoods all the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7735)|
| 2:08:57| There's a nice question of did our building officials do this right, or did they screw it up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7737)|
| 2:09:03| I mean, just in plain terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7743)|
| 2:09:04| And it seems to me that they ignored the precedence that went to the proposition that Rose was asked for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7744)|
| 2:09:12| and was told, no, you can't have one, go to I-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7752)|
| 2:09:16| They ignore what Norman Whitaker was talking about in 1993 when they told that party with the Pet Cemetery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7756)|
| 2:09:22| that's in the materials that that's the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7762)|
| 2:09:25| And we're here in a situation where the permit seems to have jumped the gun| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7765)|
| 2:09:31| and relied on bad information in part from gentry periphery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7771)|
| 2:09:35| And why is that important?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7775)|
| 2:09:36| The last argument that Mr. Seymour makes is that there's a vested right to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7776)|
| 2:09:42| I got my permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7782)|
| 2:09:43| I spent money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7783)|
| 2:09:44| I got a vested right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7784)|
| 2:09:45| Leave me alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7785)|
| 2:09:47| And the case law clearly says spending money in reliance in good faith on the permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7787)|
| 2:09:55| and reliance in good faith includes, I think, whether they submitted fair information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7795)|
| 2:10:01| that this was an accessory use or whether they sort of dumbed it down to, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7801)|
| 2:10:05| we're just kind of helping our customers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7805)|
| 2:10:07| Because Mr. Reynolds, God bless him, when he spoke before the BZA and had his little script that he read| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7807)|
| 2:10:12| with the help of his lawyer, Angela Rauber, he clearly said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7812)|
| 2:10:16| this is only going to be for customers of the gentry periphery funeral home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7816)|
| 2:10:20| that need that convenience of a cremation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7820)|
| 2:10:23| And that ain't what they're trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7823)|
| 2:10:25| So if they helped get the permit under sort of misleading or certainly cloudy information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7825)|
| 2:10:33| I don't think they can rely on the permit to put it up as a shield and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7833)|
| 2:10:37| see, I spent my money on a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7837)|
| 2:10:39| The other thing I'll suggest to you and I'll shut up is the tab number six,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7839)|
| 2:10:46| which Mr. Seymour mentioned, is worthy of looking at because when you look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7846)|
| 2:10:52| you find out that they spent about $16,000 or $17,000 on their architect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7852)|
| 2:10:58| and paid him by July, which was at least a month before the permit was issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7858)|
| 2:11:03| So that money was spent beforehand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7863)|
| 2:11:06| And they spent another $15,000 trucking the retort or crematory machine to this facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7866)|
| 2:11:18| And that was done in August 11th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7878)|
| 2:11:20| They were paid for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7880)|
| 2:11:21| So that was before the permit was issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7881)|
| 2:11:23| And they paid the bill for the retort on October 11th, the $36,799.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7883)|
| 2:11:29| But, heck, if it was being shipped to them, it was theirs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7889)|
| 2:11:33| and they bought it before the permit was issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7893)|
| 2:11:35| They simply paid the bill later like some of us do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7895)|
| 2:11:38| You wait 30 days or 60 days or whatever until it's there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7898)|
| 2:11:41| and you check it out before you pay the bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7901)|
| 2:11:43| So substantial money was spent before the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7903)|
| 2:11:47| They did spend money after the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7907)|
| 2:11:49| There's no denying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7909)|
| 2:11:50| There's no denying that based on this record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7910)|
| 2:11:53| I asked the neighborhood, why did you wait so long?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7913)|
| 2:11:56| And they said they didn't even know there was a crematory being built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7916)|
| 2:11:58| The city of Knoxville gave no notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7918)|
| 2:12:00| It's a computer system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7920)|
| 2:12:02| If you went down to the building office, it said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7922)|
| 2:12:04| addition to Gentry Griffey Building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7924)|
| 2:12:07| It didn't say to build a crematory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7927)|
| 2:12:09| So you couldn't get it if you went and looked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7929)|
| 2:12:11| There's nothing published in the paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7931)|
| 2:12:13| No one sent a notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7933)|
| 2:12:14| No one goes to MPC and says send out the card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7934)|
| 2:12:17| So they said by the time we found out about it from the newspaper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7937)|
| 2:12:20| we held a meeting in November and we asked Mr. Reynolds specifically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7940)|
| 2:12:24| can we appeal now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7944)|
| 2:12:26| And he took about a week or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7946)|
| 2:12:27| He got back with the legal department and he said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7947)|
| 2:12:29| yes, I've checked with the legal department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7949)|
| 2:12:31| You can appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7951)|
| 2:12:32| They filed their appeal on December the 19th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7952)|
| 2:12:34| You can check the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7954)|
| 2:12:35| But it's something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7955)|
| 2:12:36| So they acted not as promptly as I'd like to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7956)|
| 2:12:41| That troubles me a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7961)|
| 2:12:42| I'd like to see this issue before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7962)|
| 2:12:44| The day the permit's issued, we're sitting here saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7964)|
| 2:12:47| did he screw up or not, and it's theoretical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7967)|
| 2:12:49| But we're in a messy situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7969)|
| 2:12:51| We've got a guy that built a building partly for bathrooms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7971)|
| 2:12:54| partly for a viewing room, but partly for this device that he's going to burn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7974)|
| 2:12:59| stuff in, and he spent $60,000, $70,000 buying it and shipping it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7979)|
| 2:13:04| and more money probably bolting it to the floor and hooking up wires| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7984)|
| 2:13:07| and stuff to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7987)|
| 2:13:08| He spent money after the permit was issued, you'd have to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7988)|
| 2:13:11| at least getting his building done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7991)|
| 2:13:14| So it's a messy, messy problem before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7994)|
| 2:13:17| But the question I ask you to think about as you decide how you're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=7997)|
| 2:13:21| vote is, was this community treated fairly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8001)|
| 2:13:26| Did our building official give them any kind of notice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8006)|
| 2:13:29| Did our building official and the whole department over there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8009)|
| 2:13:32| even look back to the history of what did Knoxville do in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8012)|
| 2:13:36| and decide what's a proper zone for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8016)|
| 2:13:39| And did they incorrectly look at facts, use wrong facts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8019)|
| 2:13:45| on finding out that this was an accessory use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8025)|
| 2:13:48| If you find that they did, I think we have to say the permit was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8028)|
| 2:13:51| invalidly issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8031)|
| 2:13:52| And maybe there's some other remedy or workout that happens after that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8032)|
| 2:13:55| but the question in front of us right now is, did they screw up giving this permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8035)|
| 2:14:00| And hearing some of the proof, I tend to believe that they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8040)|
| 2:14:05| So I'll leave that with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8045)|
| 2:14:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8047)|
| 2:14:08| Councilman Graves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8048)|
| 2:14:09| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8049)|
| 2:14:10| I didn't go to the BCA meeting, but I have read the reports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8050)|
| 2:14:13| and have read all the reports and files and papers that have been sent to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8053)|
| 2:14:16| But, Madam Mayor, if it's appropriate, I'd like to hear from the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8056)|
| 2:14:20| I'd like to hear from the building officials in terms of what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8060)|
| 2:14:23| We've heard people's analysis from both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8063)|
| 2:14:28| But if it's appropriate, I'd like to hear from the city building folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8068)|
| 2:14:35| Christy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8075)|
| 2:14:36| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8076)|
| 2:14:37| First, I probably should comment on my review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8077)|
| 2:14:39| Obviously, I was not directly involved in this decision-making process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8079)|
| 2:14:42| I did review the decision that was made by zoning and the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8082)|
| 2:14:46| Let me, just for the purposes, this is Christy Branscom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8086)|
| 2:14:49| who is our Senior Director of Public Works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8089)|
| 2:14:51| and the Building Inspections Department reports to her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8091)|
| 2:14:55| As I said, I was not directly involved in this decision, but I did review the decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8095)|
| 2:14:59| discussed it with the zoning officials and the Permits and Inspections Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8099)|
| 2:15:06| I did not find that the city made this in an arbitrary or capricious manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8106)|
| 2:15:09| I think that terminology was used earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8109)|
| 2:15:12| The city staff does have records where they reviewed this extensively,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8112)|
| 2:15:16| where they also had meetings to study the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8116)|
| 2:15:18| They also, Mr. DellaVolpe, did have legal input on that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8118)|
| 2:15:24| You found a record documenting that before the permit was issued?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8124)|
| 2:15:28| I have found Ms. Cash has documentation where they met with the legal department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8128)|
| 2:15:33| Okay. We'll have to see that. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8133)|
| 2:15:36| But I do think that Mr. Reynolds and Ms. Cash can probably speak better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8136)|
| 2:15:40| as to their decision-making process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8140)|
| 2:15:44| So, Ms. Cash, do you want to start?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8144)|
| 2:15:48| Thank you, Ms. Branscom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8148)|
| 2:15:50| Anita Cash, Zoning Coordinator for the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8150)|
| 2:15:54| I am probably the only current city employee who was involved in this from the very beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8154)|
| 2:16:01| I received a phone call from Gary Norman to come to his office to discuss this proposal by Gentry Griffey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8161)|
| 2:16:10| And I do want to say that we are inspectors, not expectors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8170)|
| 2:16:14| and we base our decisions on information that is provided to us until we find information on the contrary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8174)|
| 2:16:21| Gary said that he had received a call from Andy Powers, the architect for Gentry Griffey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8181)|
| 2:16:28| who wanted to install a constructed addition for installation of a crematorium at their funeral home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8188)|
| 2:16:38| And the very first question was, and who's going to be using this crematory?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8198)|
| 2:16:43| And I was told that it was only for the patrons that would be patronizing using Gentry Griffey for their services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8203)|
| 2:16:51| So we began to look in the zoning ordinance, and I was also involved in the dog crematory issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8211)|
| 2:16:59| That property was zoned I-3, and they were shut down by the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8219)|
| 2:17:03| I think one of the big things that people lose sight of is there is a difference in a freestanding crematory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8223)|
| 2:17:13| where all you do is what Mr. Della Volpe described is going on out in Rockford or Blount County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8233)|
| 2:17:20| That is, all they do is process these bodies and cremate them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8240)|
| 2:17:27| That is not what was explained to us that would be happening at Gentry Griffey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8247)|
| 2:17:32| We were told that they would come in, it would be families, as I said, who were using their facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8252)|
| 2:17:40| and instead of embalming, they would be choosing to have their loved ones cremated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8260)|
| 2:17:45| We began to look at the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8265)|
| 2:17:48| As has been stated here tonight, the funeral home is a permitted use in the O-1 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8268)|
| 2:17:54| Gentry Griffey has been in that location for many, many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8274)|
| 2:17:58| It has long, long, long been the practice, and it used to be in the building code that when you look to your codes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8278)|
| 2:18:08| if you do not have a definition for that specific item, then you go to a specific version of the dictionary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8288)|
| 2:18:20| So, Gary, as the building official, that dictionary is always kept in that office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8300)|
| 2:18:25| We got that dictionary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8305)|
| 2:18:26| We began to look at it, as you've already heard tonight by not only Mr. Della Volpe but members here in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8306)|
| 2:18:33| Based on all of the research that we did, and we talked about this on more than one occasion, twice that I know of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8313)|
| 2:18:40| and then Gary had some conversations with some other folks about it before our second meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8320)|
| 2:18:47| then he made the determination, and I concurred with his decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8327)|
| 2:18:52| that the accessory use, as had been presented to us by Gentry Griffey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8332)|
| 2:18:59| would be considered an appropriate accessory use in that zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8339)|
| 2:19:05| The plans review was submitted in February of 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8345)|
| 2:19:16| It does say on the plans review application, if you'll hold on just one second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8356)|
| 2:19:39| It was submitted February 22, 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8379)|
| 2:19:42| It says a one-story, 1,155-square-foot addition to an existing two-story commercial building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8382)|
| 2:19:50| for an existing tenant Gentry Griffey Funeral Home to be a crematorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8390)|
| 2:19:55| So that's on the original plans review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8395)|
| 2:19:58| There was also an additional plans review submitted for changes after the permit to move an accessible route| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8398)|
| 2:20:07| to delete a fire hydrant and some additional structural changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8407)|
| 2:20:12| So that was also done after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8412)|
| 2:20:15| Other than that, I just want to say that we are told all the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8415)|
| 2:20:21| that an interpretation can change every time the building official changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8421)|
| 2:20:28| And that has happened on more than one occasion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8428)|
| 2:20:32| Not anything nearly this significant, but I'm sure to others it would be significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8432)|
| 2:20:38| But the meetings were held.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8438)|
| 2:20:41| Gary did seek outside input, and that is how the decision was made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8441)|
| 2:20:47| They did submit for their permit February of 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8447)|
| 2:20:51| Their permit was issued in August of 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8451)|
| 2:20:57| Councilman Campin, pardon me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8457)|
| 2:20:59| Can I ask her a question before we're done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8459)|
| 2:21:01| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8461)|
| 2:21:04| When you met with Gary, did you write a note to the file describing the factors you looked at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8464)|
| 2:21:10| to make that decision back in 2011, early 2011?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8470)|
| 2:21:17| I don't usually attend any meeting that I do not take notes in, but I do not have it in the file, no, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8477)|
| 2:21:24| Okay, because I was told by the neighborhood group that they went and asked for the records,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8484)|
| 2:21:29| and they didn't have them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8489)|
| 2:21:30| And what was in the city's building file was the whole progression of drawings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8490)|
| 2:21:36| the comments on the drawings about do the pipes and this that way, the foundation issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8496)|
| 2:21:41| the building kind of structure things that the department does to make sure you get a sound physical structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8501)|
| 2:21:48| but not anything that related to this determination of is it appropriate in the O1 zone or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8508)|
| 2:21:57| I do not recall anyone specifically asking me for documentation that I had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8517)|
| 2:22:03| I was not aware that the neighborhood had put in a request for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8523)|
| 2:22:07| If I had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8527)|
| 2:22:08| If they came to Mr. Reynolds, he's your boss, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8528)|
| 2:22:10| Yes, sir, he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8530)|
| 2:22:11| He should have asked you if he had a legitimate document request if you had records in the department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8531)|
| 2:22:16| and he didn't ask you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8536)|
| 2:22:18| Not that I recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8538)|
| 2:22:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8539)|
| 2:22:21| Thank you very much for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8541)|
| 2:22:23| Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8543)|
| 2:22:24| Thank you, Madam Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8544)|
| 2:22:27| There's so many different angles to address this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8547)|
| 2:22:30| I think shortly and briefly there was an error at the city level and especially at the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8550)|
| 2:22:39| I mean, that's what the Board of Zoning Appeals is there for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8559)|
| 2:22:41| and I think this is a very clear case where it should have been looked at closer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8561)|
| 2:22:46| You know, let's forget the community involvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8566)|
| 2:22:48| Let's forget, you know, they don't have to do that as a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8568)|
| 2:22:52| The health concerns, I haven't seen anything that proves that the emissions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8572)|
| 2:22:57| and particulate that come from this facility will be completely safe for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8577)|
| 2:23:02| I have a big issue with that at the state or federal level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8582)|
| 2:23:06| So let's look at the changes in the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8586)|
| 2:23:09| I mean, at least 01 is a very poor place for this kind of facility, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8589)|
| 2:23:17| and that when you change the operation hours, should that be resubmitted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8597)|
| 2:23:24| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8604)|
| 2:23:25| Maybe someone can answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8605)|
| 2:23:26| But going from ten hours six days a week to 16 hours seven days a week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8606)|
| 2:23:31| and marking this as a facility for other counties, maybe someone can answer that from Gentry Griffey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8611)|
| 2:23:39| It's a bad situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8619)|
| 2:23:40| You have quality people, quality business against the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8620)|
| 2:23:43| As we've seen tonight, when you go forward with a development or a land use change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8623)|
| 2:23:47| it's good to involve the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8627)|
| 2:23:49| So maybe we would be in a different place now if we start on the front end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8629)|
| 2:23:52| and I'm sure our council and law director is getting a little heartburn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8632)|
| 2:23:56| considering where this could go if we were to rescind this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8636)|
| 2:24:00| But maybe a judge should decide where this goes, at least at that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8640)|
| 2:24:05| because I don't know that we're in a position to put this in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8645)|
| 2:24:11| I don't think it's not in my backyard issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8651)|
| 2:24:13| I think if this goes forward and other funeral homes apply to get incinerators at their funeral homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8653)|
| 2:24:20| in Bearden and other parts of the city of Knoxville, we should allow it then as an accessory, apparently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8660)|
| 2:24:28| And if we decide to pass laws that cut this off, then we have, in effect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8668)|
| 2:24:34| and no offense to the investors in the company, but a monopoly, for lack of a better term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8674)|
| 2:24:39| There will be one funeral crematory in Knoxville unless I think the industrial zoning is very appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8679)|
| 2:24:48| And I have a lot of concerns for Fountain City and our city citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8688)|
| 2:24:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8692)|
| 2:24:56| Councilman Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8696)|
| 2:24:59| This is a deadly issue, for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8699)|
| 2:25:05| This is a very difficult issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8705)|
| 2:25:07| I've been wrestling with it like everybody else for two reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8707)|
| 2:25:11| One, a crematory, I wasn't familiar with what a crematory was or is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8711)|
| 2:25:16| And so in my research, I went out to Maryville and saw that one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8716)|
| 2:25:21| and I visited what was built at Gentry Griffin over the weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8721)|
| 2:25:28| But what's even more, you know, what the other difficult part of this issue is the legal side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8728)|
| 2:25:36| You know, I'm not a scientist, but I do have legal training, and we need to ask what are we deciding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8736)|
| 2:25:45| You know, we're not deciding whether this is the right location for a crematory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8745)|
| 2:25:51| whether the crematory is an accessory use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8751)|
| 2:25:53| We're not deciding if it's dangerous to health or some of these other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8753)|
| 2:25:57| We're here to decide whether the building official who granted this permit did it in an arbitrary and capricious manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8757)|
| 2:26:06| And as much time as we've spent on this, we don't have the last say here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8766)|
| 2:26:12| If we grant this appeal, then I imagine Gentry Griffin is going to appeal this to a trial court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8772)|
| 2:26:22| And I can assure you what the trial court will look at is what happened at the Court of Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8782)|
| 2:26:28| And in that case, in the BMZ case, and it's a recent case, it's not old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8788)|
| 2:26:33| It's from 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8793)|
| 2:26:36| In that case, a funeral home applied for a permit, and the funeral home was actually in a non-conforming use with its own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8796)|
| 2:26:43| So it didn't even conform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8803)|
| 2:26:45| It applied for a permit, and the permit was denied by the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8805)|
| 2:26:51| And the crematory appealed this to the trial court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8811)|
| 2:26:56| and the trial court reversed and found that the city's decision was arbitrary, illegal, and capricious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8816)|
| 2:27:07| The trial court also awarded the plaintiff, in this case, was the crematory $10,000 in attorney fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8827)|
| 2:27:19| So if we approve this appeal, Gentry Griffin is going to appeal this to the trial court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8839)|
| 2:27:26| And then what happened, that's what happened to the trial court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8846)|
| 2:27:29| and the Court of Appeals affirmed this and said that a funeral home has a right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8849)|
| 2:27:35| And this was for a funeral home that was in a non-conforming use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8855)|
| 2:27:39| In this case, we have a funeral home that's in a conforming use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8859)|
| 2:27:42| They've gotten a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8862)|
| 2:27:43| I mean, it just seems just very unlikely that a trial court is going to go against the appellate court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8863)|
| 2:27:51| I mean, that's just the way the court systems operate in our state and country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8871)|
| 2:27:58| Somebody above us has made this decision that this was allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8878)|
| 2:28:03| So, you know, I'm sitting here, and, you know, I'm stuck between a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8883)|
| 2:28:09| I want to do what's best for the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8889)|
| 2:28:12| and I share some of the concerns of my colleagues about the whole process of the permit and that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8892)|
| 2:28:18| But I just know legally the other side is that it's going to get appealed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8898)|
| 2:28:24| If we grant the appeal, if we grant this appeal, this decision will be appealed tonight to a court that's going to reverse it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8904)|
| 2:28:31| It's just a temporary victory for the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8911)|
| 2:28:36| And the crematory would get a permit to operate a crematory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8916)|
| 2:28:43| And the city would expend considerable resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8923)|
| 2:28:46| and possibly have to pay for the attorneys of the crematory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8926)|
| 2:28:52| And that's just something I feel very uncomfortable with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8932)|
| 2:28:56| And with my, you know, what I know about law and reading this case, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8936)|
| 2:29:01| this seems very similar to the case we have here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8941)|
| 2:29:05| And I just don't see where we can go with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8945)|
| 2:29:10| You know, if the building inspector had not issued the permit and they were appealing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8950)|
| 2:29:14| I think it would be hard to say that was arbitrary and capricious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8954)|
| 2:29:17| But I can't say that the building, the gentleman that issued the billing permit was arbitrary and capricious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8957)|
| 2:29:28| when the Tennessee Court of Appeals has said that a crematory is part of a funeral home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8968)|
| 2:29:35| So that's my take on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8975)|
| 2:29:39| And, you know, I probably won't be able to support the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8979)|
| 2:29:44| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8984)|
| 2:29:45| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8985)|
| 2:29:47| With all due respect to my two lawyer colleagues here, I want to get down to some basics, some things that I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8987)|
| 2:29:55| First of all, I want to say that this has been, it's a tough decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=8995)|
| 2:30:00| We have a fantastic neighborhood that has worked well together over the years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9000)|
| 2:30:05| in a neighborhood that's on the upswing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9005)|
| 2:30:08| I also want to divulge the fact that my son and his wife live not too far from the funeral home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9008)|
| 2:30:15| In fact, they live right next to the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9015)|
| 2:30:17| My grandson and daughter and her husband also live near.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9017)|
| 2:30:21| They live on Esri Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9021)|
| 2:30:23| So I don't think I have a conflict of interest, but I do have family living in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9023)|
| 2:30:29| One thing that I wanted to find out, and this has to do with I do understand that what we're here is to talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9029)|
| 2:30:37| whether or not the building officials made the right decision or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9037)|
| 2:30:40| What I'm looking at is that what can we do or what can the funeral home do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9040)|
| 2:30:47| and what can the neighborhood do to come together to realize that one of the things that's happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9047)|
| 2:30:53| because this has come forward is that we have asked MPC to look into the whole issue of crematoriums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9053)|
| 2:31:00| And we're waiting to hear what they have to say in terms of the different zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9060)|
| 2:31:04| So what I'm wondering is what is possible or what we might be able to do to where both the funeral home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9064)|
| 2:31:10| and the neighborhood group can come to some kind of terms or an agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9070)|
| 2:31:15| For instance, I know that, and I don't know a lot about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9075)|
| 2:31:20| so some of you folks that are experts in this can help me on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9080)|
| 2:31:23| But, for instance, the air quality management group that supposedly looks at the air quality,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9083)|
| 2:31:30| what is it, once a year, I think, Mr. Seymour, in terms of doing reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9090)|
| 2:31:35| Would it be possible, for instance, and I'm just throwing out some examples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9095)|
| 2:31:39| Would it be possible, for instance, for the funeral home to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9099)|
| 2:31:42| in the first year of operation, we're going to have a review in three months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9102)|
| 2:31:47| We want another test done in six months and another one done in nine months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9107)|
| 2:31:51| And then thereafter, we'll have one done in every six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9111)|
| 2:31:55| Something like that, if that's possible, to help let all of us know what is coming out of the chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9115)|
| 2:32:02| The other thing is there's a concern about the mercury factor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9122)|
| 2:32:05| I don't know enough about incinerators to know, you know, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9125)|
| 2:32:11| I did talk to one of the neighborhood folks about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9131)|
| 2:32:14| what happens if you go ahead and put scrubbers on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9134)|
| 2:32:16| From what I understand, it is supposed to be a state-of-the-art retort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9136)|
| 2:32:21| but is that a possibility to alleviate some of the concerns of the neighbors and the neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9141)|
| 2:32:28| The other thing that I thought was interesting, and I believe, who gave us this report?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9148)|
| 2:32:36| In the NSAFE report that we were given, I just want to read a couple of things that came to light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9156)|
| 2:32:44| NSAFE, who air emissions from potential Spring Hill Cemetery in Spring Hill, Tennessee, they talk about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9164)|
| 2:32:51| this is on page eight, item 3.1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9171)|
| 2:32:55| They say there are currently 45 human crematories that have air permits in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9175)|
| 2:33:01| Based on a Google Earth analysis of those 45 locations, addresses were available for all but one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9181)|
| 2:33:08| It appears that all but six are located in residential or commercial areas where people live and work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9188)|
| 2:33:14| According to the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation air pollution control staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9194)|
| 2:33:19| as well as the staff of three or four local air pollution programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9199)|
| 2:33:23| there are currently no crematories operating in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9203)|
| 2:33:26| In spite of the fact that most are located in populated areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9206)|
| 2:33:29| there have been very few complaints about crematories from the public on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9209)|
| 2:33:34| This is from the NSAFE.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9214)|
| 2:33:36| It also goes on to say that it talks about the estimates of emissions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9216)|
| 2:33:42| And one of the things that caught my eye was it said based on emission factors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9222)|
| 2:33:47| it goes on to say that crematories are roughly three orders of magnitude,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9227)|
| 2:33:52| are lower than estimated emissions from residential wood stoves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9232)|
| 2:33:56| And it goes on and quotes other things in the NSAFE report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9236)|
| 2:34:00| Part of the concern or part of what I've been going through is that all of a sudden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9240)|
| 2:34:05| I guess all of us on council are becoming experts in crematories| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9245)|
| 2:34:10| and this sort of thing with all the information that we've been inundated with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9250)|
| 2:34:13| But, again, I go back to Mr. Seymour, whether or not there are ways in which both the funeral home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9253)|
| 2:34:20| and the neighborhood may be able to come together on some agreements in terms of the safety concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9260)|
| 2:34:27| that they have for the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9267)|
| 2:34:44| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9284)|
| 2:34:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9285)|
| 2:34:46| As I understand, maybe three questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9286)|
| 2:34:50| Let me try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9290)|
| 2:34:51| On inspections, Gentry Griffey is happy to be inspected at any time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9291)|
| 2:34:57| and we will call for inspections and will have to call the Knox County Air Board for inspections when we open up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9297)|
| 2:35:05| We will welcome inspections at any time, and we will ask to be inspected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9305)|
| 2:35:10| The unit itself does some monitoring, and those records are available for anybody to look at at any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9310)|
| 2:35:22| I also might add that the Air Pollution Control Board or Knox County will inspect any time there is a complaint made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9322)|
| 2:35:32| my understanding also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9332)|
| 2:35:34| So, yes, we will be happy on the inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9334)|
| 2:35:37| The scrubbers, Mr. Botch, you checked again with the manufacturer of the unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9337)|
| 2:35:45| Scrubbers are not necessary on this because let me give you a lawyer's explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9345)|
| 2:35:52| The body is burned, cremated in one chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9352)|
| 2:35:57| The air that comes out of that chamber goes into another chamber where it is also incinerated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9357)|
| 2:36:06| And basically, all you receive outside are some particulate matter, which we're subject to the permit on, heat and air.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9366)|
| 2:36:20| Now, we understand scrubbers are not a practical way for this to be handled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9380)|
| 2:36:27| On the mercury issue, which seems to be the main concern and the issue that is continuously raised,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9387)|
| 2:36:33| those come from fillings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9393)|
| 2:36:38| And I think dentists have stopped using fillings some time ago, typically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9398)|
| 2:36:44| So that problem is long-term going away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9404)|
| 2:36:49| Are there any kind of tests or any kind of ways to check today in terms of mercury output?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9409)|
| 2:37:00| Yes, yes, there will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9420)|
| 2:37:05| Yeah, and the NSAFE study said also that a crematory unit would have to run nonstop for a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9425)|
| 2:37:14| with each of the bodies having 17 or more dental fillings before there's an issue on mercury.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9434)|
| 2:37:21| So certainly you're talking about 100 to 150 funerals a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9441)|
| 2:37:27| Probably half will last for cremation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9447)|
| 2:37:31| Maybe more as we go forward because cremation was not traditional in the South,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9451)|
| 2:37:37| but it is becoming more traditional in the metropolitan areas in the South.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9457)|
| 2:37:44| Maybe what I can do is ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9464)|
| 2:37:47| I was trying to make a note of the issues you raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9467)|
| 2:37:51| Well, let me ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9471)|
| 2:37:52| Maybe Ms. Rowe can come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9472)|
| 2:37:54| Is there any way that there can be some good understanding on both people's part in order to move this thing forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9474)|
| 2:38:03| Ms. Rowe or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9483)|
| 2:38:07| Well, whoever, someone from that side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9487)|
| 2:38:10| Are there some things that can be done besides this standoff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9490)|
| 2:38:14| And then both of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9494)|
| 2:38:16| Mr. Griffey will be very open, and records of the Knox County Board are a matter of public record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9496)|
| 2:38:24| Yes, my name is Randy Kurth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9504)|
| 2:38:26| I live at 4016 Sam Cooper Lane in Knoxville, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9506)|
| 2:38:30| and I have 21 years' experience in the environmental consulting field doing assessment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9510)|
| 2:38:35| and remediation of hazardous waste.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9515)|
| 2:38:37| And typically for air monitoring, they'll do quarterly monitoring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9517)|
| 2:38:41| The type of monitoring they're going to do now is paper records monitoring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9521)|
| 2:38:45| Right now in the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9525)|
| 2:38:47| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9527)|
| 2:38:48| We're getting static up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9528)|
| 2:38:49| I didn't hear what you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9529)|
| 2:38:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9530)|
| 2:38:51| Right now in the permit, the only requirement that they have is a paper thing of checking paper records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9531)|
| 2:38:56| There are no requirements to do any monitoring except for temperature and whether it's opaque, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9536)|
| 2:39:03| the smoke that's coming out of there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9543)|
| 2:39:05| The toxic things that are going to be coming out of there, elemental mercury from the amalgam fillings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9545)|
| 2:39:10| 50% of the fillings are mercury.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9550)|
| 2:39:12| That is not you can't incinerate elemental mercury.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9552)|
| 2:39:15| That mercury is going to volatilize and go out into the air.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9555)|
| 2:39:19| Now, they could go ahead and monitor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9559)|
| 2:39:21| You could use Tetler bags, or you could use summa canisters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9561)|
| 2:39:26| and they'll typically go up to the top of the stack, go ahead and collect an effluent sample,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9566)|
| 2:39:30| and submit that to a lab.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9570)|
| 2:39:32| It's not an expensive process, and it's a way to definitely look at what the contaminants are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9572)|
| 2:39:37| and what levels that they're coming out at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9577)|
| 2:39:39| And right now in that permit, there are no requirements to look at any hazardous constituents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9579)|
| 2:39:44| just broad categories in a paper, a theoretical paper study in that permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9584)|
| 2:39:50| Who would do a study like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9590)|
| 2:39:53| There are plenty of companies in the area that do air testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9593)|
| 2:39:56| There are lots of consulting firms that do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9596)|
| 2:39:59| It's a service that they provide, and it's relatively inexpensive to go ahead and do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9599)|
| 2:40:05| They collect the sample, they submit it to a state-certified lab,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9605)|
| 2:40:09| and then the results come back from the lab within 21 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9609)|
| 2:40:12| Would this be something that the neighborhood would feel more comfortable about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9612)|
| 2:40:17| In the type of business that I've been in for years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9617)|
| 2:40:19| and what I know about elemental mercury and the type of materials that come off of these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9619)|
| 2:40:24| I would definitely want to see some type of testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9624)|
| 2:40:28| If they claim that there are no toxins or anything, that's fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9628)|
| 2:40:33| but let them go ahead and do the sampling to go ahead and demonstrate that that is a fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9633)|
| 2:40:38| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9638)|
| 2:40:39| Mr. Seymour, is this something that I feel like I'm a negotiator up here, which I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9639)|
| 2:40:44| I'm just trying to find out if there's ways in which we can get both parties on the same page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9644)|
| 2:40:50| I would like to stand up here and say yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9650)|
| 2:40:52| but can we investigate that and see what's involved in getting the mercury monitor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9652)|
| 2:41:01| Our market area is Fountain City, and we, Gentry Griffey, will be happy to explore that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9661)|
| 2:41:10| and share any information we obtain with everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9670)|
| 2:41:19| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9679)|
| 2:41:21| Thank you, Madam Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9681)|
| 2:41:26| Mr. Grave, I really appreciate your suggestions and Mr. Dellavopi and certainly Mr. Kampen's comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9686)|
| 2:41:32| And I think we're all sensitive to the entire community's concerns and issues with this whole situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9692)|
| 2:41:41| But I need to ask our city attorney, Mr. Swanson, if, in your opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9701)|
| 2:41:52| proper protocol procedures have been followed and we are at the right juncture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9712)|
| 2:42:00| And then I want to ask a similar question to our council attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9720)|
| 2:42:05| Short answer, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9725)|
| 2:42:08| So you do feel like all of the proper procedures was not capricious and arbitrary at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9728)|
| 2:42:15| I think that our codes enforcement people did their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9735)|
| 2:42:20| They did what their task to do with regard to making the decision in this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9740)|
| 2:42:26| and they made a decision based on their best understanding of what the law was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9746)|
| 2:42:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9753)|
| 2:42:34| And, Mr. Frost, what is our role here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9754)|
| 2:42:41| I heard what Mr. Seymour said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9761)|
| 2:42:44| Tell us, in your opinion, what our role is relative to the BZA decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9764)|
| 2:42:49| Well, Councilman Saunders, City Council needs to decide whether the city building official's decision was correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9769)|
| 2:42:58| based on the information and factors that he reviewed and the information presented at the time to support his decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9778)|
| 2:43:07| Not all permits that are sought do have to go through a public review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9787)|
| 2:43:16| In many circumstances, people doing work on their homes does not go through a public review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9796)|
| 2:43:21| However, there are some circumstances that they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9801)|
| 2:43:26| I'm certainly cognizant of the fact and can feel Councilman Della Voppe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9806)|
| 2:43:32| and Councilman Kampen's passion on this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9812)|
| 2:43:37| But, you know, a review of the records show the process that the applicant went through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9817)|
| 2:43:45| The applicant received permits, and as part of the administrative process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9825)|
| 2:43:53| the local governments appear to have issued certificates of completion and certificates of occupancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9833)|
| 2:44:05| And if those were, you know, issued correctly, if the applicant met those requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9845)|
| 2:44:13| they may become entitled to their approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9853)|
| 2:44:18| I mean, ultimately, I might have to disagree in court with Mr. Swanson on this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9858)|
| 2:44:23| But I think, you know, this Council needs to take into account what has been in the record at BZA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9863)|
| 2:44:32| what has been placed into the record this evening, and listen to the speakers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9872)|
| 2:44:40| including those charged with the ultimate responsibility of issuing the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9880)|
| 2:44:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9887)|
| 2:44:51| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9891)|
| 2:44:53| I'd like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9893)|
| 2:44:55| I mean, I think we can sit here and it's arguable at the very least that the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9895)|
| 2:45:02| that they did not, you know, just arbitrarily grant this permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9902)|
| 2:45:07| We could argue that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9907)|
| 2:45:09| I think we're on the right track with Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9909)|
| 2:45:11| And I would propose, I'd make a motion that we postpone this for 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9911)|
| 2:45:15| and give both sides the opportunity to sit down and come back with a proposal that's fair to both of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9915)|
| 2:45:22| And I think it's far too severe to come out here with a 5-4 vote that's going to hurt the city, potentially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9922)|
| 2:45:30| and hurt the neighborhood, potentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9930)|
| 2:45:32| And this business has relied on a permit that was granted by the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9932)|
| 2:45:36| So I make a motion that we postpone it 30 days, give both sides a chance to work out a compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9936)|
| 2:45:43| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9943)|
| 2:45:46| Well, this is a priority, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9946)|
| 2:45:49| Point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9949)|
| 2:45:50| Is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9950)|
| 2:45:51| Can we do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9951)|
| 2:45:53| Yeah, it's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9953)|
| 2:45:54| Can we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9954)|
| 2:45:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9955)|
| 2:45:56| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9956)|
| 2:46:01| Can I ask a question before we decide that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9961)|
| 2:46:05| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9965)|
| 2:46:06| Ask the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9966)|
| 2:46:07| What happens in sort of this cooling off period?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9967)|
| 2:46:10| Because, I mean, I agree with you that this is a very difficult question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9970)|
| 2:46:14| and there is merit on both sides of this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9974)|
| 2:46:19| What happens in the next 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9979)|
| 2:46:21| Are we burning bodies or are we talking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9981)|
| 2:46:24| Are cremations now being taken place at Griffey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9984)|
| 2:46:28| None have as of this writing, but we anticipate that they will shortly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9988)|
| 2:46:33| But none have yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9993)|
| 2:46:35| So the fact that we were given a picture of, is that an actual cremation that's taken place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=9995)|
| 2:46:43| Not at Gentry-Griffey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10003)|
| 2:46:45| And I haven't seen the photograph you're referring to, Counselor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10005)|
| 2:46:50| The problem is we do have a certificate of occupancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10010)|
| 2:46:55| There was some question about mercury testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10015)|
| 2:46:58| Until we start doing cremations, there's no way to do mercury testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10018)|
| 2:47:02| So we would assume that we would have the right to go ahead and perform cremations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10022)|
| 2:47:10| Well, if there are mercury tests approved for mercury, are you all in a position to correct that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10030)|
| 2:47:20| I mean, you know, you have to be in a position to take action to change that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10040)|
| 2:47:24| Are you all in a position to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10044)|
| 2:47:26| Well, we have warranties from the manufacturing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10046)|
| 2:47:28| And we are assured that this operation will be, there's no mercury hazard present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10048)|
| 2:47:39| So the photo that was submitted was not of Griffey-Gentry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10059)|
| 2:47:45| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10065)|
| 2:47:46| I have not seen the photograph.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10066)|
| 2:47:47| If I could, I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10067)|
| 2:47:50| I don't think it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10070)|
| 2:47:51| No, no, that's not us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10071)|
| 2:47:54| This is the Blount County one, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10074)|
| 2:48:02| This morning, I took that photo to show that the comments that we've heard since the beginning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10082)|
| 2:48:09| was that there will be no smoke, no odor, nothing but heat coming out the stack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10089)|
| 2:48:14| So I sat over there and waited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10094)|
| 2:48:16| Theirs is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10096)|
| 2:48:17| Okay, theirs is not operational at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10097)|
| 2:48:19| I think that's a point of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10099)|
| 2:48:23| Okay, so there was a motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10103)|
| 2:48:25| There was no second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10105)|
| 2:48:27| So that dies for lack of a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10107)|
| 2:48:30| Okay, let's see who was next in speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10110)|
| 2:48:33| Mayor Brown, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10113)|
| 2:48:35| I have one question of Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10115)|
| 2:48:37| I've been listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10117)|
| 2:48:39| I hope that we go ahead and vote tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10119)|
| 2:48:41| But is it going to cause really a financial hardship for this funeral home that's been in business for a number of years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10121)|
| 2:48:50| if the crematorium is not allowed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10130)|
