| 0:00:00| When they first came out, they weren't abundantly clear if they applied to local auditing committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=0)|
| 0:00:05| There's no interpretive case law. There's no statutory history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5)|
| 0:00:09| So I went to the source and essentially spoke to folks in the legislature and ultimately the state comptroller,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9)|
| 0:00:14| and they said, well, for now, yes, it applies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=14)|
| 0:00:16| So this is the hand you've been dealt thus far,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=16)|
| 0:00:18| and one of them is that you will establish a confidential hotline, so to speak, to take auditing questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=18)|
| 0:00:26| Likewise, that certain things you'll conduct can be done in an executive session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=26)|
| 0:00:31| which is counterintuitive to a body politic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=31)|
| 0:00:33| So until there's an ultimate determinative decision as to whether or not this is going to continue to apply to counties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=33)|
| 0:00:40| at this juncture, it seems to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=40)|
| 0:00:43| And, Mr. Chairman, if I could, to speak to what Mr. Jarrett just spoke to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=43)|
| 0:00:49| setting up this type of hotline procedure is not trivial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=49)|
| 0:00:53| We've spent time as a committee, time that you would have to spend as commission if we weren't doing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=53)|
| 0:00:58| investigating different vendors that do this work, inviting these vendors to present to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=58)|
| 0:01:04| We would have moved more quickly on this if we had had less other distractions, let's just say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=64)|
| 0:01:10| But they're presenting at our meeting the first Tuesday in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=70)|
| 0:01:16| So if this is an issue that commission in general has a strong interest in, consider this your invitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=76)|
| 0:01:22| But we will have two vendors there the first Tuesday in November presenting to us on different options that the county has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=82)|
| 0:01:31| in terms of a hotline system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=91)|
| 0:01:34| Commissioner Luther.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=94)|
| 0:01:36| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=96)|
| 0:01:39| I had a question as to before we got into 905, should we not talk about 906?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=99)|
| 0:01:46| Because 906 is a resolution of commission expressing the will of commission as it relates to the role of audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=106)|
| 0:01:55| And it sounds like now we're almost discussing both at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=115)|
| 0:02:02| And because we need to decide if we like the direction this audit committee is going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=122)|
| 0:02:11| before we start getting into the details of this charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=131)|
| 0:02:17| But I guess we're going to go ahead and talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=137)|
| 0:02:20| And maybe once we discuss 905, 906 may become a moot point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=140)|
| 0:02:25| But I was just going to try to interject that about 20, 30 minutes ago before we got further down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=145)|
| 0:02:36| Mr. Law Director, as you read over the charter for the audit committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=156)|
| 0:02:47| do you feel like they have gone the minimum of what state law requires them to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=167)|
| 0:02:55| or have they gone well beyond in your opinion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=175)|
| 0:03:00| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=180)|
| 0:03:01| We received it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=181)|
| 0:03:02| Of course, I think Dr. Carsello asserted that we did edit it quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=182)|
| 0:03:08| We don't want to look at it in a vacuum, so we try to look at it from both a public administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=188)|
| 0:03:11| but more so a legal perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=191)|
| 0:03:13| But I would say it's defensible within the confines of the law, clearly, because it wasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=193)|
| 0:03:20| I would certainly assert that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=200)|
| 0:03:22| In fact, there was some language that I thought was contrary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=202)|
| 0:03:24| and I just struck it without even comment and said I'm not even going to let the commission see this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=204)|
| 0:03:28| It's contrary to state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=208)|
| 0:03:29| So as a lot of these legislative enactments, the legislature said write an audit charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=209)|
| 0:03:35| and it didn't give parameters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=215)|
| 0:03:37| It just said do it and then file it with us and we'll look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=217)|
| 0:03:40| So I don't see anything in there that's contrary to Tennessee law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=220)|
| 0:03:45| Do you think that in your opinion, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=225)|
| 0:03:48| have they just done sort of the bare minimum to be within what state law requires| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=228)|
| 0:03:54| or do you feel that they've far reached in asking for additional powers or authority?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=234)|
| 0:04:06| I don't think it's overreaching, sir, because, again, it appears that the state intent was to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=246)|
| 0:04:11| for the whole purpose of having an audit committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=251)|
| 0:04:13| was to relieve the body politic of having to deal with these day-to-day issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=253)|
| 0:04:16| and to try to attract people with an expertise in the field to actually do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=256)|
| 0:04:20| So it seems to be the intent of the legislature for this committee to be beyond your typical advisory committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=260)|
| 0:04:26| but actually have enumerated duties and responsibilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=266)|
| 0:04:30| But I don't see where it â€“ from a legal standpoint, I don't think it's overreaching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=270)|
| 0:04:35| In terms of whether or not that's within the commission's philosophy, that's a policy decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=275)|
| 0:04:42| John King has stated that there are a few things that were left a little bit undefined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=282)|
| 0:04:52| and maybe we should have a little bit of a workshop to make sure we nail down exactly what this means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=292)|
| 0:04:59| Do you perceive that there may be a few loose ends out there that we should tie up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=299)|
| 0:05:08| Well, again, you know, I think Dr. Carsell has said it best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=308)|
| 0:05:12| You're never going to have a document that's going to please everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=312)|
| 0:05:14| There's always going to be somebody who's going to take exception with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=314)|
| 0:05:19| I think the commission has to look at it, first of all, you know, from a policy standpoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=319)|
| 0:05:24| and its structure and function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=324)|
| 0:05:26| What exactly do you expect of the committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=326)|
| 0:05:29| I mean, it can always be tweaked, I imagine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=329)|
| 0:05:31| but you have a national expert looking at it from an auditing standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=331)|
| 0:05:35| I would merely look at it from a legal standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=335)|
| 0:05:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=338)|
| 0:05:40| John, is there anything you'd like to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=340)|
| 0:05:44| As everybody recognizes, I'm not a national expert on the subject of audit committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=344)|
| 0:05:48| I don't pretend to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=348)|
| 0:05:51| But I've spent a lot of years knocking around state and local governments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=351)|
| 0:05:57| and I think it's important that you have advice and people involved, such as Dr. Carsell, in a matter such as this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=357)|
| 0:06:07| But if you stop and think about a number of the things that have been said here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=367)|
| 0:06:12| it highlights, I believe, the importance of knowing what the parameters are in the first instance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=372)|
| 0:06:21| when you're going into this as opposed to finding out what they are later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=381)|
| 0:06:26| Now, to illustrate the point, everybody is correct in that the law says they're going to create a process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=386)|
| 0:06:38| by which people can confidentially report to the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=398)|
| 0:06:44| And then it says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=404)|
| 0:06:46| The detailed information received by whom, the audit committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=406)|
| 0:06:53| received pursuant to such a report of illegal, improper, wasteful, or fraudulent activity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=413)|
| 0:07:00| or any investigation thereof, except those matters disclosed in the final report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=420)|
| 0:07:07| would be considered audit working papers and would be confidential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=427)|
| 0:07:12| They're not even available to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=432)|
| 0:07:15| It's confidential to the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=435)|
| 0:07:18| That's another reason why I think it's important that you know at the time you're approving a charter for this group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=438)|
| 0:07:27| what the procedures are that they're going to utilize in conducting, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=447)|
| 0:07:34| an investigation of those reports and how that's going to occur, what the consequences are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=454)|
| 0:07:40| On the front end, I'm not saying they're not supposed to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=460)|
| 0:07:43| I'm just saying that it would be wise, I think, that this body know what those are going to be before you approve them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=463)|
| 0:07:52| You're approving it here and now, whatever it is that is hereafter established.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=472)|
| 0:07:59| I see that as a potential problem, and I'm not counseling assassination of this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=479)|
| 0:08:08| I'm not suggesting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=488)|
| 0:08:10| I'm certainly not questioning the expertise of those involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=490)|
| 0:08:14| or the commitment of the current membership of that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=494)|
| 0:08:18| I'm just saying that from the practical standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=498)|
| 0:08:24| you have some issues that I believe can be cleared or at least substantially minimized on the front end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=504)|
| 0:08:32| and I would suggest that you ought to consider that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=512)|
| 0:08:36| Thank you, Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=516)|
| 0:08:37| That's why I sort of get back to I really wish we had got into 906 really months ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=517)|
| 0:08:44| so that we could have discussed what we expected out of an audit committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=524)|
| 0:08:48| before they went to all the work of trying to come up with a charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=528)|
| 0:08:52| and then present it to us and then for us to go back and try to critique it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=532)|
| 0:08:58| I really wish we could have got onto 906 first, but we're not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=538)|
| 0:09:03| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=543)|
| 0:09:05| Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=545)|
| 0:09:07| I'm going to speak just in general terms and not about some of the specifics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=547)|
| 0:09:12| that we've brought up with the charter for the audit committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=552)|
| 0:09:15| but it really deals with what the audit committee is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=555)|
| 0:09:18| and how it differs from some of the other committees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=558)|
| 0:09:20| such as the ethics committee that's been brought up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=560)|
| 0:09:23| First of all, as Commissioner Wright has pointed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=563)|
| 0:09:26| the audit committee is a committee of this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=566)|
| 0:09:30| which means they do some of the work and we have their expertise to look at things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=570)|
| 0:09:35| that we maybe as individuals do not have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=575)|
| 0:09:38| and I think that's part of the reason why we appreciate so much Dr. Casello| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=578)|
| 0:09:44| and Ms. Kaiser, who is another of the citizen members of the committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=584)|
| 0:09:49| the work that they can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=589)|
| 0:09:51| I know just listening when I attend some of the audit committee meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=591)|
| 0:09:56| we're arguing about blue book and red book and yellow book things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=596)|
| 0:09:59| I don't even have a clue as to what those things are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=599)|
| 0:10:02| and that's why we depend upon people at the audit committee to then be able to come back to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=602)|
| 0:10:08| and give us their expertise on what that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=608)|
| 0:10:11| Also, it's very easy for someone literally to either send me an e-mail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=611)|
| 0:10:16| or to catch me in the halls out here and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=616)|
| 0:10:19| well, do you know what's going on in blank, blank office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=619)|
| 0:10:22| And I think that's the other advantage that they have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=622)|
| 0:10:25| is that we can refer those cases to them to see if there is credibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=625)|
| 0:10:28| before we go down the path of asking our internal auditor to do an audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=628)|
| 0:10:33| When the audit comes back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=633)|
| 0:10:34| the audit committee allows professionals to review some of the results| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=634)|
| 0:10:40| and then give their recommendations back to this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=640)|
| 0:10:44| And so I think the point I'm trying to make is that this audit committee works for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=644)|
| 0:10:48| This is a committee of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=648)|
| 0:10:51| One of the things, and always just like I am when a lot of people speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=651)|
| 0:10:56| when John King and Mike Rubel speak, I want to listen because I respect them very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=656)|
| 0:11:02| But also, since this is our committee, it's not like trying to deal with changing a charter amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=662)|
| 0:11:08| You really caught my attention, Mr. King, when you talked about unintended consequences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=668)|
| 0:11:12| because those things are so hard to change once they've been codified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=672)|
| 0:11:17| Sometimes we have to go back through a two-thirds vote of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=677)|
| 0:11:20| We have to go back to the voters with something on the charter if an error is made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=680)|
| 0:11:25| This is our committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=685)|
| 0:11:26| The ethics committee, it's very difficult to change their charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=686)|
| 0:11:29| because we don't control the ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=689)|
| 0:11:31| But if we do find as we go through the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=691)|
| 0:11:34| and we do need to tinker with certain things, we need to make adjustments to make it work better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=694)|
| 0:11:40| I think it will be a lot easier to do on the audit committee than it will some of these other committees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=700)|
| 0:11:45| once we have an ordinance or a charter amendment in front of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=705)|
| 0:11:49| because there it is very difficult to change those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=709)|
| 0:11:52| And really it's for that reason both if you're looking at Resolution 906,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=712)|
| 0:11:58| which deals with the will of the commission as it relates to the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=718)|
| 0:12:02| You know, I support what the audit committee is doing because I think we need their expertise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=722)|
| 0:12:07| And also on Resolution 905,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=727)|
| 0:12:10| I don't think we're ever going to get a charter that satisfies every member of this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=730)|
| 0:12:16| and I'm willing to make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=736)|
| 0:12:17| When I look at this, there are certain things that I don't like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=737)|
| 0:12:19| but I think as a whole, the body of the whole of the charter, it's a good charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=739)|
| 0:12:24| And if we need to go back and make adjustments on it to make it better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=744)|
| 0:12:28| it's a lot easier than some of the other things we're dealing with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=748)|
| 0:12:33| such as ordinances and charter amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=753)|
| 0:12:36| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=756)|
| 0:12:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=758)|
| 0:12:41| Did everybody read Joe's memo that he sent this morning, the big one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=761)|
| 0:12:47| Well, there's three things in there that really stood out to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=767)|
| 0:12:51| when we're talking about the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=771)|
| 0:12:53| and that's that the audit committee charter has been vetted with the Tennessee State Comptroller's Office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=773)|
| 0:13:00| and their suggested changes have been incorporated in the document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=780)|
| 0:13:03| The audit committee charter has been vetted with KPMG,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=783)|
| 0:13:07| an international public accounting firm with substantial expertise in auditing governmental entities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=787)|
| 0:13:13| and their suggested changes have been incorporated in the document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=793)|
| 0:13:16| and the audit committee has worked closely with Knox County Law Department in drafting the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=796)|
| 0:13:22| and they have closely followed the law department's suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=802)|
| 0:13:26| The only party that has, I'm sorry, this is the fourth one, not three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=806)|
| 0:13:29| the only party that has expressed reservations is Mr. Mike Rubel of the Sheriff's Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=809)|
| 0:13:35| and both the audit committee and the Knox County Law Department carefully considered Mr. Rubel's suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=815)|
| 0:13:42| So that, to me, says a lot in a very short amount of space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=822)|
| 0:13:53| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=833)|
| 0:13:55| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=835)|
| 0:13:56| I guess my first question is to the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=836)|
| 0:13:58| Everything that Mr. Carcillo has said with regards to state law and our obligations under that law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=838)|
| 0:14:04| do you disagree with any of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=844)|
| 0:14:06| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=846)|
| 0:14:07| So we are basically under state mandates on a lot of these types of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=847)|
| 0:14:12| I would also point out that this commission established an internal auditor back in 2001,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=852)|
| 0:14:18| which was four years before the establishment of this act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=858)|
| 0:14:21| and so I guess we were a little bit ahead of our time because at that time we found that other bodies of our size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=861)|
| 0:14:28| or counties of our size already had departments of internal audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=868)|
| 0:14:30| so we were a little bit behind the curve in terms of what our colleagues were doing across the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=870)|
| 0:14:35| This has been a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=875)|
| 0:14:36| I want to applaud the members of the audit committee, our commissioners, the people who have served on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=876)|
| 0:14:41| If you've been to any of those meetings, they're not 30-minute meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=881)|
| 0:14:44| and they're not sitting around drinking coffee and having croissants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=884)|
| 0:14:47| I mean, they're rolling up their sleeves, working, and many of those meetings have gone five, six, eight hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=887)|
| 0:14:53| So they have put a lot of time and effort into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=893)|
| 0:14:57| It is very important that we have a strong audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=897)|
| 0:15:01| Why is that important?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=901)|
| 0:15:04| It is important because they are dealing with our money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=904)|
| 0:15:09| And any time you're dealing with somebody's money, you want to make sure that it's being done properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=909)|
| 0:15:13| Just look at what we're doing right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=913)|
| 0:15:15| We have approved a payroll audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=915)|
| 0:15:18| Why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=918)|
| 0:15:19| Because there are allegations of phantom employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=919)|
| 0:15:22| There are allegations that individuals have written themselves checks for large amounts of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=922)|
| 0:15:26| That's why we're doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=926)|
| 0:15:28| If everybody did what they were supposed to do, we wouldn't need an audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=928)|
| 0:15:32| We wouldn't need to do any investigations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=932)|
| 0:15:34| We wouldn't need to do any of these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=934)|
| 0:15:36| And so this is why we have to keep everyone honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=936)|
| 0:15:39| If you're in private business, you can be audited at any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=939)|
| 0:15:43| You don't have to take a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=943)|
| 0:15:45| You don't have to come in and give anybody notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=945)|
| 0:15:48| Your auditors show up at the front door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=948)|
| 0:15:50| They come walking in, and they say, we're here, and show us your records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=950)|
| 0:15:53| It keeps everybody honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=953)|
| 0:15:54| Again, you're dealing with people's money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=954)|
| 0:15:56| And when you're dealing with people's money, it's very serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=956)|
| 0:15:59| We are taking it very seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=959)|
| 0:16:01| That's why it's important that we have, I believe, a strong audit committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=961)|
| 0:16:05| so that we can look at it from the standpoint that it's done professionally, not politically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=965)|
| 0:16:10| You're never going to get politics out of things in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=970)|
| 0:16:13| However, I think that by having a strong audit committee, a good charter, we're taking a step in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=973)|
| 0:16:20| So I'm going to be in support of the charter today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=980)|
| 0:16:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=982)|
| 0:16:24| Commissioner Armstrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=984)|
| 0:16:26| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=986)|
| 0:16:29| I've read over this charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=989)|
| 0:16:31| I feel that we have beyond reproach in terms of our expertise by no means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=991)|
| 0:16:39| Do I have a problem with the, if you will, the external leadership beyond commission here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=999)|
| 0:16:45| that's representing us in this charter and is representing us in this audit committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1005)|
| 0:16:50| Again, I applaud Dr. Grisella and his willingness to come and work with Knox County in this particular endeavor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1010)|
| 0:17:01| The only thing that really kind of troubles me, and we're coming back to a procedural thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1021)|
| 0:17:08| and I'm almost with Commissioner Anders on the possibility that we have here for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1028)|
| 0:17:17| it's not clearly defined in here to me how we are procedurally going to avoid witch hunts within county government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1037)|
| 0:17:25| Based upon the history of Knox County, which is notorious for this type of activity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1045)|
| 0:17:33| I do see that that might be a weak spot in our charter that is not clear to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1053)|
| 0:17:40| Other than that, I don't have a whole lot of heartburn with what it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1060)|
| 0:17:43| and I do not have any doubt whatsoever that this particular audit committee would be up above board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1063)|
| 0:17:51| straightforward, professional, and without a doubt deal with that very issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1071)|
| 0:17:57| But as we all know, time passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1077)|
| 0:18:00| The body of this audit committee will change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1080)|
| 0:18:05| The body politic within this room will change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1085)|
| 0:18:09| and I would just hope that we would have some parameters in here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1089)|
| 0:18:13| so that when we lose the expertise of Dr. Grisella, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1093)|
| 0:18:19| and are not able to replace that kind of expertise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1099)|
| 0:18:23| we will have his wisdom in writing to guide future people who are on this committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1103)|
| 0:18:29| and who can take this committee into the next generation of Knox County politics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1109)|
| 0:18:35| and the next generation of Knox County government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1115)|
| 0:18:38| So on the face of it, I am in agreement that we have a charter, that it's a decent charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1118)|
| 0:18:45| that we're going in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1125)|
| 0:18:47| But that one little piece where I'm not really clear is what gives me some concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1127)|
| 0:18:54| I'm leaning towards supporting this, but I would really like to have some kind of, as a mission for this charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1134)|
| 0:19:01| if you would like to address my concerns, Dr. Grisella, do you agree or disagree where I'm coming from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1141)|
| 0:19:09| I understand your concern, Commissioner Armstrong, and appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1149)|
| 0:19:12| And part of the challenge is the language in the state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1152)|
| 0:19:17| So clearly we have to work with that language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1157)|
| 0:19:20| and try to find a way to make our procedures consonant with the state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1160)|
| 0:19:24| but sensitive to the concerns that you and Commissioner Anders have expressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1164)|
| 0:19:29| I guess my preference would be we've been operating without a charter for almost a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1169)|
| 0:19:34| and it makes it very difficult when our responsibilities, duties, authority is not clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1174)|
| 0:19:41| And so I would ask the body to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1181)|
| 0:19:44| One of the things that is discussed is that we will revisit the charter yearly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1184)|
| 0:19:51| And at least speaking for myself, and Commissioner Wright and Commissioner Saunders can speak if they disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1191)|
| 0:19:58| I can't speak for Ms. Kaiser or Commissioner Shouse, but I'd be very surprised if they disagreed with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1198)|
| 0:20:04| I've already told Chief Rubel that I'm happy, as I'm sure the other members of the committee are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1204)|
| 0:20:10| to work with him as it relates to the concerns in the domain that you've just expressed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1210)|
| 0:20:15| which I think is where his concern lies, and work with the other members of commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1215)|
| 0:20:21| You came to our last meeting, and we treated you as a member of the group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1221)|
| 0:20:26| And work on language in that one spot that is responsive to concerns that people have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1226)|
| 0:20:36| if that's where the concerns are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1236)|
| 0:20:38| It's a long document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1238)|
| 0:20:39| It's a four-page document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1239)|
| 0:20:40| And if that's the one spot where there's concerns, as I said, if it wasn't for the state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1240)|
| 0:20:45| we wouldn't even have that in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1245)|
| 0:20:47| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1247)|
| 0:20:48| Well, if we could do that, I mean, I know you just gave me your assurance to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1248)|
| 0:20:53| but if we could do that and have some kind of parameters where I feel that people were safe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1253)|
| 0:20:59| and out of harm's way in the sense of what can be done with an audit, and you know that better than I do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1259)|
| 0:21:05| but from a legal standpoint, we know what can be done with audits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1265)|
| 0:21:08| So I will support this as long as I know this is going to be improved upon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1268)|
| 0:21:15| I'll commit to you that we'll put it on our November agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1275)|
| 0:21:19| and I would ask those members of commission and Chief Rubel, where they have concerns as it relates to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1279)|
| 0:21:26| and I don't want to reopen the whole document, but as it relates to that one particular issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1286)|
| 0:21:32| to share those concerns with me, and I'll share it with the other members of the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1292)|
| 0:21:36| We'll discuss it in our meeting of the first Tuesday in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1296)|
| 0:21:40| And, again, all of you are invited to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1300)|
| 0:21:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1303)|
| 0:21:44| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1304)|
| 0:21:46| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1306)|
| 0:21:51| I'll be the first to admit that most of this stuff is way over my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1311)|
| 0:21:55| I run a used car lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1315)|
| 0:21:56| My accounting is a shoebox, and anybody is welcome to audit at any time they'd like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1316)|
| 0:22:04| And, you know, I believe we need this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1324)|
| 0:22:11| But the way the charter is written, it's too broad-based.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1331)|
| 0:22:15| It gives this group entirely too much power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1335)|
| 0:22:18| I'm going to say almost exactly the same thing I said when we formed the ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1338)|
| 0:22:25| You know, when we formed the ethics committee, I thought it was supposed to be all about gifts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1345)|
| 0:22:32| and, you know, whether somebody's accepted something that was worth more than $35 or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1352)|
| 0:22:40| And it's turned into a grand jury.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1360)|
| 0:22:43| I warned them that when you start a group and you empower them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1363)|
| 0:22:47| but you don't give them parameters to stay within, that history has shown us that some pretty ugly things happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1367)|
| 0:22:55| I believe that right now with the folks that we have on the audit committee, I think we're fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1375)|
| 0:23:01| I believe that at this point in the history of Knox County, we're fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1381)|
| 0:23:06| We're not as fractionalized and factionalized as we were a few years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1386)|
| 0:23:14| But the decisions that we make today are going to affect Knox County for a very long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1394)|
| 0:23:21| And if we make the decision to create yet again a well-meaning committee with good folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1401)|
| 0:23:29| but not give them any parameters, it has the potential that this could be used as a political tool at some point in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1409)|
| 0:23:38| And they've said that this, of course, can be fixed if something gets out of hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1418)|
| 0:23:43| We had a vote last month about whether we should limit the power of the ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1423)|
| 0:23:50| I refused to vote to limit the power of the ethics committee last month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1430)|
| 0:23:54| because one of our own folks was about to have an inquisitionary inquiry before the ethics committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1434)|
| 0:24:01| and it would have looked like we were trying to protect one of our own members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1441)|
| 0:24:06| It's hard to fix things when you're in the midst of a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1446)|
| 0:24:12| That's why we need to fix things from the very start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1452)|
| 0:24:15| We need to make sure that we do things right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1455)|
| 0:24:17| One big difference between the ethics committee and the audit committee is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1457)|
| 0:24:24| different departments of county government are represented in the ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1464)|
| 0:24:29| Other departments of county government are not represented in the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1469)|
| 0:24:33| There's not a member from the sheriff's department on the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1473)|
| 0:24:37| And my fear is that as well-meaning as folks are today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1477)|
| 0:24:41| and as much as I support our members today, that it may not be the same in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1481)|
| 0:24:47| and my three minutes is up, so I'm going to stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1487)|
| 0:24:52| Commissioner Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1492)|
| 0:24:55| Chief Rubel, if you don't care to come forward, I've just got one question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1495)|
| 0:24:59| The wording that you and I spoke of earlier, and we talked about the political audit request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1499)|
| 0:25:08| and now understanding that there's a state law, we have to word it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1508)|
| 0:25:14| Is there any other concern you have with the document?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1514)|
| 0:25:18| My problem, as I recall you and I talked about, was the idea that somebody could come in anonymously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1518)|
| 0:25:25| and time it in such a way that it can be politically handled or politically damaging to somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1525)|
| 0:25:29| That is a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1529)|
| 0:25:31| Nothing about the state law limits that concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1531)|
| 0:25:35| What we're asking for is procedures that allow you to limit that concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1535)|
| 0:25:38| And one of the things I would point out is just some of the things we've talked about here today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1538)|
| 0:25:42| is exactly what I was talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1542)|
| 0:25:44| You heard Commissioner Wright, who I want to make sure I'm quoting him right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1544)|
| 0:25:48| he makes a comment that he was in the audit committee when there was an anonymous complaint that was discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1548)|
| 0:25:53| And I believe your phrase is, that's to be handled in the big room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1553)|
| 0:25:56| Was that the way you put it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1556)|
| 0:25:58| That's the kind of procedure that I'm looking for, and it doesn't take that much time to put it in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1558)|
| 0:26:02| If that's going to be the way the audit committee handles it, that's a wonderful thing to put it in the document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1562)|
| 0:26:08| That's all I'm talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1568)|
| 0:26:10| You had Mr. Cosello, and before I go any further, and I think we got a little bit off the beam,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1570)|
| 0:26:15| the sheriff's office is not in any way questioning the need for the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1575)|
| 0:26:19| We are not opposing the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1579)|
| 0:26:21| We are not challenging the integrity of the commissioners on the audit committee or the civilian members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1581)|
| 0:26:26| They are doing a wonderful job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1586)|
| 0:26:27| They're doing it for free, and we appreciate them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1587)|
| 0:26:29| All we're looking for is procedures to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1589)|
| 0:26:32| And Mr. Cosello's comment was that he will investigate these kind of either anonymous or non-anonymous,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1592)|
| 0:26:38| pursuant to your question, if there is credible evidence of a material misstatement and there is a unanimous vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1598)|
| 0:26:45| Those are the procedures that I'm looking for that we need in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1605)|
| 0:26:49| That's exactly what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1609)|
| 0:26:51| I would feel a whole lot better if that was in this document and not stated from this podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1611)|
| 0:26:56| Now, he and I have had a conversation that we can meet it later, that we can meet, we can fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1616)|
| 0:27:00| Clearly, this is a document that you all can create.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1620)|
| 0:27:03| But my problem, and go back to what Mr. King said earlier, I am not a believer, and to agree with Commissioner Lambert,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1623)|
| 0:27:10| I am not a believer in pass it now, create it now, and fix it later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1630)|
| 0:27:14| That is not something that I like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1634)|
| 0:27:17| We have another commission meeting in 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1637)|
| 0:27:20| These issues can be worked out, I am quite confident,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1640)|
| 0:27:24| with people of reasonable minds sitting together in a meeting to say, look, this is what we're afraid of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1644)|
| 0:27:30| I believe Mr. Carsello is receptive to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1650)|
| 0:27:32| I know the sheriff is receptive to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1652)|
| 0:27:34| I believe the attorneys that have indicated private interest in that would love to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1654)|
| 0:27:40| All we're looking for is a little, not consideration, that sounds childish,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1660)|
| 0:27:45| but a little acknowledgement that procedure and process matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1665)|
| 0:27:50| And in this particular, in the public world we live in, it matters a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1670)|
| 0:27:54| And if we don't have that, the idea that we can create it now and fix it later just does not appeal to me at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1674)|
| 0:28:00| And I hope I answered your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1680)|
| 0:28:02| As a lawyer, I tend to just ramble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1682)|
| 0:28:04| You give me a microphone, I'll just talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1684)|
| 0:28:06| But that's the only issue that you have as looking at it as counsel to the sheriff's department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1686)|
| 0:28:11| It's the only issue with the documents you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1691)|
| 0:28:13| Yes, and I would point out that my issue is exactly the same as yours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1693)|
| 0:28:16| and that is what are you going to do with anonymous tip?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1696)|
| 0:28:19| Who's going to decide how it's handled?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1699)|
| 0:28:21| Where is it going to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1701)|
| 0:28:22| Is it going to go to this commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1702)|
| 0:28:23| Is it not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1703)|
| 0:28:24| And he answered with regard to the anonymity or with regard to both anonymous and non-anonymous tips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1704)|
| 0:28:31| But who is going to authorize this investigation to go forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1711)|
| 0:28:35| What parameters does the investigation have before there's even a call for an audit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1715)|
| 0:28:39| Because you remember there's a double, there's a two-step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1719)|
| 0:28:41| Law enforcement, it's like the preliminary hearing and then the trial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1721)|
| 0:28:44| What you've got is a complaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1724)|
| 0:28:46| Then there's an investigation as to the credibility of the complaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1726)|
| 0:28:49| Then an audit is called for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1729)|
| 0:28:51| Then there's an audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1731)|
| 0:28:52| Then they come to you and ask for money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1732)|
| 0:28:54| What are the parameters in the investigation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1734)|
| 0:28:56| But they could also go to the internal auditor's office and request it, and he'd just do it on his own no matter what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1736)|
| 0:29:01| Exactly right, and I believe that was his answer to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1741)|
| 0:29:04| So, I mean, there's no protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1744)|
| 0:29:07| I mean, so even if we put that protection in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1747)|
| 0:29:09| there's still that possibility of an anonymous person going to the internal audit office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1749)|
| 0:29:13| Not if you tell the audit committee how you want them handled, and that's what the state law gives you the authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1753)|
| 0:29:17| But Richard don't have to come to us and just say, hey, I've got this complaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1757)|
| 0:29:20| I'm going to audit it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1760)|
| 0:29:21| No, but if you tell the audit committee this is how we want you to handle it before you give it to the internal auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1761)|
| 0:29:27| We're not giving it to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1767)|
| 0:29:29| Joe Citizen comes up and files a complaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1769)|
| 0:29:32| Richard can do with it what he wants to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1772)|
| 0:29:35| The procedures of the internal auditor presently, is that what you're trying to speak to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1775)|
| 0:29:39| Even under this charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1779)|
| 0:29:41| They can go to Richard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1781)|
| 0:29:42| Correct me if I'm wrong, Richard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1782)|
| 0:29:44| Joe Citizen can come up there and say, this is happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1784)|
| 0:29:48| I'm requesting an audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1788)|
| 0:29:49| He can bring it to commission or he can instigate the audit on his own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1789)|
| 0:29:53| Correct, John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1793)|
| 0:29:57| Now, in the past, when I would, you know, have complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1797)|
| 0:30:01| Do the rules allow you to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1801)|
| 0:30:03| Well, I'm going to explain it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1803)|
| 0:30:05| In the past, when someone would bring me a complaint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1805)|
| 0:30:08| we would do a preliminary review to see if it was valid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1808)|
| 0:30:12| If it was valid, I would take it to the individually, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1812)|
| 0:30:18| to the two commissioners that had been assigned or at that time, which was the audit committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1818)|
| 0:30:26| and I would make them aware of what I was doing without the necessity of bringing it, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1826)|
| 0:30:31| in front of the public at a commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1831)|
| 0:30:34| You know, currently, I would feel obligated if I did do a preliminary review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1834)|
| 0:30:40| and it seemed that it was going to take, you know, a good amount of time to do the work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1840)|
| 0:30:46| I would feel obligated to bring it to the audit committee now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1846)|
| 0:30:49| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1849)|
| 0:30:50| But you can do a preliminary audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1850)|
| 0:30:53| The fear of everyone is that they'll do a preliminary audit before they do anything, bring it to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1853)|
| 0:30:57| That was the fear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1857)|
| 0:30:58| But they can bring it to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1858)|
| 0:31:00| and you can do that before it goes to the audit committee or the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1860)|
| 0:31:03| And I would discuss that with the audit committee chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1863)|
| 0:31:06| But you can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1866)|
| 0:31:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1867)|
| 0:31:08| I think I understand your question now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1868)|
| 0:31:10| but I would point out that Mr. Walls is an employee of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1870)|
| 0:31:15| If you all choose to change that rule, you can change that rule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1875)|
| 0:31:18| and require him with regard to any complaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1878)|
| 0:31:21| And I believe current law, and that's what I spoke to Mr. Carcello about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1881)|
| 0:31:24| is it requires those kind of complaints to come through the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1884)|
| 0:31:28| So what I'm trying to do is just make sure that this is our process now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1888)|
| 0:31:32| I'm trying to fix this process so that when we have one of these issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1892)|
| 0:31:35| we know how it's going to be handled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1895)|
| 0:31:37| And like I said, when I'm sitting there listening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1897)|
| 0:31:39| and I'm hearing Mr. Wright make a comment about that's the way they handled an anonymous tip,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1899)|
| 0:31:43| is it's got to come to this room, I've got no gripe with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1903)|
| 0:31:46| You have the right under our big charter to call for a special audit any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1906)|
| 0:31:50| So if he brings it to the big room and there are ten votes for an audit, then we go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1910)|
| 0:31:55| If there is an anonymous complaint that there is now a preliminary hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1915)|
| 0:31:59| for lack of a better phrase, and they're doing an evaluation as to the credibility of that evidence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1919)|
| 0:32:05| then I think we can be involved in that and we can probably sign off on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1925)|
| 0:32:08| But my problem is all of this stuff is coming from the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1928)|
| 0:32:11| It's not in the document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1931)|
| 0:32:13| And I want to see it in the document so that we can move forward with this thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1933)|
| 0:32:16| and not be perceived as being anti-audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1936)|
| 0:32:19| We are not anti-audit, anti-audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1939)|
| 0:32:21| Our accounts are public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1941)|
| 0:32:25| They've always been public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1945)|
| 0:32:26| We've passed everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1946)|
| 0:32:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1947)|
| 0:32:28| If I could, Mr. Chairman, just a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1948)|
| 0:32:31| Dr. Carcello, if we put a provision, if we put an amendment to the charter tonight that stated any anonymous complaint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1951)|
| 0:32:45| is investigated by the audit committee and before an audit, you guys do a preliminary investigation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1965)|
| 0:32:53| and then the audit committee gives those findings to the commission if they deem it necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1973)|
| 0:32:58| They vote and push it to the audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1978)|
| 0:33:00| They vote as an audit committee to recommend that the commission order an audit or not order an audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1980)|
| 0:33:07| Would that be sufficient?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1987)|
| 0:33:08| Because I think that would solve the issue tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1988)|
| 0:33:12| Mr. Jarrett, does that comply with state law?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=1992)|
| 0:33:21| The statute is pretty clear on its face in terms of the procedures set forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2001)|
| 0:33:29| So you're saying my amendment doesn't comply with state law?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2009)|
| 0:33:33| If you're saying that, say it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2013)|
| 0:33:35| I don't care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2015)|
| 0:33:36| No, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2016)|
| 0:33:39| Unfortunately, again, this is one of these statutes that under statutory construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2019)|
| 0:33:44| you have to give it its plain meaning because it hasn't been interpreted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2024)|
| 0:33:46| And it basically reads that, you know, the audit committee is tasked with establishing this procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2026)|
| 0:33:54| That's the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2034)|
| 0:33:55| Commissioner Anderson, and I defer to Mr. Jarrett in terms of his legal judgment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2035)|
| 0:34:04| I certainly think in terms of a complaint that would necessitate any kind of outside help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2044)|
| 0:34:10| whether it be outside counsel or an outside accounting firm, that's an obvious situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2050)|
| 0:34:17| where we have to come to you to authorize it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2057)|
| 0:34:20| Where it's a complaint that might be appropriately handled through Richard's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2060)|
| 0:34:26| that's a lot dicier because it may actually really serve commission better for the five of us to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2066)|
| 0:34:34| In many cases, we're going to say there's no substance here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2074)|
| 0:34:38| There's absolutely no substance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2078)|
| 0:34:40| We're not going to do anything with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2080)|
| 0:34:43| But there may be substance enough to ask Richard and his staff to do some preliminary work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2083)|
| 0:34:50| Based on the preliminary work, we may find that there's an issue here that whole commission needs to know about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2090)|
| 0:34:57| But I'm not sure it really serves you for every small issue, many of which may be quite gray,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2097)|
| 0:35:05| to have we can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2105)|
| 0:35:10| I guess my question would be before we start a full-blown audit and it comes, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2110)|
| 0:35:17| this complaint comes before your committee and you guys investigate it and you think it's credible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2117)|
| 0:35:25| before a full-blown audit is investigated, would you, if we could add a provision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2125)|
| 0:35:31| that before an audit commences that you could bring it before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2131)|
| 0:35:36| Well, again, on an external audit, no problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2136)|
| 0:35:38| But on internal audits, unless I'm mistaken, Richard, correct me if I'm wrong here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2138)|
| 0:35:42| I don't believe that all of the audits that have been undertaken have been necessarily approved by commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2142)|
| 0:35:49| before he begins work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2149)|
| 0:35:50| I mean, the reason you have an internal audit function is in many cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2150)|
| 0:35:56| certainly before there was an audit committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2156)|
| 0:35:58| a lot of the judgment was left to Richard and his staff as to what they pursued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2158)|
| 0:36:02| So I don't think you want to get in the business of approving every internal audit before it begins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2162)|
| 0:36:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2170)|
| 0:36:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2171)|
| 0:36:12| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2172)|
| 0:36:14| Well, first I just want to say thank you, Joe, and to the whole committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2174)|
| 0:36:20| because I think we do have a very good, honest and audit committee that I think is working to do what's best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2180)|
| 0:36:27| in everybody's interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2187)|
| 0:36:29| And there seems to be this one little glitch there in terms of anybody just being able to come and do a witch hunt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2189)|
| 0:36:38| And exactly what you said from the podium about the committee may not even see that there's enough evidence there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2198)|
| 0:36:47| to do anything about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2207)|
| 0:36:49| And, therefore, if there is something there, they would bring it to our internal auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2209)|
| 0:36:57| So I'm of the same echoing of Commissioner Armstrong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2217)|
| 0:37:01| and Commissioner Anders on this in terms of your amendment there, Brad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2221)|
| 0:37:06| I just went through this whole thing with the Knox County Insurance Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2226)|
| 0:37:11| Even though everybody knows that that's why a committee is developed is to bring recommendations from things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2231)|
| 0:37:20| still everybody wanted that resolution to say that that insurance committee had the right to make recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2240)|
| 0:37:30| that came before Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2250)|
| 0:37:33| And, therefore, I just feel like before we approve this charter that somehow we've got to have that wording in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2253)|
| 0:37:44| stating that where everybody is comfortable with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2264)|
| 0:37:49| And how do we go about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2269)|
| 0:37:51| I don't know if I can make a motion to defer this for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2271)|
| 0:37:57| And when the next audit committee meeting is that all the commissioners come, express,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2277)|
| 0:38:02| somehow find a way where this can be worded into the charter where everybody is comfortable with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2282)|
| 0:38:10| I think the sheriff would like to address the commission if that's possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2290)|
| 0:38:20| Jimmy Jones, Knox County Sheriff, 400 Main Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2300)|
| 0:38:23| The only question I have is the same question that Commissioner Armstrong and Commissioner Anders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2303)|
| 0:38:28| and now Commissioner Carringer have raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2308)|
| 0:38:31| Why would you as a commission, as the stewards of taxpayers' money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2311)|
| 0:38:35| not want to know before an internal audit happens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2315)|
| 0:38:41| Why would you not want to know that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2321)|
| 0:38:44| You are elected by your constituents to understand what's happening in Knox County government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2324)|
| 0:38:50| You certainly would want to know that, I would think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2330)|
| 0:38:52| and you would certainly want to know the credibility of that before that audit takes place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2332)|
| 0:38:58| Now, I may be out of line in asking that question, but why would you not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2338)|
| 0:39:02| Why would you not want this committee to come to you and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2342)|
| 0:39:07| we're getting ready to conduct an internal audit of an office of the Knox County government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2347)|
| 0:39:13| that you are responsible to our taxpayers for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2353)|
| 0:39:16| Why would you not want that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2356)|
| 0:39:20| May I respond briefly to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2360)|
| 0:39:23| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2363)|
| 0:39:26| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2366)|
| 0:39:28| J.J., the nature of audit often is to, not often, but sometimes, we hope it's not often,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2368)|
| 0:39:37| is if we know something is wrong and we need to find out what that is, an internal audit may occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2377)|
| 0:39:46| Now, those are not common.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2386)|
| 0:39:50| They do happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2390)|
| 0:39:51| But that's the way an internal auditor works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2391)|
| 0:39:54| So sometimes you can say, you know, you're scheduled for an audit in two weeks or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2394)|
| 0:40:00| Sometimes, though, if we think or if the auditor thinks there is something amiss in X department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2400)|
| 0:40:07| he is empowered to go up and investigate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2407)|
| 0:40:11| So that's when you don't want to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2411)|
| 0:40:13| But that's about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2413)|
| 0:40:15| But still, again, I say you all should know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2415)|
| 0:40:19| I mean, I was audited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2419)|
| 0:40:21| The Knox County Sheriff's Office last year was audited more times than Warren Buffett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2421)|
| 0:40:25| I mean, we've been audited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2425)|
| 0:40:28| There is a work schedule that is presented to the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2428)|
| 0:40:32| So we know what the auditor is doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2432)|
| 0:40:34| And that's open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2434)|
| 0:40:35| I mean, anybody can come and look, and it's published.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2435)|
| 0:40:38| So we do know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2438)|
| 0:40:39| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2439)|
| 0:40:40| But still, again, I'm saying, why wouldn't you want to be notified?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2440)|
| 0:40:43| Why wouldn't you want, when an internal audit is getting ready to take place on somebody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2443)|
| 0:40:49| because somebody credible has made a complaint that something is wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2449)|
| 0:40:54| why wouldn't you, as commissioners, want to know that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2454)|
| 0:40:59| Why wouldn't you want somebody to stand up here and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2459)|
| 0:41:01| Jimmy Jones, there's been allegations that Jimmy Jones is stealing money from the detention facility commissary account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2461)|
| 0:41:08| Why wouldn't you want to know that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2468)|
| 0:41:09| Why wouldn't I be given the opportunity to come up here and stand before you and tell you that I wasn't?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2469)|
| 0:41:15| We're talking about transparency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2475)|
| 0:41:17| We're talking about openness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2477)|
| 0:41:19| And it seems like now we're going to create a committee that's going to go do whatever they want to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2479)|
| 0:41:23| and then, well, we may or may not later find out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2483)|
| 0:41:25| And I'm not criticizing anybody on that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2485)|
| 0:41:29| You do a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2489)|
| 0:41:30| Each and every one of you, as commissioners, do a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2490)|
| 0:41:33| And I'm proud to have you as a commission for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2493)|
| 0:41:37| I'm not questioning anything you do, nor am I questioning the chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2497)|
| 0:41:42| I'm saying that we talk and we talk and we talk about open and fair and transparency and honest government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2502)|
| 0:41:49| And now we're going to talk about a committee that can initiate things that nobody finds out, not even the commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2509)|
| 0:41:55| JJ, they do find out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2515)|
| 0:41:56| Anything that's discussed in that committee is public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2516)|
| 0:41:59| It's public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2519)|
| 0:42:00| Now, wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2520)|
| 0:42:01| Let me finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2521)|
| 0:42:02| Let me finish my thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2522)|
| 0:42:03| On those rare occasions when the auditor, and the auditor is doing this now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2523)|
| 0:42:07| he can go and investigate an area without telling us or without telling the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2527)|
| 0:42:12| I mean, that's the way it's always been since day one, since Mr. Wallace came to work here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2532)|
| 0:42:17| So nothing's changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2537)|
| 0:42:18| It is getting more transparent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2538)|
| 0:42:20| That's exactly the whole point here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2540)|
| 0:42:22| But now you have the ability through this charter to make sure that it stays transparent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2542)|
| 0:42:26| And now is when that needs to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2546)|
| 0:42:28| That transparency needs to be done on this charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2548)|
| 0:42:31| And in this issue right now, we have one issue facing us, one issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2551)|
| 0:42:36| And that issue is we need to know, you as a commission, me as an elected official,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2556)|
| 0:42:41| if there is an internal audit at the Knox County Sheriff's Office, at the Knox County Trustee's Office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2561)|
| 0:42:46| wherever that is, you all need to know it and I need to know it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2566)|
| 0:42:51| And it will be on the schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2571)|
| 0:42:52| That's where it is right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2572)|
| 0:42:54| Well, that's not what was just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2574)|
| 0:42:56| But if you look back at the minutes of the audit committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2576)|
| 0:43:00| every time we meet there's a schedule published.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2580)|
| 0:43:03| Commissioner Anders asked the question, could you initiate without anyone knowing on this commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2583)|
| 0:43:10| The answer was, I would inform the chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2590)|
| 0:43:13| Occasionally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2593)|
| 0:43:14| And those are real exceptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2594)|
| 0:43:18| I mean, if there is something amiss, you don't necessarily want to announce you're going to go look at that department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2598)|
| 0:43:25| when you think there is something going wrong and give them a chance to cover it up before you get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2605)|
| 0:43:31| So if the auditor knows that, then there is a responsibility to go uncover that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2611)|
| 0:43:37| I don't think that the ability for them to go and cover up would be there to begin with once it's that far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2617)|
| 0:43:43| I think, as you say, these are very rare occasions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2623)|
| 0:43:46| Why don't we take care of those very rare occasions now with the language in this charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2626)|
| 0:43:51| before we pass it and then have to go back and say, I told you so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2631)|
| 0:43:54| That's all I want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2634)|
| 0:43:56| I'm for audits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2636)|
| 0:43:57| I'm for audits committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2637)|
| 0:43:59| Thank you all for serving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2639)|
| 0:44:01| We need to take care of this language now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2641)|
| 0:44:08| Are you finished, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2648)|
| 0:44:11| Well, I just wanted to restate that, you know, I just went through something like this with the insurance committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2651)|
| 0:44:18| where it is important to have every word on there legally on a charter resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2658)|
| 0:44:28| or whatever we're trying to pass that it states exactly what we intend and what we want to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2668)|
| 0:44:35| So I feel like this is the only big question there that's still out there on this charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2675)|
| 0:44:41| So surely there's a way that everyone can be met on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2681)|
| 0:44:49| I understand and I think they'll work with it, but I do think the wording's got to be in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2689)|
| 0:44:54| That's what the law upholds is to make sure the wording's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2694)|
| 0:44:59| That's what they'll go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2699)|
| 0:45:01| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2701)|
| 0:45:03| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2703)|
| 0:45:05| Although I'm inclined to go ahead and vote for this tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2705)|
| 0:45:08| this is the first time that we've actually really discussed this as a full commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2708)|
| 0:45:15| And what I see are commissioners and other members of the county government have some real questions about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2715)|
| 0:45:25| And I would like to have those answered as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2725)|
| 0:45:28| So I'm going to ask, I'm going to make a substitute motion that we defer this for 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2728)|
| 0:45:35| so that we can have some of these questions addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2735)|
| 0:45:39| But I do want them addressed between now and then because I'm ready to vote for this today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2739)|
| 0:45:44| I was ready to go ahead and vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2744)|
| 0:45:46| But I do want to have those commissioners that do have, I think, legitimate questions about this charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2746)|
| 0:45:58| at least the chance to have them heard one more time since this is the first time we've had a chance to discuss this as a body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2758)|
| 0:46:09| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2769)|
| 0:46:12| Properly moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2772)|
| 0:46:16| Future questions will be on that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2776)|
| 0:46:18| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2778)|
| 0:46:21| Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2781)|
| 0:46:23| I guess my question, with the language, either Mr. Rubel or Sheriff Jones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2783)|
| 0:46:29| you said that the commission should be notified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2789)|
| 0:46:31| Are you concerned that you want commission notified or do you want commission to have approval?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2791)|
| 0:46:38| There is a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2798)|
| 0:46:44| If I could, if I may, the suggested changes that I made to this actual paragraph,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2804)|
| 0:46:50| and just to give you an idea of what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2810)|
| 0:46:53| In the compliance, if you want to read with it, it's there on page five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2813)|
| 0:46:56| established procedures for reporting to county commission the receipt, retention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2816)|
| 0:47:00| and treatment of complaints received regarding accounting, internal accounting controls, and auditing matters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2820)|
| 0:47:05| and the submission by employees of concerns regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2825)|
| 0:47:10| All such complaints shall remain confidential until such time as the commission authorizes their investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2830)|
| 0:47:16| What we're asking for, those are the changes that I suggested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2836)|
| 0:47:20| And my understanding from Mr. Carsello's point of view, and I don't want to speak for him, is that he understood that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2840)|
| 0:47:27| I think he did not agree with that, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2847)|
| 0:47:29| Is that fair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2849)|
| 0:47:30| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2850)|
| 0:47:31| The internal audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2851)|
| 0:47:33| The internal audit, from just reporting to you what he said to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2853)|
| 0:47:36| the internal audit piece he doesn't agree that he wants your approval to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2856)|
| 0:47:40| But those are the kind of procedures and the kind of language that I didn't want to waste your all's time with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2860)|
| 0:47:46| This is very hard for us as wordsmiths to sit here and go through piece by piece and word by word| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2866)|
| 0:47:52| and try to make the changes that we all need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2872)|
| 0:47:54| That's why we asked at the audit committee for a workshop that I heard somebody talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2874)|
| 0:47:58| for the opportunity for those of us that are interested in this to give our suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2878)|
| 0:48:04| And then if we have to go to war, because I think we're fighting a war where there's no war to be fought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2884)|
| 0:48:09| I think if we all just sit down and talk, we can make this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2889)|
| 0:48:13| But it's going to take another month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2893)|
| 0:48:14| And I know you've deferred this thing, and I know it's taken him a year, and I know he wants to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2894)|
| 0:48:18| But we all respect the job that the audit committee is doing, and we want to move it forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2898)|
| 0:48:23| I just want to get it right now, Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2903)|
| 0:48:26| Those are the kind of suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2906)|
| 0:48:27| So I think that was the lawyer answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2907)|
| 0:48:29| The short answer is we want the commission to be the one pursuant to the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2909)|
| 0:48:33| If you go all the way back to our charter, it says you have the right to call for an annual audit, that's state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2913)|
| 0:48:39| and any special audit as approved by the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2919)|
| 0:48:42| That's in the actual charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2922)|
| 0:48:43| And if you tie it back down to that, we have no concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2923)|
| 0:48:46| We want to talk procedures about investigation, but all that stuff is beneath your all's worry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2926)|
| 0:48:51| We can fix that if you give us time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2931)|
| 0:48:53| That's what we're asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2933)|
| 0:48:54| I guess I'm looking to the commissioners on the audit committee, Mr. Wright and Mr. Sanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2934)|
| 0:49:01| Now, this is the only concern that you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2941)|
| 0:49:05| I mean, are we opening up to where we're going to be looking at 15, 20 different things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2945)|
| 0:49:09| or are we just looking at these things that you've just mentioned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2949)|
| 0:49:12| Yeah, this is what we're interested in, and that's the only issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2952)|
| 0:49:15| I would point out that it is a relatively complicated issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2955)|
| 0:49:19| because once you start talking about the taking of complaints and the procedures that you will go through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2959)|
| 0:49:24| it's not something that's easy, but I think it's something that people of reasonable minds can get together on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2964)|
| 0:49:30| I don't think there's going to be much of a fight about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2970)|
| 0:49:32| I really don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2972)|
| 0:49:33| But everything else you're okay with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2973)|
| 0:49:35| Yeah, the existence of the audit committee, the powers of the audit committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2975)|
| 0:49:38| it's the receipt retention and treatment of complaints that I really have some issues with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2978)|
| 0:49:45| Well, let me ask Mr. Carsello, I mean, if it's voted on today and it's voted down, then you're a committee with no charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2985)|
| 0:49:52| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2992)|
| 0:49:53| And so by 30 days and working out, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2993)|
| 0:49:56| they've publicly stated that they just have these one or two issues and they feel like that they can work it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=2996)|
| 0:50:01| Is that acceptable to you folks on the audit committee to work out that language and let us vote on it in November?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3001)|
| 0:50:07| Well, let me make a couple of points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3007)|
| 0:50:09| The first point, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3009)|
| 0:50:10| October, I'm sorry, October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3010)|
| 0:50:12| Part of the problem with the language is the language in the state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3012)|
| 0:50:16| which makes it complicated because for us to unilaterally ignore state law is not simple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3016)|
| 0:50:23| and we need the advice and counsel of the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3023)|
| 0:50:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3026)|
| 0:50:27| Keep in mind that language, Commissioner Hammond, wasn't our language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3027)|
| 0:50:30| It's the state law language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3030)|
| 0:50:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3032)|
| 0:50:33| The second point that I would like to make is that my preference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3033)|
| 0:50:41| and again Commissioner Saunders and Commissioner Wright could speak on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3041)|
| 0:50:45| would be if the concern of the Sheriff's Office is that one aspect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3045)|
| 0:50:52| essentially one bullet point in the compliance section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3052)|
| 0:50:56| We are in the process of still putting that together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3056)|
| 0:50:59| I said we have at our meeting in November the two vendors that are coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3059)|
| 0:51:05| We haven't even done anything yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3065)|
| 0:51:07| We haven't even set up policies and procedures yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3067)|
| 0:51:11| This is still an issue that's evolving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3071)|
| 0:51:14| so I think it would be more appropriate to strike that one bullet point from the charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3074)|
| 0:51:21| and vote on the rest of the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3081)|
| 0:51:24| And then we can work with Mr. Jarrett, work with Mr. Rubel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3084)|
| 0:51:31| work with other members of commission who have an interest in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3091)|
| 0:51:34| and put together language that is responsive to their concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3094)|
| 0:51:39| that still meets the requirements of the state law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3099)|
| 0:51:42| and amend the charter in October or November or December, whatever the case may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3102)|
| 0:51:49| But until we have a hotline in place, this is moot anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3109)|
| 0:51:53| So we could, in your opinion, go ahead and do the charter with the exception,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3113)|
| 0:51:57| take out that section, which would be what, the compliance section?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3117)|
| 0:52:00| I think it was just one bullet in the compliance section, wasn't it, Mike?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3120)|
| 0:52:03| First bullet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3123)|
| 0:52:04| Okay, then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3124)|
| 0:52:07| Yes, the bullet point he's speaking of is the first bullet point that is still in existence under compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3127)|
| 0:52:11| The only two left under compliance then would be review the findings of any examinations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3131)|
| 0:52:16| by regulatory agencies and any auditor observations, which we have no objection to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3136)|
| 0:52:21| and obtain regular updates from management and the county's legal counsel regarding compliance matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3141)|
| 0:52:25| If the second to my motion will agree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3145)|
| 0:52:29| then I'll change my motion to approve the charter except amended with striking that one bullet point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3149)|
| 0:52:37| And, Commissioner Hammond, to answer your question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3157)|
| 0:52:39| I would be okay with just if you as a commission was notified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3159)|
| 0:52:45| That would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3165)|
| 0:52:47| As long as you're notified of what's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3167)|
| 0:52:49| We would be fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3169)|
| 0:52:50| But right now what we're doing is we're going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3170)|
| 0:52:52| Yes, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3172)|
| 0:52:53| The motion is to approve without that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3173)|
| 0:52:55| All the charter except for that one section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3175)|
| 0:52:57| And we're good to go with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3177)|
| 0:52:58| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3178)|
| 0:52:59| We're good to go with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3179)|
| 0:53:00| The second agrees with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3180)|
| 0:53:04| I'll ask for nothing else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3184)|
| 0:53:07| To clarify, to make sure you don't say that one section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3187)|
| 0:53:10| If you want to tell me exactly what section that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3190)|
| 0:53:12| It's the first complete, Joe, you've got it there in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3192)|
| 0:53:15| I gave it to the clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3195)|
| 0:53:17| Yeah, it's the first complete paragraph under the compliance section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3197)|
| 0:53:20| The other two remaining are still there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3200)|
| 0:53:22| My motion is that first complete paragraph.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3202)|
| 0:53:27| That reads, establish procedures for, one, the receipt, retention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3207)|
| 0:53:31| and treatment of complaints received regarding accounting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3211)|
| 0:53:34| internal auditing controls, or auditing matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3214)|
| 0:53:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3217)|
| 0:53:38| Two, the submission by employees of concerns regarding questionable accounting and auditing matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3218)|
| 0:53:45| So we're going to strike that whole bullet point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3225)|
| 0:53:48| But you'll come back to us in October with language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3228)|
| 0:53:50| With the idea that we'll be back in October with agreeable language and procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3230)|
| 0:53:55| On your part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3235)|
| 0:53:56| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3236)|
| 0:53:57| That cut a lot of lights off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3237)|
| 0:53:58| It'll cut them all off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3238)|
| 0:53:59| That should have cut them all off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3239)|
| 0:54:04| I just want to make sure that Dr. Carsello and the members of the audit committee were comfortable with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3244)|
| 0:54:12| I would ask, as a member of the audit committee, that rather than bring it just back to commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3252)|
| 0:54:16| that you bring it to the audit committee and let us recommend it to commission once more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3256)|
| 0:54:20| Yeah, Commissioner Royals, I'm comfortable with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3260)|
| 0:54:23| I think it's probably more important to get the charter approved, hopefully, amazingly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3263)|
| 0:54:28| unanimously possibly, than to have it be a real split vote even if it was to pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3268)|
| 0:54:33| And as I said to this body before, we wouldn't even have had that in there if it wasn't for the state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3273)|
| 0:54:40| And we're really not ready to fully roll that out until we have a hotline in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3280)|
| 0:54:45| So I do think Commissioner Saunders is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3285)|
| 0:54:47| What we should do is work with Mr. Rubel, work with any of the rest of you who have opinions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3287)|
| 0:54:52| work on language to replace that bullet, approve it through the audit committee, FINBAR, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3292)|
| 0:54:58| on the first Tuesday of November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3298)|
| 0:55:00| Because we're not going to be ready to roll the hotline out before then anyway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3300)|
| 0:55:03| and then take it to your county commission meeting in November for hopefully your approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3303)|
| 0:55:08| You mean November or October?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3308)|
| 0:55:10| November. We meet in November 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3310)|
| 0:55:12| They can bring it back whenever they're ready because the motion does not state for them when to bring that back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3312)|
| 0:55:18| So when all parties are ready to bring it back, they can bring it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3318)|
| 0:55:24| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3324)|
| 0:55:26| Mr. Carsello, I have a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3326)|
| 0:55:30| I am not an auditor, don't know anything about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3330)|
| 0:55:33| understand what the sheriff was saying and agree with what he's trying to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3333)|
| 0:55:37| Here's what I'm having a little trouble with, and you'll be thinking about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3337)|
| 0:55:42| To me, a purpose of an audit is to find wrongdoing or find something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3342)|
| 0:55:48| If we come in here and we announce to everybody, here's what we're doing, here's where we're going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3348)|
| 0:55:55| is that going to jeopardize your committee and what you're trying to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3355)|
| 0:55:58| So my question is, do you think this is a good idea to notify everybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3358)|
| 0:56:05| Well, I think this is where I'm hoping that the audit committee working with Mr. Rubel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3365)|
| 0:56:11| working with the commission, can all come to language that we feel good about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3371)|
| 0:56:16| My sense is that Mr. Rubel is reasonable, and I think he's sensitive to that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3376)|
| 0:56:22| What you don't want to do, obviously, is what you pointed out, Commissioner Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3382)|
| 0:56:25| and that's to telegraph what you're looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3385)|
| 0:56:28| I mean, one of the things that's important to understand is any audit that's undertaken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3388)|
| 0:56:33| if it's an external audit, you have to approve it because we don't have any budgetary authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3393)|
| 0:56:38| If it's an internal audit and we work with Richard to do it, in essence, you're approving it anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3398)|
| 0:56:44| You're approving it through Finbar and Ed and Dave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3404)|
| 0:56:48| And so, as Dave has said in a very articulate manner, this committee is you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3408)|
| 0:56:55| It's a subset of you, but it's you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3415)|
| 0:56:58| Mary and I are there simply to provide some technical expertise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3418)|
| 0:57:03| and that really is, in many cases, more on the external audit than the internal audit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3423)|
| 0:57:08| because the external audit gets much more into kind of gap stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3428)|
| 0:57:13| A lot of the internal audit is just common sense, really, some of these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3433)|
| 0:57:17| So if we were to ask Richard's group to look at something, by definition, Dave and Finbar and Ed know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3437)|
| 0:57:25| and my understanding, Finbar, has been that Ed periodically reports to this group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3445)|
| 0:57:32| I thoroughly trust the audit committee and you as being chairperson of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3452)|
| 0:57:36| but I feel if you all need, for some reason, to keep something quiet, that you're checking something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3456)|
| 0:57:43| and then you do find something to come tell us, that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3463)|
| 0:57:46| But I want to protect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3466)|
| 0:57:48| I don't want to compromise anything that you're trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3468)|
| 0:57:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3472)|
| 0:57:53| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3473)|
| 0:57:57| This is sort of a little bit of Commissioner Smith said the audit is to find some wrongdoing or something going wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3477)|
| 0:58:06| Let me disagree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3486)|
| 0:58:07| We're not looking for wrongdoing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3487)|
| 0:58:10| I think the glass is half full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3490)|
| 0:58:12| We're looking for things that are being right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3492)|
| 0:58:14| and only want to suggest improvements for things being done better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3494)|
| 0:58:20| We have a substitute motion on the floor to approve with, you know, as amended, one bully part out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3500)|
| 0:58:28| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3508)|
| 0:58:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3510)|
| 0:58:31| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3511)|
| 0:58:33| Let's have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3513)|
| 0:58:36| 906.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3516)|
| 0:58:38| Can we have a break?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3518)|
| 0:58:42| No, we have some folks like Doc that probably need to get through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3522)|
| 0:58:48| He's been here a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3528)|
| 0:58:49| I mean, he's probably the only non-compensated one that's talked through this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3529)|
| 0:58:55| I'd like to get through that before we break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3535)|
| 0:58:57| It's 906.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3537)|
| 0:58:59| 906 and 911 still potentially could deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3539)|
| 0:59:06| Are we going to go ahead?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3546)|
| 0:59:07| Everyone wants to go ahead with 906 and 911 to get it over with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3547)|
| 0:59:11| 906.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3551)|
| 0:59:15| Consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee expressing the will of the Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3555)|
| 0:59:19| as it relates to the role of the Audit Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3559)|
| 0:59:21| Resolution 906.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3561)|

| 0:59:29| 4-3 to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3569)|
| 0:59:35| I will make a motion that we withdraw since, if that's okay, Commissioner Harmon, since we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3575)|
| 0:59:41| I just had one question for the law director and then I'm pretty well settled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3581)|
| 0:59:46| The internal auditor is always answered to county commission or the chair of the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3586)|
| 0:59:52| What is the state law?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3592)|
| 0:59:54| Can you tell us what the state law is about the internal auditor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3594)|
| 0:59:57| It's silent as to that, sir, but your charter, or I should say more accurately, county code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3597)|
| 1:00:03| reads that he works for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3603)|
| 1:00:05| And the state law doesn't preempt that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3605)|
| 1:00:08| So at this juncture, he works for the 19-member body, Politech.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3608)|
| 1:00:12| And that doesn't change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3612)|
| 1:00:14| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3614)|
| 1:00:16| Do I have a motion to withdraw?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3616)|
| 1:00:18| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3618)|
| 1:00:19| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3619)|
| 1:00:21| Probably moved and seconded that we withdraw 906.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3621)|
| 1:00:24| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3624)|
| 1:00:25| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3625)|
| 1:00:27| Opposed? Say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3627)|
| 1:00:29| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3629)|
| 1:00:31| 911.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3631)|
| 1:00:35| Consideration of a resolution of the commission of Knox County, Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3635)|
| 1:00:39| terminating the contract with Alexander Thompson and Arnold for professional auditing services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3639)|

| 1:01:11| No, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3671)|
| 1:01:13| Governmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3673)|
| 1:01:14| 4-2, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3674)|
| 1:01:16| I make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3676)|
| 1:01:18| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3678)|
| 1:01:22| To approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3682)|
| 1:01:23| No, we don't want to approve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3683)|
| 1:01:29| I don't want to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3689)|
| 1:01:31| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3691)|
| 1:01:32| I don't want to approve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3692)|
| 1:01:33| You're approving it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3693)|
| 1:01:35| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3695)|
| 1:01:36| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3696)|
| 1:01:37| No, I don't mean that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3697)|
| 1:01:39| I withdraw my second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3699)|
| 1:01:40| I told you I needed a break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3700)|
| 1:01:43| You can vote against your own motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3703)|
| 1:01:45| I make a motion that we deny 911.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3705)|
| 1:01:48| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3708)|
| 1:01:51| The motion on the floor to deny 911, Commissioner Flanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3711)|
| 1:01:56| Probably moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3716)|
| 1:01:57| And seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3717)|
| 1:01:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3718)|
| 1:01:59| We do have, once again, two speakers here, three actually, Dr. Carsello, Mike Reeves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3719)|
| 1:02:06| and Mike Hewitt from ATA that I think are going to want to address this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3726)|
| 1:02:12| And I know all the commissioners got this memo from Joe Carsello responding to many of the concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3732)|
| 1:02:21| that Mr. Walls expressed at both of our committee meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3741)|
| 1:02:28| And I don't know if we want to go over that point by point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3748)|
| 1:02:32| I'd rather not unless people have questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3752)|
| 1:02:34| I mean, it's a long memo, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3754)|
| 1:02:35| I mean, we've already been here a long time, and you have other business to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3755)|
| 1:02:41| But, I mean, I prepared as detailed a memo as I could for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3761)|
| 1:02:44| I'm happy to respond to any of the questions that you may have about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3764)|
| 1:02:49| Let me just maybe try to give a very quick overview, if I could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3769)|
| 1:02:53| for those of you who have not had a chance to spend as much time with the memo as you may want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3773)|
| 1:02:57| The charter that establishes the internal audit function requires that the function comply with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3777)|
| 1:03:04| generally accepted government auditing standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3784)|
| 1:03:07| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3787)|
| 1:03:08| It's pretty clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3788)|
| 1:03:09| It's black and white.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3789)|
| 1:03:10| It's not ambiguous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3790)|
| 1:03:11| Generally accepted government auditing standards require that an external review be done once every three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3791)|
| 1:03:18| Again, that's not ambiguous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3798)|
| 1:03:20| I mean, it's a sentence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3800)|
| 1:03:22| I mean, we could have a third grader read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3802)|
| 1:03:24| There's no ambiguity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3804)|
| 1:03:26| There has not been a peer review in about eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3806)|
| 1:03:31| Why that's the case, it was way before my time, so I'm not going to pass any judgment on why that's the case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3811)|
| 1:03:36| but there hasn't been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3816)|
| 1:03:38| So it became pretty clear that we needed to have a peer review done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3818)|
| 1:03:43| My preference, because there's clearly tension between certain elements within the county government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3823)|
| 1:03:53| and the internal auditor, and my preference was to have a very well-known firm do this work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3833)|
| 1:04:01| and a firm that was not anywhere close to Knox County so that it would be completely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3841)|
| 1:04:07| as best we could get it, completely independent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3847)|
| 1:04:11| Mr. Reeves has a database of a number of firms on that database that he sent the RFP to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3851)|
| 1:04:18| We worked with purchasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3858)|
| 1:04:20| We worked with the law department to develop the RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3860)|
| 1:04:23| I called and gave Mr. Reeves telephone numbers and e-mail addresses of partners in major firms in Atlanta| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3863)|
| 1:04:33| and in Nashville, and I was hoping that they may participate in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3873)|
| 1:04:40| We got three bids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3880)|
| 1:04:43| One of the bids, and the audit committee does not control who wants to do business with Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3883)|
| 1:04:50| but I will tell you, people, it is a small subset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3890)|
| 1:04:56| Small digression, but I think you need to know this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3896)|
| 1:05:00| I had lunch last week with a very senior partner at a Big Four firm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3900)|
| 1:05:04| and this partner told me that his firm's profits per partner are down between 10% and 20%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3904)|
| 1:05:11| That's a significant decline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3911)|
| 1:05:14| I asked him about interest in working with Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3914)|
| 1:05:17| He said his firm would not touch Knox County with a 10-foot pole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3917)|
| 1:05:22| That's the reputation that's out there right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3922)|
| 1:05:25| So we had three bids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3925)|
| 1:05:28| One of the bids was clearly not qualified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3928)|
| 1:05:31| There was issues even with the licensing of the firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3931)|
| 1:05:35| There were two bids left, one by ATA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3935)|
| 1:05:38| and one essentially a team that was put together by the Institute of Internal Auditors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3938)|
| 1:05:43| They were both very credible bids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3943)|
| 1:05:45| I don't know which one we would have recommended candidly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3945)|
| 1:05:48| There was concern on the part of individuals in the mayor's office that the IIA bid might not be independent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3948)|
| 1:05:57| I didn't personally share that concern, but that wasn't my judgment to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3957)|
| 1:06:02| They went to the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3962)|
| 1:06:05| They asked the law department how they should address that concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3965)|
| 1:06:09| The law department said, put your concern in writing and give it to us, and we will issue an opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3969)|
| 1:06:15| They did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3975)|
| 1:06:17| The law department concluded that although there was probably not a threat to independence in fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3977)|
| 1:06:25| there was a threat to the appearance of independence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3985)|
| 1:06:29| Again, this was not a decision the audit committee made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3989)|
| 1:06:32| We were not asked for our opinion on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3992)|
| 1:06:34| We were told this, and we were told not to consider the IIA bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=3994)|
| 1:06:41| So we didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4001)|
| 1:06:43| We had a bid left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4003)|
| 1:06:45| We had a bid from ATA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4005)|
| 1:06:46| I'll let Mr. Hewitt speak for his firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4006)|
| 1:06:48| But ATA is a very well-respected firm in Jackson, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4008)|
| 1:06:52| It's been in business for over 60 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4012)|
| 1:06:55| It's one of the largest CPA firms in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4015)|
| 1:06:58| The individuals they proposed to put on the engagement were two partners and a senior manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4018)|
| 1:07:04| If you know anything at all about public accounting, putting two partners and a senior manager on an engagement is very unusual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4024)|
| 1:07:11| I mean, most auditing work is done by low-level staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4031)|
| 1:07:14| It's not done by partners and senior managers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4034)|
| 1:07:17| So that was very unusual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4037)|
| 1:07:18| I think as a committee we were all very impressed with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4038)|
| 1:07:21| The individuals who were put on the engagement had either very extensive experience in governmental auditing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4041)|
| 1:07:27| or very extensive experience in the peer review process, both of which are germane to what we're talking about here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4047)|
| 1:07:34| We were told that ATA had followed all of the necessary requirements as it relates to Knox County Purchasing Code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4054)|
| 1:07:42| They clearly, in our opinion, clearly qualified to do the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4062)|
| 1:07:46| And so we recommended them to commission unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4066)|
| 1:07:50| It really wasn't even that controversial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4070)|
| 1:07:52| The only real controversy, and this will come up, so I'll just address it straight on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4072)|
| 1:07:58| The only controversy was, at least in our view at the time, was there were three references listed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4078)|
| 1:08:05| One of the references listed was Rota for Moss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4085)|
| 1:08:09| I saw that when I was going through the bid, way before Richard raised any concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4089)|
| 1:08:16| And I raised the issue in an audit committee meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4096)|
| 1:08:19| And you start thinking, you're around Knox County too long, you start thinking paranoid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4099)|
| 1:08:25| And so I said, well, I guess it's conceivable that someone in the mayor's office called someone at Rota for Moss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4105)|
| 1:08:34| and said, do you know a CPA firm in the state of Tennessee that might bid on this work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4114)|
| 1:08:39| Let's get Richard Walls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4119)|
| 1:08:41| Now, I think it's a massive assumption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4121)|
| 1:08:44| Talk about economists with assumptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4124)|
| 1:08:46| This would put them to shame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4126)|
| 1:08:48| So I think it's a massive assumption there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4128)|
| 1:08:51| And as Commissioner Shouse pointed out, and I think Commissioner Shouse was dead on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4131)|
| 1:08:55| he said if, in fact, that had gone on, not only are they essentially crooks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4135)|
| 1:09:00| but they're amazingly stupid crooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4140)|
| 1:09:03| Because if you had done that, why in the world would you list Rota for Moss as a reference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4143)|
| 1:09:08| You'd have to be amazingly dumb to have done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4148)|
| 1:09:11| But in an overabundance of caution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4151)|
| 1:09:15| In an overabundance of caution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4155)|
| 1:09:17| And some of you were there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4157)|
| 1:09:19| We had Mr. Hewitt come to Knox County in early May,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4159)|
| 1:09:23| and we gave him a grilling that would make the Supreme Court justices proud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4163)|
| 1:09:29| We put that man through a grilling that really was probably inappropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4169)|
| 1:09:33| since he and his firm had done nothing wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4173)|
| 1:09:36| But we put him through an extensive grilling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4176)|
| 1:09:39| To be even more cautious, and Mr. Jarrett may remember this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4179)|
| 1:09:45| we had the law department draft a memo that stated that everything that Mr. Hewitt stated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4185)|
| 1:09:52| was a true statement and that there were no ties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4192)|
| 1:09:56| as it relates to Mr. Walls and the mayor's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4196)|
| 1:09:59| and any conversation between his firm and Mr. Walls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4199)|
| 1:10:04| not Mr. Walls, any ties between his firm and the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4204)|
| 1:10:08| I wrote a remorse related to this work that he had to sign an affidavit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4208)|
| 1:10:13| on the penalties of criminal perjury.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4213)|
| 1:10:20| So if he's lying, I guess he's running the risk that he wants to go to prison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4220)|
| 1:10:25| Now, I don't know what more we could have done as a group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4225)|
| 1:10:31| to bend over backwards to do everything reasonably possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4231)|
| 1:10:36| to make this process as fair and as objective as humanly possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4236)|
| 1:10:43| And so that's what we've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4243)|
| 1:10:45| So, again, Mr. Hewitt is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4245)|
| 1:10:48| Mike Reeves is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4248)|
| 1:10:49| I'm sure they'll talk, Finbar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4249)|
| 1:10:52| But let me at least give the opportunity of commissioners to ask me whatever questions they want to ask me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4252)|
| 1:11:02| I don't even know who's next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4262)|
| 1:11:03| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4263)|
| 1:11:05| I do not have a problem with Mr. Hewitt's firm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4265)|
| 1:11:08| and I appreciate the fact that he and his firm want to do business with Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4268)|
| 1:11:12| the fact that they're in Jackson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4272)|
| 1:11:13| and the fact that they're going to put their senior partners here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4273)|
| 1:11:16| When you look at their credentials, Mr. Hewitt is very impressive, also Mr. Sparks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4276)|
| 1:11:21| You see that he is the past chairperson of the peer review committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4281)|
| 1:11:25| We got a document today from Mr. Reeves talking about their background in performing audits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4285)|
| 1:11:30| governmental type audits and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4290)|
| 1:11:33| I think they'll do an outstanding job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4293)|
| 1:11:35| I guess the other question that I have for our law director is, Mr. Law Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4295)|
| 1:11:40| we have a contract that has been properly executed that has been voted on by this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4300)|
| 1:11:47| I assume it's been signed by the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4307)|
| 1:11:49| Has it been signed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4309)|
| 1:11:51| So we have a signed contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4311)|
| 1:11:53| Now, if we come in now and say, all right, we don't want this contract anymore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4313)|
| 1:11:58| aren't we putting ourselves at risk to having to pay the contract because it's been executed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4318)|
| 1:12:02| and do we not risk or is there a possibility of interference with a contractual arrangement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4322)|
| 1:12:08| I'm looking to you to give me some guidance on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4328)|
| 1:12:10| Well, sir, you'd be a material breach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4330)|
| 1:12:12| and I would presume that the firm would then sue for what's known as specific performance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4332)|
| 1:12:17| which means the value of the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4337)|
| 1:12:19| When we voted on this, I don't recall anyone stepping forward and saying, no, don't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4339)|
| 1:12:25| I don't recall anyone coming forward and saying, this is not a good contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4345)|
| 1:12:30| It's not a good company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4350)|
| 1:12:31| The audit committee gave us their recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4351)|
| 1:12:35| We thought it was a good recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4355)|
| 1:12:37| I still think it's a good recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4357)|
| 1:12:39| So I think we need to move ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4359)|
| 1:12:42| Now, I guess the question that I have, and I'm a bottom line kind of guy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4362)|
| 1:12:48| our internal auditor has said or has to this point not cooperated with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4368)|
| 1:12:58| We need our internal auditor to cooperate with this peer review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4378)|
| 1:13:01| What do we need to do as a commission, since he is our employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4381)|
| 1:13:05| to make sure that we're getting cooperation and I'm all for this peer review moving forward as quickly as possible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4385)|
| 1:13:12| And the reason I think it's important that it move forward is we're not out to get anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4392)|
| 1:13:16| We're out to look at procedures and see how we can improve this office so that it can function properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4396)|
| 1:13:24| It's a fair question, Commissioner Hammond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4404)|
| 1:13:27| and it's one that has created a lot of difficulty for our audit committee over the last three months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4407)|
| 1:13:32| One of the reasons I really felt it was important for the charter to be passed tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4412)|
| 1:13:37| But Mr. Walz is a commission employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4417)|
| 1:13:41| At most, what the audit committee can do would be to make a recommendation to you as it relates to his work product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4421)|
| 1:13:50| I think at this point we don't want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4430)|
| 1:13:53| At our last meeting, we had voted to try to talk to Richard to encourage him to participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4433)|
| 1:14:03| I believe I made three telephone calls to him and sent one e-mail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4443)|
| 1:14:08| and none of those attempts at outreach were returned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4448)|
| 1:14:13| Mr. Jarrett made, I believe, either a phone call or an e-mail, an attempt at outreach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4453)|
| 1:14:19| That wasn't returned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4459)|
| 1:14:21| Candidly, we have a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4461)|
| 1:14:25| If you have an audit committee that you've put in place, I think it's a solid group of five people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4465)|
| 1:14:33| I'll leave myself out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4473)|
| 1:14:34| A solid group of four people, and you can make a judgment about me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4474)|
| 1:14:40| And if we don't have an ongoing dialogue with the director of internal audit, it's very problematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4480)|
| 1:14:46| Mr. Walz is here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4486)|
| 1:14:47| My hope would be that he would say, you know, I'm willing to move forward in a cooperative way with ATA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4487)|
| 1:14:54| and I'm willing to move forward in a cooperative way with the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4494)|
| 1:14:58| I think that would greatly truncate this conversation and make life much better for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4498)|
| 1:15:05| If he's not willing to do that, I guess the direct answer to your question, Commissioner Hammond, would be, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4505)|
| 1:15:12| the commission, since he is an employee of this body, would need to initiate a resolution that would be seconded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4512)|
| 1:15:23| that would direct Mr. Walz to give his full and complete and unconditional cooperation to ATA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4523)|
| 1:15:32| and assuming that motion passes, then hopefully Mr. Walz will follow that direction of his employer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4532)|
| 1:15:42| If he chooses not to follow that direction, the audit committee will report back to you to that effect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4542)|
| 1:15:47| and then you'll have to take whatever action you deem is appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4547)|
| 1:15:51| September 3rd, we have a letter that Mr. Jarrett has sent to Mr. Walz,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4551)|
| 1:15:55| and I don't want to talk about him like he's not in the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4555)|
| 1:15:57| I'm going to ask a direct question to Richard here in just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4557)|
| 1:16:00| To Mr. Hewitt, thank you for taking time to come all the way from Jackson for a second time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4560)|
| 1:16:05| The fact that you were willing to sign a criminal perjury statement, thank you for doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4565)|
| 1:16:11| Most people would have looked at that and said, hey, we've been in business 60 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4571)|
| 1:16:15| We don't need this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4575)|
| 1:16:17| But you have persevered, and thank you for working through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4577)|
| 1:16:20| I can tell that you've done governmental work before because you understand the political nature of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4580)|
| 1:16:24| So, Richard, if this passes, do you intend to cooperate with this peer review?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4584)|
| 1:16:29| I'd like to make my statement first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4589)|
| 1:16:31| Yes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4591)|
| 1:16:34| This resolution is appropriately numbered 9-1-1, and I'm calling for your help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4594)|
| 1:16:44| Resolution 9-1-1 is about selecting and approving an appropriate external review team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4604)|
| 1:16:53| It has nothing to do with whether or not a peer review is needed or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4613)|
| 1:16:58| It has nothing to do with whether a peer review has been performed or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4618)|
| 1:17:04| It's all about doing the right thing, doing it the right way, and selecting the appropriate peer review team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4624)|
| 1:17:14| We need to engage a peer review team that has performed a yellow book peer review of a local government audit group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4634)|
| 1:17:24| one that's done it before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4644)|
| 1:17:27| We need a qualified peer review team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4647)|
| 1:17:30| We need a peer review team that has no hint of conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4650)|
| 1:17:36| As I shared with the finance and in governmental committees, I've been in this business 35 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4656)|
| 1:17:44| I've worked in internal auditing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4664)|
| 1:17:46| I've worked in public accounting as an audit manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4666)|
| 1:17:50| I've worked as a controller in the corporate world where I worked with external auditors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4670)|
| 1:17:56| And without hesitation, I can tell you each of the disciplines are different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4676)|
| 1:18:01| and have a unique professional organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4681)|
| 1:18:04| They have unique training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4684)|
| 1:18:06| They have unique certifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4686)|
| 1:18:09| When I started as county auditor in 2001, I'd already possessed a CPA certificate for close to 25 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4689)|
| 1:18:19| but I quickly found the need for additional training, an internal auditing certification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4699)|
| 1:18:26| The audit process, the methodology, the reporting were much different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4706)|
| 1:18:33| I started the process and my staff auditor and I obtained the certified internal auditor designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4713)|
| 1:18:42| ATA is probably a good firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4722)|
| 1:18:44| They really are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4724)|
| 1:18:45| Mike Hewitt is probably a great guy, a great auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4725)|
| 1:18:49| However, they're an external public accounting firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4729)|
| 1:18:56| They're not a government internal audit group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4736)|
| 1:18:59| They're not our peer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4739)|
| 1:19:04| They don't have the relevant certifications or memberships and professional organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4744)|
| 1:19:10| The best I can tell, they've never, ever performed a yellow book,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4750)|
| 1:19:15| peer review of a local government internal audit group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4755)|
| 1:19:19| There's only around six of us in the whole state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4759)|
| 1:19:24| and I've communicated with every one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4764)|
| 1:19:31| They have known affiliations and professional relationships with Rota for Moss,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4771)|
| 1:19:36| and I have a concern with that still to this day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4776)|
| 1:19:41| In an attempt to move forward in the spirit of compromise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4781)|
| 1:19:46| I'm willing to withdraw the 202H request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4786)|
| 1:19:56| What I'm suggesting is that the external peer review be done by the Association of Local Government Auditors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4796)|
| 1:20:05| who are my peer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4805)|
| 1:20:08| The cost to the county should be less than $5,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4808)|
| 1:20:13| because in the IIA world, in the internal auditing world, in the government auditing world,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4813)|
| 1:20:18| you give back to the profession.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4818)|
| 1:20:21| It's a volunteer service that you perform peer reviews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4821)|
| 1:20:25| Travel is really the only expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4825)|
| 1:20:30| We've looked at government audit groups all across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4830)|
| 1:20:34| Not all have had peer reviews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4834)|
| 1:20:38| Of those that had, 90 to 95% of them used the Association of Local Government Auditors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4838)|
| 1:20:46| None, we saw none that used a public accounting firm to do a peer review, because they're not our peers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4846)|
| 1:20:55| It's understandable why public accounting firms did not respond to this RFP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4855)|
| 1:21:00| because they're not our peer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4860)|
| 1:21:04| All I'm asking you to do is do the right thing and do it the right way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4864)|
| 1:21:08| I feel like my office and the taxpayers deserve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4868)|
| 1:21:14| Thank you for your comment and your statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4874)|
| 1:21:18| You have given us what you feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4878)|
| 1:21:22| I would point out again that when this contract was approved, there was no red flags raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4882)|
| 1:21:27| There were no statements issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4887)|
| 1:21:29| There was nothing that came before commission when the contract was approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4889)|
| 1:21:33| We have a legally binding contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4893)|
| 1:21:35| All of the information that we have received shows, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4895)|
| 1:21:39| that these folks can conduct the survey and that they can do it properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4899)|
| 1:21:43| Now, I guess my question is, if this body, and I don't know what the body is going to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4903)|
| 1:21:47| but if the body chooses to go ahead with Hewitt, will you cooperate with the peer review?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4907)|
| 1:21:53| I think I would have to wait and see what happens to give you my answer then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4913)|
| 1:21:58| So I guess you're saying that if we do, there's a possibility that you will not cooperate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4918)|
| 1:22:05| I didn't say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4925)|
| 1:22:06| But there is that possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4926)|
| 1:22:08| You said you'd have to wait and see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4928)|
| 1:22:09| I didn't say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4929)|
| 1:22:11| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4931)|
| 1:22:15| Commissioner Lupo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4935)|
| 1:22:17| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4937)|
| 1:22:19| Is it Mr. Hewitt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4939)|
| 1:22:21| Mr. Hewitt, could you come up to the podium, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4941)|
| 1:22:28| Mike Hewitt, 227 Orwell Road, Jackson, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4948)|
| 1:22:32| Mr. Hewitt, I appreciate you coming all the way from Jackson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4952)|
| 1:22:37| I know it's not next door, but I appreciate you being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4957)|
| 1:22:43| My question to you is, given the situation we have here with Richard Walls and his statement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4963)|
| 1:22:56| and the fact that he has not up to this point cooperated with your firm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4976)|
| 1:23:04| will that bias your audit in any way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4984)|
| 1:23:12| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4992)|
| 1:23:13| I've been doing work in the governmental environment for my entire career, 31 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=4993)|
| 1:23:20| I typically examine people who don't want me there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5000)|
| 1:23:25| Nobody likes an audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5005)|
| 1:23:28| We try to change that perception, but nobody typically likes it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5008)|
| 1:23:32| It's not their preference of what they want to have done when they get up in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5012)|
| 1:23:38| So working in a, for lack of a better term, an adversarial environment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5018)|
| 1:23:44| is something that governmental auditors are used to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5024)|
| 1:23:48| That is a large segment of our practice in the governmental arena, so we're used to dealing with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5028)|
| 1:23:57| We go out of our way to make sure that does not impact our professional opinion, and sometimes that's difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5037)|
| 1:24:06| There's a threshold that you cross over because the hallmark of an auditor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5046)|
| 1:24:13| and these are audit services, so to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5053)|
| 1:24:16| because I will give an opinion on the internal audit operation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5056)|
| 1:24:20| and its compliance with its quality control standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5060)|
| 1:24:27| The hallmark of that is objectivity and independence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5067)|
| 1:24:31| Once you're not objective anymore, then you have to quit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5071)|
| 1:24:34| You have to resign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5074)|
| 1:24:36| To answer your question, yes, we're still objective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5076)|
| 1:24:39| How long do you think it would take for you to complete this audit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5079)|
| 1:24:43| We had budgeted 120 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5083)|
| 1:24:47| I've already spent more time than I wish I'd had on discussions like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5087)|
| 1:24:53| that have not advanced us one iota in getting the audit done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5093)|
| 1:24:58| I still think we can come in close to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5098)|
| 1:25:02| I'm not sure, though, because the amount of time I've had to spend on issues like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5102)|
| 1:25:07| I know that's 120 hours billable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5107)|
| 1:25:11| But, I mean, once you start, I mean, do you think you'll be done in a week, two weeks, a month, two months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5111)|
| 1:25:17| I mean, when would we expect to see a report back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5117)|
| 1:25:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5120)|
| 1:25:21| The process involves asking Mr. Walls to fill out some questionnaires,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5121)|
| 1:25:27| give us some information that we can evaluate as far as his quality control system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5127)|
| 1:25:33| the engagements or the audits that he's done over the three-year period that we've been engaged to look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5133)|
| 1:25:40| and then coming back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5140)|
| 1:25:42| And that will take some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5142)|
| 1:25:43| He'll have to have time to compile that information and forward it to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5143)|
| 1:25:47| I'll have to have time to digest it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5147)|
| 1:25:49| And then we come back and we begin our field work portion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5149)|
| 1:25:52| which involves looking at some engagements, looking at the documentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5152)|
| 1:25:58| looking at the files that support the training and education of the internal audit staff, and several other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5158)|
| 1:26:09| At that point, you know, this is not a complicated process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5169)|
| 1:26:13| I mean, at that point we will be ready to issue a report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5173)|
| 1:26:16| and meet with Mr. Walls and the audit committee to go over that report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5176)|
| 1:26:24| If we can get the go-ahead to start tomorrow, I foresee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5184)|
| 1:26:28| and the difficulty we have is I had this scheduled back in June,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5188)|
| 1:26:32| and the people on the team I've got now, and then we had a schedule in August,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5192)|
| 1:26:38| and I just couldn't keep rescheduling them, so I've got to try to schedule them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5198)|
| 1:26:42| So it may take six to eight weeks to get this done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5202)|
| 1:26:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5204)|
| 1:26:47| How familiar are you with what Richard has said, the Yellow Book procedures?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5207)|
| 1:26:58| For those of you who don't know what all the colors are we're referring to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5218)|
| 1:27:01| the governmental auditing standards is the publication that was put out by the GAO| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5221)|
| 1:27:08| that defines how governmental audits are done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5228)|
| 1:27:11| In the state of Tennessee, for what I do most of the time, which is external auditing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5231)|
| 1:27:19| the comptroller defines that every governmental audit is done under the governmental auditing standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5239)|
| 1:27:25| We do in excess of 100 of those every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5245)|
| 1:27:31| So we're very familiar with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5251)|
| 1:27:33| I mean, we know what's involved in those standards, and that is those are the only standards that heretofore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5253)|
| 1:27:40| now hopefully in this new charter that you have you maybe add some more standards in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5260)|
| 1:27:46| but up until now those are the only standards that your internal auditor is required to go by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5266)|
| 1:27:53| And have you ever done a peer review of an internal auditor before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5273)|
| 1:28:00| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5280)|
| 1:28:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5281)|
| 1:28:02| So this would be your first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5282)|
| 1:28:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5283)|
| 1:28:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5284)|
| 1:28:05| We do have an internal audit practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5285)|
| 1:28:06| We do not do any governmental internal auditing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5286)|
| 1:28:11| Generally our fees are a little bit too high for most governments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5291)|
| 1:28:14| but we have an extensive internal audit practice, so we're familiar with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5294)|
| 1:28:19| We just do it in the private sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5299)|
| 1:28:21| And just one last question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5301)|
| 1:28:24| Have you been contacted by the mayor's office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5304)|
| 1:28:26| Have they tried to influence you in any way on the direction that you would go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5306)|
| 1:28:34| I received about a two-inch thick document from the mayor's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5314)|
| 1:28:38| which after I looked at the first page I closed it, and it's not been open since.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5318)|
| 1:28:43| At some point it may be appropriate to read that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5323)|
| 1:28:48| This is not that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5328)|
| 1:28:50| That's way on later in the engagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5330)|
| 1:28:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5332)|
| 1:28:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5333)|
| 1:28:56| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5336)|
| 1:28:59| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5339)|
| 1:29:01| I'd just like to thank Dr. Carsello for, one, his time, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5341)|
| 1:29:10| and not just today but throughout this whole process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5350)|
| 1:29:13| But today I'd like to thank him for his honesty and his candor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5353)|
| 1:29:18| I tend to agree that a lot of people, not just auditing firms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5358)|
| 1:29:27| but people dealing with the county in terms of services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5367)|
| 1:29:32| I don't think we're helping ourselves with the recent actions that we're taking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5372)|
| 1:29:40| And it's going to get to a point where a lot of people aren't going to want to deal with the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5380)|
| 1:29:45| and that would be unfortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5385)|
| 1:29:48| I think it is a shame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5388)|
| 1:29:50| And, you know, as bad as the economy is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5390)|
| 1:29:53| we have staffing positions come up and we'll get hundreds of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5393)|
| 1:29:59| And these are individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5399)|
| 1:30:01| But even on our proposals that we have out there, we'll get, you know, a dozen proposals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5401)|
| 1:30:08| whereas before, you know, when things were going a little more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5408)|
| 1:30:14| the economy was a little more robust, we'd get about half of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5414)|
| 1:30:17| So in all these challenging times, for us to get three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5417)|
| 1:30:22| and really two qualified responses to our proposal, I think is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5422)|
| 1:30:31| I won't call it an indictment, but I will say it should speak loudly to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5431)|
| 1:30:36| that hopefully we'll start to get on with the business of the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5436)|
| 1:30:41| and kind of start correcting these things that we haven't done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5441)|
| 1:30:45| I mean, it's been eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5445)|
| 1:30:46| We should have had it a long time ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5446)|
| 1:30:48| So hopefully this process will start to get a little simpler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5448)|
| 1:30:54| and people will want to start dealing with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5454)|
| 1:30:57| Because it can come to a point where we can ask for something and we get zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5457)|
| 1:31:01| I think everyone thinks, oh, well, you know, we're Knox County, we're 400,000 plus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5461)|
| 1:31:05| People are going to just beat our door down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5465)|
| 1:31:08| But I beg to disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5468)|
| 1:31:11| I guess I've got a question for, and maybe Dwight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5471)|
| 1:31:15| Dr. Garcello mentioned that one of the auditors or one of the firms that respond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5475)|
| 1:31:24| or respondees, and this may be for Hugh, I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5484)|
| 1:31:28| mayor staff had general concerns with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5488)|
| 1:31:32| I'd just like to get a response from you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5492)|
| 1:31:34| I know you may not be able to go into too much detail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5494)|
| 1:31:36| but I would like to get a response from that so I can get a better understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5496)|
| 1:31:42| You want them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5502)|
| 1:31:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5503)|
| 1:31:49| Commissioner, the concern we had centered on the fact that on March 16th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5509)|
| 1:31:56| Mr. Troyer and I filed a formal complaint against Mr. Walls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5516)|
| 1:32:01| with the Institute for Internal Audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5521)|
| 1:32:04| And it was our belief then and now that the organization might have a difficult time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5524)|
| 1:32:11| sending an independent and objective team to conduct a peer review of an office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5531)|
| 1:32:17| of internal audit that was headed up by a member against whom a complaint had been filed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5537)|
| 1:32:23| So we outlined those concerns in a memo to the law department and the purchasing director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5543)|
| 1:32:28| And as Dr. Carcello alluded, the law department opined that the potential for a conflict did exist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5548)|
| 1:32:35| and the Institute for Internal Audit was eliminated from consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5555)|
| 1:32:39| So that's a 15-second history of our concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5559)|
| 1:32:43| I hope that helps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5563)|
| 1:32:44| Yeah, that definitely helps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5564)|
| 1:32:45| Dwight, when did you file a complaint?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5565)|
| 1:32:47| March 6th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5567)|
| 1:32:48| March 16th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5568)|
| 1:32:50| 16th, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5570)|
| 1:32:53| And I guess my last statement is kind of, I think I'm piggybacking on what Commissioner Hammond was kind of alluding to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5573)|
| 1:33:01| I may be a little more blunt than he was in terms of, you know, our employees, folks that report to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5581)|
| 1:33:12| If there is, if this body votes to do A, an employee B chooses not to, I mean, I think that will be a bad thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5592)|
| 1:33:26| I think this body, especially in this process, I think we have spent a lot of, oh, man, my buzzer went off there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5606)|
| 1:33:34| But that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5614)|
| 1:33:35| Tank's not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5615)|
| 1:33:36| I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5616)|
| 1:33:40| Have you forgotten I've chaired this before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5620)|
| 1:33:42| I know how to use a gavel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5622)|
| 1:33:44| Okay, okay, I'm almost done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5624)|
| 1:33:46| My concern is, bottom line concern, is that, you know, if we tell someone who reports to us to do something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5626)|
| 1:33:56| and he or she chooses not to, I really don't think that's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5636)|
| 1:34:01| I really don't think that's a good precedent, especially after we've carefully deliberated over it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5641)|
| 1:34:06| We didn't make a knee-jerk reaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5646)|
| 1:34:08| But if we're saying we're going to allow this, I think it gets us into some very dangerous ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5648)|
| 1:34:15| So hopefully it won't get to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5655)|
| 1:34:17| But I do want to be on record saying I'm not for insubordination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5657)|
| 1:34:23| Are you done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5663)|
| 1:34:24| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5664)|
| 1:34:26| That's more like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5666)|
| 1:34:27| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5667)|
| 1:34:29| I had my light on on this side for an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5669)|
| 1:34:32| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5672)|
| 1:34:33| I've got you next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5673)|
| 1:34:35| Well, I'm working off of Tank's list here, and you were next and then Ivan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5675)|
| 1:34:41| And I know you had yours off, but I was going to go to you just to see if you had it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5681)|
| 1:34:45| If you would like to switch, we'll go to Ivan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5685)|
| 1:34:48| There are three things in this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5688)|
| 1:34:51| The first is that the contract be voided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5691)|
| 1:34:54| We've heard from the law director we probably should not void this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5694)|
| 1:34:59| The second item is a 202H.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5699)|
| 1:35:02| Mr. Walls may have taken that off the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5702)|
| 1:35:05| And if the first one is true, the third one is moot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5705)|
| 1:35:09| So we probably could go on with going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5709)|
| 1:35:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5714)|
| 1:35:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5715)|
| 1:35:16| Commissioner Ivan Harvin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5716)|
| 1:35:18| I just had one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5718)|
| 1:35:19| I attended one audit committee meeting, and I think Mr. Walls was out of the office for several days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5719)|
| 1:35:26| He took some personal time off to do some personal business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5726)|
| 1:35:29| And, Dr. Carsell, I don't think you meant it intentionally to embarrass anybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5729)|
| 1:35:33| but you did say that the office employees were being unmanaged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5733)|
| 1:35:38| And I know that's not true because I did make a trip up out of the office to see if he had been called in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5738)|
| 1:35:42| and given him some instructions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5742)|
| 1:35:43| And he came in some of those times he was supposed to be off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5743)|
| 1:35:46| He didn't come in half a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5746)|
| 1:35:48| My suggestion would be to Mr. Walls, you know, to be a better man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5748)|
| 1:35:53| I know sometimes it's hard to bite the bullet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5753)|
| 1:35:55| but, you know, to go ahead and accept the fact that you're going to go through this audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5755)|
| 1:35:58| And I feel like Mr. Hewitt's company is going to find out what a great job you've been doing for the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5758)|
| 1:36:04| and will move this county forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5764)|
| 1:36:06| Because we've been fighting this stuff for months, and it's time to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5766)|
| 1:36:11| And I appreciate him being a better man and going ahead and accepting the fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5771)|
| 1:36:14| and let's do this thing and get it over with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5774)|
| 1:36:20| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5780)|
| 1:36:23| My point was very short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5783)|
| 1:36:26| Mr. Walls kind of alluded, he didn't want a hint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5786)|
| 1:36:30| His correct statement, if I'm not wrong, was without a hint of conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5790)|
| 1:36:34| He wanted the Association of Government and Local Auditors to do his review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5794)|
| 1:36:37| Well, he's, I'm assuming, as part of that association, so there would be your conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5797)|
| 1:36:42| And so I'm with Mr. Harmon that we just need to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5802)|
| 1:36:47| If we need to make some changes, we'll make them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5807)|
| 1:36:50| But, you know, this commission is, half of this agenda is fixing things that didn't go right in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5810)|
| 1:36:57| State street, the ethics committee, the, you know, no peer review in nine years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5817)|
| 1:37:04| So this agenda is we're fixing the commission's mistakes of the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5824)|
| 1:37:10| And I think that it's, like Commissioner Harmon said, it's time to man up and move on and patch our mistakes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5830)|
| 1:37:19| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5839)|
| 1:37:23| I'm going to make this quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5843)|
| 1:37:27| I'm going to vote for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5847)|
| 1:37:29| I think I'm probably about the only one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5849)|
| 1:37:34| But it really doesn't matter how I vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5854)|
| 1:37:36| It doesn't matter how any of us votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5856)|
| 1:37:38| If a critical review comes back, citizens aren't going to believe it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5858)|
| 1:37:45| You know, the ones that side with the mayor and like the mayor are going to say, oh, goody, goody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5865)|
| 1:37:50| You know, Richard audited the mayor and, well, they got him audited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5870)|
| 1:37:56| Citizens that don't like the mayor, they're going to look at it and they're going to say, oh, that's just that crafty old mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5876)|
| 1:38:05| He got audited and he didn't like how the audit looked, so he went out and got the auditor audited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5885)|
| 1:38:10| So it really doesn't matter because there's not going to be any credibility in this because there's been a red flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5890)|
| 1:38:19| Richard has stepped forward and said, I'm concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5899)|
| 1:38:23| I'm concerned that the firm that they've got auditing me is connected to an organization that's very close to the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5903)|
| 1:38:33| The commissioners that are really championing this are commissioners that in the past have been close to the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5913)|
| 1:38:42| Now, I'm proud to say that we don't have the problems that we used to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5922)|
| 1:38:46| It seems like that the various governmental departments are getting along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5926)|
| 1:38:51| and we're getting along a lot better than we used to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5931)|
| 1:38:56| This just brings up memories of all that factional fighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5936)|
| 1:39:00| If this is one last thing we have to go through, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5940)|
| 1:39:03| Because it doesn't really matter because the citizens are watching| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5943)|
| 1:39:06| and the ones that don't like the administration are going to say this is all a witch hunt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5946)|
| 1:39:14| It's all set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5954)|
| 1:39:15| They've done got close friends of, you know, in fact, I think Rutherford Moss was one of the biggest donors to the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5955)|
| 1:39:22| what was that booze budget called, the hospitality fund?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5962)|
| 1:39:28| It's riddled with conflicts of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5968)|
| 1:39:30| So nobody's going to take this very seriously anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5970)|
| 1:39:33| So I'm going to vote against it just as a matter of principle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5973)|
| 1:39:36| But it doesn't matter if they come back with a good review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5976)|
| 1:39:39| That will be great and I certainly hope that they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5979)|
| 1:39:41| But if they don't, nobody's going to trust it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5981)|
| 1:39:45| And there's very little in this government that people trust these days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5985)|
| 1:39:49| And we have ourselves to blame because we've got up here and we've gotten in factions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5989)|
| 1:39:55| and we've fought amongst each other and the public just don't really trust us anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=5995)|
| 1:40:00| And so that's what they think we're doing now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6000)|
| 1:40:01| We're just having yet another fight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6001)|
| 1:40:03| We've got to, you know, one side's on top now so we've got to kick Richard Wall's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6003)|
| 1:40:07| because he brought out audits that were critical of the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6007)|
| 1:40:13| So, you know, it doesn't really matter and I'm going to vote against it just on principle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6013)|
| 1:40:19| Commissioner Paxton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6019)|
| 1:40:22| Yes, I would just like to say one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6022)|
| 1:40:26| Commissioner Briggs said that he went through a peer review every year at the finance meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6026)|
| 1:40:34| I talked to him after that and I asked him if doctors done his peer review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6034)|
| 1:40:38| He said, oh, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6038)|
| 1:40:40| You'll correct me if I'm wrong on this, Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6040)|
| 1:40:42| He said, it has to be heart surgeons like me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6042)|
| 1:40:47| It seems to me like that that's what Mr. Walls is asking for, someone in his field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6047)|
| 1:40:56| I can understand him being upset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6056)|
| 1:40:59| Mr. Anders talks about and Commissioner McKenzie over here talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6059)|
| 1:41:06| that we haven't had a peer review in eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6066)|
| 1:41:10| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6070)|
| 1:41:12| But we haven't been doing audits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6072)|
| 1:41:14| We've been doing reviews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6074)|
| 1:41:17| We had an audit committee that consisted, before this came about and I've never been on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6077)|
| 1:41:24| of the finance chair and the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6084)|
| 1:41:28| They instructed Mr. Walls what to do and graded him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6088)|
| 1:41:36| I am going to vote against this, too, because I really feel like that it's not his peers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6096)|
| 1:41:43| They're checking him out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6103)|
| 1:41:44| I'm Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6104)|
| 1:41:46| Did you not tell me that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6106)|
| 1:41:48| I just want to go in that a peer means one of your own kind would be my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6108)|
| 1:41:53| I did say that to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6113)|
| 1:41:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6115)|
| 1:41:57| That means you're going to vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6117)|
| 1:41:59| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6119)|
| 1:42:04| I know we've been here a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6124)|
| 1:42:06| and I really appreciate everyone's patience who stuck with us through this whole meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6126)|
| 1:42:12| and who have come here from out of town and who are not paid to be here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6132)|
| 1:42:19| but I really do take exception to what you've said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6139)|
| 1:42:29| It seems to me that we have got three of the most honorable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6149)|
| 1:42:36| and most well-respected commissioners out of the 19 of us on the Audit Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6156)|
| 1:42:43| We have Dr. Carsello, who is unparalleled, apparently, in the country, chairing this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6163)|
| 1:42:52| We have bent over backwards, and I have to say I have attended almost every Audit Committee meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6172)|
| 1:42:58| for as long as I could stand to be there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6178)|
| 1:43:03| and I think that the Audit Committee has bent over backwards to assure that there is no conflict of interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6183)|
| 1:43:10| and that there is no ties to the administration or to Mr. Walz,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6190)|
| 1:43:17| so that this could be independent and fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6197)|
| 1:43:21| And you're right that citizens who have an ax to grind on one side or the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6201)|
| 1:43:26| are going to think that no matter who does this audit or no matter how it turns out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6206)|
| 1:43:31| but the thinking citizens of Knox County who are truly paying attention to what we're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6211)|
| 1:43:39| are going to see this and realize that good work is being done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6219)|
| 1:43:44| and I think that they will see that this peer review is supposed to highlight what Richard is doing well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6224)|
| 1:43:53| and offer suggestions for things that he might could do better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6233)|
| 1:43:58| No one is out to get Richard, and I hope, Richard, that you understand that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6238)|
| 1:44:04| Now, I really take exception to that on behalf of the thinking citizens of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6244)|
| 1:44:11| as well as the rest of us who are sitting up here and those who are out observing this meeting tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6251)|
| 1:44:17| That was, I think, very disrespectful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6257)|
| 1:44:21| Commissioner, I guess we're ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6261)|
| 1:44:26| Mr. Chairman, could I make one comment, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6266)|
| 1:44:29| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6269)|
| 1:44:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6270)|
| 1:44:31| With regard to our alleged lack of independence, the only thing I have to sell is my reputation and time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6271)|
| 1:44:42| And once the reputation goes, I can't sell my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6282)|
| 1:44:47| We do not take on engagements in which we're not independent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6287)|
| 1:44:51| It's not worth the risk, no matter what the amount of money is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6291)|
| 1:44:55| I don't know any of you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6295)|
| 1:44:58| I know a couple of partners that wrote for MOSC because we're in the same profession| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6298)|
| 1:45:02| and we run into each other at meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6302)|
| 1:45:05| Had I known what the ruckus it was going to raise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6305)|
| 1:45:09| I know other CPAs up here that I could have put down as references, and maybe I should have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6309)|
| 1:45:17| We have no connection to the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6317)|
| 1:45:19| I never even met the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6319)|
| 1:45:20| I wouldn't know him if he walked in the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6320)|
| 1:45:24| And no one called me to say, you want to put in a proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6324)|
| 1:45:28| My marketing director found a reference to you all's proposal on the Internet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6328)|
| 1:45:32| That's how we were notified of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6332)|
| 1:45:36| So we have no connection to anybody up here, which it would seem would be what you need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6336)|
| 1:45:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6343)|
| 1:45:44| We have a motion on the floor to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6344)|
| 1:45:46| Motion to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6346)|
| 1:45:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6347)|
| 1:45:50| Everyone ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6350)|
| 1:45:51| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6351)|
| 1:45:52| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6352)|
| 1:45:53| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6353)|
| 1:45:54| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6354)|
| 1:45:56| How many no's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6356)|
| 1:45:58| Two no's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6358)|
| 1:46:02| Motion passes 15-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6362)|
| 1:46:07| Mr. Chairman, again, I have a question for our internal auditor, Mr. Walls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6367)|
| 1:46:11| You've seen the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6371)|
| 1:46:12| You said you were going to wait to see the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6372)|
| 1:46:14| Will you cooperate with this peer review?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6374)|
| 1:46:17| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6377)|
| 1:46:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6378)|
| 1:46:21| 805.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6381)|

| 1:47:00| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6420)|
| 1:47:01| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6421)|

| 1:47:04| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6424)|
| 1:47:07| I'd like to make an amendment to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6427)|
| 1:47:09| We can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6429)|
| 1:47:13| Buzz, would you care to come down just a moment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6433)|
| 1:47:16| Well, he's doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6436)|
| 1:47:17| Mr. Chairman, a clarification for me, a point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6437)|
| 1:47:21| 913, item 913, was that on consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6441)|
| 1:47:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6446)|
| 1:47:27| I know it doesn't have a star.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6447)|
| 1:47:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6449)|
| 1:47:31| It did pass on consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6451)|
| 1:47:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6453)|
| 1:47:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6454)|
| 1:47:35| There were two people waiting here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6455)|
| 1:47:36| That's already passed on consent and with the language, the one word added that I suggested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6456)|
| 1:47:40| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6460)|
| 1:47:41| So for the two people waiting on that one, it's already passed on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6461)|
| 1:47:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6464)|
| 1:47:45| I told them a little earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6465)|
| 1:47:47| Buzz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6467)|
| 1:47:49| I believe you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6469)|
| 1:47:50| We're just enjoying themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6470)|
| 1:47:55| Go ahead and give them your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6475)|
| 1:47:57| Buzz Goss, 110 West Summit Hill Drive, which ironically is at the corner of Marble Alley and Summit Hill Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6477)|
| 1:48:04| I believe you said you would not ask for a TIF on this when you were up here before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6484)|
| 1:48:08| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6488)|
| 1:48:09| I said I have no intention of asking for a TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6489)|
| 1:48:10| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6490)|
| 1:48:11| I would like to amend this since we're selling it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6491)|
| 1:48:13| I feel like at a reduced price and what we have in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6493)|
| 1:48:16| Put an amendment on here that there be no TIFs granted on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6496)|
| 1:48:23| The one thing I'd ask you to consider, and, you know, the commission's pleasure as to how they choose this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6503)|
| 1:48:29| is that there may be at some point a project which warrants that TIFs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6509)|
| 1:48:35| Now, I don't know what that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6515)|
| 1:48:36| But there may be some project where I come back and say the merits of this project I think would warrant this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6516)|
| 1:48:41| And I'd ask the commission to consider changing the ban if you put that amendment on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6521)|
| 1:48:47| or voting however you feel about it at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6527)|
| 1:48:51| I'm not here to say I'm asking for a TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6531)|
| 1:48:54| But there also might be a need for a TIF the way they're used in South Knoxville to do public improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6534)|
| 1:48:59| But, of course, I don't think that would run through us anyhow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6539)|
| 1:49:05| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6545)|
| 1:49:06| But you're talking about the road we built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6546)|
| 1:49:08| Yes, sir, the road and sidewalks and trees and, you know, streetlights, those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6548)|
| 1:49:13| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6553)|
| 1:49:14| And it certainly needs it down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6554)|
| 1:49:16| Well, I'll go along with you on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6556)|
| 1:49:18| But, you know, you've got 13 different parcels here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6558)|
| 1:49:22| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6562)|
| 1:49:23| Are you going to tie them all up together?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6563)|
| 1:49:27| They will probably be reconfigured as we put the finishing touches on our development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6567)|
| 1:49:33| But in the long run, yes, I guess they will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6573)|
| 1:49:38| Maybe I didn't understand your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6578)|
| 1:49:40| Well, what I was getting to, maybe you could come back parcel after parcel as you develop this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6580)|
| 1:49:46| and ask for a TIF and see whether instead of just getting it all on one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6586)|
| 1:49:50| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6590)|
| 1:49:51| I think that would be reasonable to come back and see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6591)|
| 1:49:53| That's what I'd like to amend it to then, if that's fair with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6593)|
| 1:49:56| I think that's not unreasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6596)|
| 1:49:58| Could you repeat that, Commissioner Pinkston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6598)|
| 1:50:01| There's 13 parcels here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6601)|
| 1:50:02| And as he develops each parcel, instead of us giving a blanket TIF on all 13,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6602)|
| 1:50:08| he comes back and pleads his case, I guess is the way to put it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6608)|
| 1:50:12| On a case-by-case basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6612)|
| 1:50:13| It's a case-by-case basis for a TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6613)|
| 1:50:15| Is there 13 parcels in this county-owned project or just 13 parcels that Boz owns or wants to own?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6615)|
| 1:50:22| We have one parcel, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6622)|
| 1:50:23| No, you have 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6623)|
| 1:50:24| No, I think 13 is collectively known as a state street property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6624)|
| 1:50:30| I mean, but isn't that what he's going to have to do anyway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6630)|
| 1:50:33| I don't see what that's saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6633)|
| 1:50:34| Well, first we need to know if the maker of the motion accepts this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6634)|
| 1:50:38| I accept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6638)|
| 1:50:40| And the second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6640)|
| 1:50:41| I accept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6641)|
| 1:50:43| Is that good with you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6643)|
| 1:50:45| Boz, is that good with you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6645)|
| 1:50:46| Which one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6646)|
| 1:50:48| Where you each have to come back each individual on each 13 parcels if you ask for a TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6648)|
| 1:50:54| I mean, I think that is reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6654)|
| 1:50:56| That's the way it would happen anyhow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6656)|
| 1:50:57| We would be coming back and saying, hey, this project here, you know, is X project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6657)|
| 1:51:02| which has these community values and it's going to cost this kind of money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6662)|
| 1:51:05| and to make the bridge the gap we might need this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6665)|
| 1:51:07| That's the way it would happen as a matter of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6667)|
| 1:51:09| So I think that's probably reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6669)|
| 1:51:11| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6671)|
| 1:51:12| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6672)|
| 1:51:14| Yeah, Boz, I just want to make sure of this because I've seen TIFs in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6674)|
| 1:51:19| where they would take whole sides of town, like empowerment zones, and get a huge TIF on the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6679)|
| 1:51:27| And I just want to make sure this doesn't mess up your other properties that you already own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6687)|
| 1:51:33| What I was thinking is you might have a project where you want to combine your properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6693)|
| 1:51:38| And I'll say this, if I look at this piece of property on its own, it's a clear piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6698)|
| 1:51:45| You know, there's nothing, there's no buildings there that need to be rehabbed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6705)|
| 1:51:50| And so I would think that that particular property would be less TIFable, for lack of a better word,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6710)|
| 1:51:58| than some of the buildings that you already own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6718)|
| 1:52:01| Some of the buildings you already own I think are actually poster buildings for a place for tax increment financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6721)|
| 1:52:10| But I just want to make sure that we don't tie your hands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6730)|
| 1:52:13| because isn't there a possibility you could declare part of this State Street property part of the TIF zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6733)|
| 1:52:23| to help get more money for some of the really bad, you know, there's worse buildings in town than some of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6743)|
| 1:52:30| But for some of the buildings that are really going to need a lot of work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6750)|
| 1:52:34| don't often you combine them together into one TIF zone so that you can get the money that you need to rehab maybe a nice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6754)|
| 1:52:43| historic building that needs an excessive amount of work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6763)|
| 1:52:46| You know, that's a very good point, and that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6766)|
| 1:52:49| And that has been used in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6769)|
| 1:52:51| Ironically, David Dewhurst, my partner, and I own the JC Penney building downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6771)|
| 1:52:56| And he and I were just chatting about it, and I said to him, you know, this really isn't for the faint of heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6776)|
| 1:53:01| And that's the building that probably is the poster child for some sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6781)|
| 1:53:04| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6784)|
| 1:53:05| I mean, again, if you'll go along with this, I'll go along with Mr. Pinkston's suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6785)|
| 1:53:10| But like I said, I look at other cities, and, you know, tax increment financing is a wonderful tool for rehabilitation of areas of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6790)|
| 1:53:23| And I can see where you have, if you've got a building that needs, there's a larger gap between viability for the TIF that by combining it with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6803)|
| 1:53:33| clear piece of property, if this property was by itself and going to be developed by itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6813)|
| 1:53:39| I wouldn't believe that it would in any way qualify for a TIF because it's a nice, clean lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6819)|
| 1:53:45| But what I'm worried about, I just don't want us to do something tonight that inhibits your ability to rehab some of those other properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6825)|
| 1:53:55| And, again, I think some of those buildings are interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6835)|
| 1:53:58| They add flavor to our town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6838)|
| 1:54:00| And if they were rehabbed, I think they would be a benefit to our town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6840)|
| 1:54:05| And I just want to make sure we're not tying your hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6845)|
| 1:54:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6848)|
| 1:54:09| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6849)|
| 1:54:10| But I'm not sure that Commissioner Pinkston's suggestion changes that, does it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6850)|
| 1:54:13| I mean, we could come in with four of them and say, well, the TIFs on these are going to help us do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6853)|
| 1:54:17| Would you approve that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6857)|
| 1:54:19| Is that, am I understanding it correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6859)|
| 1:54:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6861)|
| 1:54:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6862)|
| 1:54:23| What I don't want is just to give you a blanket TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6863)|
| 1:54:25| Fair enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6865)|
| 1:54:27| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6867)|
| 1:54:29| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6869)|
| 1:54:31| Both, as we had talked about when we had a chance to get together, I explained to you, I was pretty honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6871)|
| 1:54:38| You were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6878)|
| 1:54:39| Maybe brutally honest with you, my feelings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6879)|
| 1:54:43| But you were kind in the way you did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6883)|
| 1:54:45| Well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6885)|
| 1:54:48| You weren't brutally honest at all, but thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6888)|
| 1:54:50| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6890)|
| 1:54:53| And part of it had to deal with the way the price would escalate during the term of these options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6893)|
| 1:55:04| And you and I came to an agreement that you said you could, that you didn't have a problem with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6904)|
| 1:55:13| instead of it being a 2% increase for every two-year increment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6913)|
| 1:55:19| because I felt like that was not enough of an increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6919)|
| 1:55:23| because normally when we do our property taxes, we're taking a look at maybe a 2% growth every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6923)|
| 1:55:32| Now, I know we're in a depressed economy right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6932)|
| 1:55:35| and real estate values may not be escalating what it normally would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6935)|
| 1:55:40| And that's why I agreed for the first two years that we'd keep that at that 2%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6940)|
| 1:55:50| So if you were to purchase it in year three, you would still be paying that 2% increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6950)|
| 1:56:01| I think we talked about 1%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6961)|
| 1:56:03| It was 1% for the, well, years one and two, we would keep that at that 2%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6963)|
| 1:56:09| So that's what it says right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6969)|
| 1:56:12| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6972)|
| 1:56:13| That's what it says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6973)|
| 1:56:14| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6974)|
| 1:56:15| But then the subsequent years, it was a 2% increase per year on an annual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6975)|
| 1:56:20| So that in year three, that's when it renews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6980)|
| 1:56:25| So that would be the price would increase by 2%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6985)|
| 1:56:29| But then it would increase at the, on an annual basis by an additional 2%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6989)|
| 1:56:35| You're still good with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6995)|
| 1:56:37| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6997)|
| 1:56:38| My understanding was that we talked about in the first year there probably realistically won't be any increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=6998)|
| 1:56:43| Well, I'm saying if you buy it in years one and two, there is no increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7003)|
| 1:56:47| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7007)|
| 1:56:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7008)|
| 1:56:49| Year three would be the 2%, which is the way it is right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7009)|
| 1:56:52| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7012)|
| 1:56:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7013)|
| 1:56:54| But year four, it would go to a 4%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7014)|
| 1:56:57| Or an additional 2%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7017)|
| 1:56:58| Another additional 2%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7018)|
| 1:57:00| And then so forth in years five and six would increase an additional 2%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7020)|
| 1:57:06| So that in year six, it would be an 8% increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7026)|
| 1:57:09| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7029)|
| 1:57:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7030)|
| 1:57:11| The only difference that I remember is that we talked about zero for the first year, 1% for the second year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7031)|
| 1:57:17| and then 2% a year after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7037)|
| 1:57:19| That's what I remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7039)|
| 1:57:21| But, you know, my memory isn't the best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7041)|
| 1:57:23| If you want to do that, because I was giving you year two as a zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7043)|
| 1:57:27| No, at the beginning of year three, it would go up by 1%, not in the year two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7047)|
| 1:57:33| No, the way it's written right now is that in year three, it would go up 2%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7053)|
| 1:57:37| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7057)|
| 1:57:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7058)|
| 1:57:39| My memory of our conversation, though, was that it would go up 1% at the beginning of year three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7059)|
| 1:57:45| 2% at the beginning of year four, an additional 2% at five, and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7065)|
| 1:57:52| The bell went off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7072)|
| 1:57:54| Well, I mean, it was my recognition that I was giving you the 1% annual for the first two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7074)|
| 1:58:01| And then, which would be really, it's the $3 million for years one and two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7081)|
| 1:58:10| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7090)|
| 1:58:11| Year three was the 2%, which is what it originally says in the contract right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7091)|
| 1:58:15| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7095)|
| 1:58:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7096)|
| 1:58:17| And then from there on, it was a 2% annual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7097)|
| 1:58:20| Okay, fair enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7100)|
| 1:58:21| Maybe you and I just misunderstood something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7101)|
| 1:58:24| Are you good with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7104)|
| 1:58:25| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7105)|
| 1:58:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7106)|
| 1:58:28| So if the maker of the motion would agree to that amendment, Commissioner Norman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7108)|
| 1:58:38| he has agreed to a change in how the price increases over time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7118)|
| 1:58:46| that the first two years and even into year three would remain the same,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7126)|
| 1:58:51| but from there, instead of it going up 2% on a two-year basis, it would go up 2% annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7131)|
| 1:59:00| And he has agreed to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7140)|
| 1:59:03| Are you willing to amend your motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7143)|
| 1:59:06| Yes, I'd be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7146)|
| 1:59:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7147)|
| 1:59:08| And the second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7148)|
| 1:59:09| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7149)|
| 1:59:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7151)|
| 1:59:14| Then no other light, so we're ready to vote, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7154)|
| 1:59:17| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7157)|
| 1:59:22| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7162)|
| 1:59:24| Well, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7164)|
| 1:59:25| Good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7165)|
| 1:59:27| I should say, I really do have a lot of appreciation for how much effort you put into these meetings, I tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7167)|
| 1:59:32| It's a thankless job, but I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7172)|
| 1:59:35| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7175)|
| 1:59:36| Have a good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7176)|
| 1:59:38| On page 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7178)|
| 1:59:41| Are we ever going to have a break, Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7181)|
| 1:59:46| I was like...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7186)|
| 1:59:47| Yeah, we need a break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7187)|
| 1:59:48| Is that okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7188)|
| 1:59:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7189)|
| 1:59:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7190)|
| 1:59:51| This is 907.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7191)|
| 1:59:52| That's the worst.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7192)|
| 1:59:53| It'd be on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7193)|
| 1:59:54| It's a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee, approving a review by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7194)|
| 2:00:11| the Knox Full Bar Association Panel for the hearing rules of procedure adopted by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7211)|
| 2:00:22| the Knox County Ethics Committee for their ethics complaint investigations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7222)|
| 2:00:27| This is Resolution 907.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7227)|
| 2:00:30| Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7230)|
| 2:00:33| 10-0 to approve with amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7233)|
| 2:00:35| General Governmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7235)|
| 2:00:37| 6-0 to approve with amendment. So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7237)|
| 2:00:41| Mayor, second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7241)|
| 2:00:43| I'll second it. Could you remind us what the amendment was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7243)|
| 2:00:47| I believe it was to have two different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7247)|
| 2:00:51| That's correct. It would be one to look at the 202H and then the other would be the ethics thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7251)|
| 2:01:02| Did you have something else, Commissioner Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7262)|
| 2:01:04| Yes. Commissioner Briggs, and I'm sure you're going to address this, you have posted on the commission forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7264)|
| 2:01:12| the articles that the military would follow for an investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7272)|
| 2:01:18| I guess my concern is the fact that we've had two hearings now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7278)|
| 2:01:23| and I know that you've shared these same concerns as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7283)|
| 2:01:25| that we've had attorneys show up, they have made objections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7285)|
| 2:01:28| evidence has been presented, testimony has been presented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7288)|
| 2:01:31| there are transcripts made of these hearings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7291)|
| 2:01:34| and as a result, they can go on to another body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7294)|
| 2:01:39| So I guess my concerns are I would like to see the ethics committee address three things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7299)|
| 2:01:43| and again, the ethics committee doesn't have to if they don't want to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7303)|
| 2:01:46| but I would suggest that they look at the scope of what they should look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7306)|
| 2:01:50| Should they be looking at felonies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7310)|
| 2:01:52| I believe that when the legislature enacted the law that they were looking at the ethics policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7312)|
| 2:01:57| and violations of that policy, which would include things like conflicts of interest, gifts, and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7317)|
| 2:02:02| Secondly, if the ethics committee feels that it should move ahead with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7322)|
| 2:02:06| then I believe that there has to be a strict procedure of how these meetings are going to be conducted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7326)|
| 2:02:14| Do you get a hearing officer, for example?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7334)|
| 2:02:16| How do you accept evidence?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7336)|
| 2:02:18| If you have attorneys, how are they going to resolve conflicts when they make objections and so forth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7338)|
| 2:02:26| I don't know that any member of the ethics committee is adequate to answer those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7346)|
| 2:02:33| And I guess the third thing that I would ask is that in terms of conflicts of interest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7353)|
| 2:02:38| in the last vote that the ethics committee made, out of nine people, only four felt that they could even vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7358)|
| 2:02:46| The others felt that they were conflicted, that they had conflicts of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7366)|
| 2:02:50| So if this is going to kind of be a pattern and we have members that can't vote because they're conflicted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7370)|
| 2:02:56| then I think these are things that should be looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7376)|
| 2:02:58| But above and beyond that, today we had on our agenda for a 202H.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7378)|
| 2:03:04| We do not have a procedure in place to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7384)|
| 2:03:06| And so my recommendation is, as far as the 202H, is that we move ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7386)|
| 2:03:10| and have people with the Bar Association, former judges, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7390)|
| 2:03:15| that would present us with a suggested list of procedures and let us look at them and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7395)|
| 2:03:21| okay, if we should do a 202H in the future, this is how that hearing would be conducted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7401)|
| 2:03:25| This way, for anybody that is subject to that 202H, they know what the procedures are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7405)|
| 2:03:30| They know what the rules are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7410)|
| 2:03:31| And this is going to take a little bit of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7411)|
| 2:03:33| It's not something that's going to happen in one month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7413)|
| 2:03:37| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7417)|
| 2:03:39| Yes, I guess really the first question is, does this commission have any authority to tell the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7419)|
| 2:03:45| and I'm not disagreeing with the thing that you said, by the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7425)|
| 2:03:48| and maybe I could direct this to the law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7428)|
| 2:03:51| does this commission have any authority to tell the Ethics Committee how to conduct their inquiries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7431)|
| 2:03:57| and hearings and procedures?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7437)|
| 2:04:00| Well, sir, members of the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7440)|
| 2:04:03| in terms of getting involved in the day-to-day affairs of the Ethics Committee, no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7443)|
| 2:04:08| and for obvious reasons, the perceived conflict of interest and undue influence, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7448)|
| 2:04:14| where your power and authority lies is that when the state enacted the Local Government Professionalism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7454)|
| 2:04:21| and Ethics Act, it required you to adopt an ethics charter, so to speak, an ethics policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7461)|
| 2:04:29| The state legislature then delegated that responsibility to the county technical advisory services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7469)|
| 2:04:37| CTAS, and asked them to promulgate a model policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7477)|
| 2:04:40| Counties then had two options, one, adopt the model policy or adopt one of their own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7480)|
| 2:04:45| You adopted, or I should say the commission adopted, the model policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7485)|
| 2:04:49| Model policy basically will then advise the Ethics Committee as to their duties, responsibilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7489)|
| 2:04:56| power, and authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7496)|
| 2:04:58| So you have to look at the structure and the function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7498)|
| 2:05:01| Rather than getting involved in the manner in which they're currently conducting business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7501)|
| 2:05:06| I think you have to go back and look at the overall charter that's been promulgated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7506)|
| 2:05:10| to see whether or not you feel that needs to be refined, because right now it is broad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7510)|
| 2:05:15| Right now it does cite various criminal statutes, everything from perjury to misuse of authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7515)|
| 2:05:24| et cetera, et cetera, as you've seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7524)|
| 2:05:27| I wish there was a short answer, but the long answer is your power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7527)|
| 2:05:30| and authority lies in the enabling legislation, which is the audit charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7530)|
| 2:05:36| I'm sorry, ethics charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7536)|
| 2:05:37| I've still got audit on the brain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7537)|
| 2:05:39| Ethics charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7539)|
| 2:05:41| You know, I think that what we're going to have to do is just to avoid any appearances of the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7541)|
| 2:05:47| having political meddling in what's supposed to be an ethics committee and what they do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7547)|
| 2:05:52| I would hope that when the ethics committee meets again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7552)|
| 2:05:55| we're going to have an after-action review of what we've done in these first two hearings that we've had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7555)|
| 2:06:02| because they were conducted in two entirely different fashions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7562)|
| 2:06:05| One was really just like a court proceeding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7565)|
| 2:06:11| is where when one of the people that was speaking wanted to give his version of events| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7571)|
| 2:06:17| and the other attorney objected saying, you know, you need to answer this in a yes or no question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7577)|
| 2:06:23| And as we all know, frequently there's shades of gray, but also if a person is defending himself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7583)|
| 2:06:29| I think he should have the right to stand up and say this is what I want to say to defend myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7589)|
| 2:06:34| and that was objected to, you know, by the attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7594)|
| 2:06:39| The other thing is that I don't object really to having some of the judges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7599)|
| 2:06:44| and the Knoxville Bar Association becoming involved in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7604)|
| 2:06:48| but the problem is that they start using models with which they're the most familiar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7608)|
| 2:06:53| such as the grand jury or really a preliminary hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7613)|
| 2:06:57| And I know I had a very long, and if anybody read it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7617)|
| 2:07:01| I hope the only reason you read it was to put yourself to sleep at night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7621)|
| 2:07:04| but I put a very long posting on the commission forum on what an Article 32 investigation is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7624)|
| 2:07:12| And as I mentioned in there, it has some distinct advantages over grand jury hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7632)|
| 2:07:16| First of all, they're not secret.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7636)|
| 2:07:18| First of all, the defendant has the right to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7638)|
| 2:07:20| The defendant has the right to have his lawyer there, none of which occurs in a grand jury hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7640)|
| 2:07:24| And it's also different from a preliminary hearing in that more evidence is presented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7644)|
| 2:07:32| and also in the Article 32 hearings is that the investigating officer is permitted to ask questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7652)|
| 2:07:39| Now, of course, if there's either a 202H or an ethics committee hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7659)|
| 2:07:44| the investigating officers are the entire committee that's listening to the case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7664)|
| 2:07:48| but they do have the right to ask questions, and they're really serving as both the judge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7668)|
| 2:07:53| and the jurors and, to a certain extent, the attorneys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7673)|
| 2:07:57| in that they're having the privilege of cross-examining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7677)|
| 2:08:00| But what they're really trying to do is to get to the truth of the matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7680)|
| 2:08:05| and to try to bring all of the facts forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7685)|
| 2:08:08| It also resembles the Article 32 investigation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7688)|
| 2:08:13| resembles more what we were doing in the ethics committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7693)|
| 2:08:16| is because the final conclusion in an Article 32 investigation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7696)|
| 2:08:20| there's no determination made, there's just recommendations based on the facts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7700)|
| 2:08:24| that are made by the investigating committee, and then they refer it on to someone else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7704)|
| 2:08:28| and that's really what the ethics committee does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7708)|
| 2:08:30| So much of what I wrote pertains maybe more to an investigation or a procedure by the ethics committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7710)|
| 2:08:39| than what a 202H does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7719)|
| 2:08:41| Another part of the 202 investigation is I've lost my train of thought now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7721)|
| 2:08:55| I thought he was talking to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7735)|
| 2:08:58| But the point being is that, oh, I know what I was going to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7738)|
| 2:09:01| because this came up before about the rights of the people during these procedures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7741)|
| 2:09:07| is that there's actually a statement that the officer has to read to the defendant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7747)|
| 2:09:12| detailing the specifics of what his rights are and what he may do and not do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7752)|
| 2:09:19| and that's all to protect him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7759)|
| 2:09:22| And that's something that's not necessarily part of a grand jury investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7762)|
| 2:09:28| I guess if we want to get my only concern is that when you bring the judges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7768)|
| 2:09:33| and the lawyers into this is that it starts to become more defensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7773)|
| 2:09:38| and more legalistic and not where you're really trying to find the information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7778)|
| 2:09:43| that you're trying to find out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7783)|
| 2:09:45| And I guess that's my only concern about doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7785)|
| 2:09:51| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7791)|
| 2:09:55| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7795)|
| 2:09:56| I pointed out from the very beginning when we formed the ethics committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7796)|
| 2:10:00| that there was potential for problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7800)|
| 2:10:03| One thing I think I'd like to see the ethics committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7803)|
| 2:10:07| the scope of the ethics committee's ability to investigate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7807)|
| 2:10:12| I would like to see it focused strictly on their ethics policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7812)|
| 2:10:18| so that they can't go outside of Knox County's ethics policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7818)|
| 2:10:22| Would anybody have a problem with making that a friendly amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7822)|
| 2:10:26| that we keep the ethics committee focused on the ethics policy as it's written| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7826)|
| 2:10:32| and not anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7832)|
| 2:10:34| Well, I think it actually is, but the problem is we use the model from the UT advisory service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7834)|
| 2:10:42| and that's the one I think that Mr. Jarrett was referring to where it has a whole list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7842)|
| 2:10:47| It's about a page and a half of, I mean, it's everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7847)|
| 2:10:52| It includes criminal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7852)|
| 2:10:55| It includes civil problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7855)|
| 2:10:57| I mean, I personally think it's much too extensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7857)|
| 2:11:02| That's what we voted on to accept, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7862)|
| 2:11:04| I know we voted on to accept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7864)|
| 2:11:06| What I'd like to limit it to is things like gifts, conflicts of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7866)|
| 2:11:13| If we could limit it to just those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7873)|
| 2:11:15| Here's the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7875)|
| 2:11:17| The ethics committee is a body of political appointees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7877)|
| 2:11:21| and people who get appointed to things, they have friends in politics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7881)|
| 2:11:26| That's how they get appointed to things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7886)|
| 2:11:28| Their friends appoint them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7888)|
| 2:11:30| I just appointed my high school, well, me and Brad just appointed my high school drama teacher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7890)|
| 2:11:35| and a teacher from Brad's church school to the library board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7895)|
| 2:11:40| That's how people get appointed to these boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7900)|
| 2:11:43| It's their known or their friends of someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7903)|
| 2:11:47| And that's the problem, how these things get political.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7907)|
| 2:11:51| And I think we need an ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7911)|
| 2:11:53| I think we need somebody, you know, to make sure that we're not out, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7913)|
| 2:11:58| taking lavish gifts from folks we had no relationship with before we were involved in county government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7918)|
| 2:12:05| You know, I think we need somebody that looks into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7925)|
| 2:12:07| But when they have absolutely no restraint or when their directive is like Dr. Briggs said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7927)|
| 2:12:14| is pages and pages of things that they can look into,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7934)|
| 2:12:18| then the potential is there for them to go after anything they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7938)|
| 2:12:25| And I think their scope needs to be really limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7945)|
| 2:12:29| Could we, I'm not sure who we would ask, whether we would ask the Bar Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7949)|
| 2:12:37| or whether we would just decide ourselves, but I think we have to set some parameters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7957)|
| 2:12:43| so that they're not just looking at everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7963)|
| 2:12:48| Does anybody have any suggestions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7968)|
| 2:12:50| I would think at the very least they need to look at gifts and conflict of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7970)|
| 2:12:55| And I'm okay if we want to just throw out a list of things we want to limit their scope to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7975)|
| 2:13:00| I think that would require a charter change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7980)|
| 2:13:03| Am I correct, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7983)|
| 2:13:06| It would at least require a change to the ethics code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7986)|
| 2:13:11| Not necessarily a change to the charter, but a change to the code that you've adopted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7991)|
| 2:13:18| which I believe was adopted by ordinance, so it would require an ordinance change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=7998)|
| 2:13:24| Mr. Chairman, I would like to limit my resolution to just the 202H.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8004)|
| 2:13:29| Anything with the ethics, I'll defer to Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8009)|
| 2:13:34| And I'll go ahead and make a motion that we go ahead and ask the Bar Association to give us a procedure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8014)|
| 2:13:39| a suggested procedure for a 202H investigation and leave it at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8019)|
| 2:13:44| Even though we're not going to be having one in the foreseeable future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8024)|
| 2:13:47| Well, I think that's why we need to go ahead and get it, because it's going to take some time to get it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8027)|
| 2:13:51| I'm fine with that, just clarifying it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8031)|
| 2:13:53| Yes, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8033)|
| 2:13:54| If I could, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8034)|
| 2:13:56| That would be a substitute motion, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8036)|
| 2:13:58| Then I'll make a substitute motion that we focus on the 202H, and that will be my substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8038)|
| 2:14:04| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8044)|
| 2:14:05| And in answer to Mr. Harmon, that's when you make the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8045)|
| 2:14:08| You make the rules when there's not an investigation going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8048)|
| 2:14:11| I'm fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8051)|
| 2:14:12| I was just clarifying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8052)|
| 2:14:14| If I could, Mr. Chairman, members of the commission, just so you understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8054)|
| 2:14:18| the teeth involved in that is the ability to have subpoena power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8058)|
| 2:14:23| Investigations are normally worthless if you can't compel witnesses, which is a complaint of the ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8063)|
| 2:14:28| Your code does read that in terms of the subpoena power portion of a 202H,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8068)|
| 2:14:35| it defaults to the Tennessee rules of civil procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8075)|
| 2:14:39| So what I think you'll need, I would suggest you do, perhaps I should draft the letter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8079)|
| 2:14:44| and I can give it to the commission for review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8084)|
| 2:14:46| But when we do ask the Knoxville Bar to look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8086)|
| 2:14:50| we need to advise them at a minimum that we're already bound by civil rules of procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8090)|
| 2:14:55| So what we're going to look to them for is something more definitive in terms of how the actual investigation evolves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8095)|
| 2:15:02| or I should say the hearing evolves, rather than the subpoena power issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8102)|
| 2:15:05| which defaults to the rules of civil procedure, which I suspicion most attorneys would default to anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8105)|
| 2:15:11| Right, and I would agree with our law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8111)|
| 2:15:13| That's the intent here is how would you conduct a hearing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8113)|
| 2:15:17| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8117)|
| 2:15:20| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8120)|
| 2:15:21| I think best that I recuse myself from this vote, but I do have some strong opinions of it, but I'll keep that to myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8121)|
| 2:15:29| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8129)|
| 2:15:32| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8132)|
| 2:15:34| If I go to the Knox County website and then to the ethics page, there are five things that I can look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8134)|
| 2:15:45| One is a blank form to fill out if I want to complain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8145)|
| 2:15:49| And right, well, back at the home page of the ethics committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8149)|
| 2:15:56| it sort of says things like Commissioner Lambert is talking about, gifts and conflicts of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8156)|
| 2:16:04| But if I go to the one that's the policy, it's definitive and gives out the Knox County ethics policy, and that's definitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8164)|
| 2:16:21| Is that not correct, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8181)|
| 2:16:23| It's not the big long list of things that we could or could not have in our policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8183)|
| 2:16:31| It is the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8191)|
| 2:16:33| That's correct, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8193)|
| 2:16:34| So I believe and I would assume that that policy was enacted or enabled by us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8194)|
| 2:16:43| and if it were to be amended, it would be by us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8203)|
| 2:16:46| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8206)|
| 2:16:47| That is correct, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8207)|
| 2:16:48| So the ethics committee probably needs to then â€“ I really started out with a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8208)|
| 2:16:56| I wanted to know if my assumptions were correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8216)|
| 2:17:00| And now if my assumptions are correct, then we do have an ethics policy that's very definitive in what is to be looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8220)|
| 2:17:10| And it's on the Knox County website, and it has been placed there because we voted on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8230)|
| 2:17:19| The only other question that I have is related to the current holders of the committee position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8239)|
| 2:17:32| Currently, I think we're accepting â€“ not us, the law director's office is accepting self-nomination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8252)|
| 2:17:41| for vacancies that exist or will exist on the ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8261)|
| 2:17:46| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8266)|
| 2:17:47| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8267)|
| 2:17:48| There are two openings, and if knowledge serves me properly, those two openings were committee appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8268)|
| 2:17:56| In other words, when the commission created the ethics committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8276)|
| 2:17:59| they afforded them the opportunity to actually appoint two of their members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8279)|
| 2:18:02| and then a certain amount were appointed by the commission, I think, and one by the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8282)|
| 2:18:06| I don't remember the â€“ I don't have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8286)|
| 2:18:08| But, yes, two openings, and they are soliciting â€“ it's closed now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8288)|
| 2:18:12| but as of the 23rd of September they were soliciting people who were showing an interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8292)|
| 2:18:16| Some of the questions I've been asked is people can look at this committee makeup on the website| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8296)|
| 2:18:22| because those people are named.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8302)|
| 2:18:25| Also, the composition of the committee is given by who gets to appoint and for how long a term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8305)|
| 2:18:33| I would like to see those names that are currently members of the ethics committee be designated their term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8313)|
| 2:18:41| and appointment and who appointed them so that we don't get another two or three years down the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8321)|
| 2:18:47| and then forget who came from where.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8327)|
| 2:18:51| Would that be possible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8331)|
| 2:18:53| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8333)|
| 2:18:54| On the ethics webpage, it does read that there are seven citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8334)|
| 2:19:00| and it reads three such citizens shall be appointed by the Knox County Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8340)|
| 2:19:04| two such citizens shall be appointed by the Knox County Mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8344)|
| 2:19:07| two such citizens shall be appointed by the Knox County Ethics Committee following an open process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8347)|
| 2:19:12| allowing citizens to seek appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8352)|
| 2:19:14| And I believe that's what's going on now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8354)|
| 2:19:16| Those two openings are the two committee appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8356)|
| 2:19:19| But it also has in another place there some for one year, some for two years, some for three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8359)|
| 2:19:24| getting everyone into a three-year rotation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8364)|
| 2:19:31| Every appointment is going to be on a three-year rotation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8371)|
| 2:19:36| We had to stagger that because some people stayed on there and all the terms are the same,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8376)|
| 2:19:41| but some of them can't serve but one year now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8381)|
| 2:19:46| That's why I believe Ron Stewart is coming off, Dr. Stewart is coming off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8386)|
| 2:19:52| and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8392)|
| 2:19:53| You can't serve but so many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8393)|
| 2:19:55| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8395)|
| 2:19:56| All the terms are the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8396)|
| 2:20:01| Well, the committee was just established in the last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8401)|
| 2:20:06| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8406)|
| 2:20:07| Oh, no, no, no, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8407)|
| 2:20:08| 2007, based upon the 2006 Comprehensive Government Ethics Reform Act of 2006,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8408)|
| 2:20:15| required by 2007 for political subdivisions of the state to adopt ethics policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8415)|
| 2:20:22| I was on there at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8422)|
| 2:20:24| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8424)|
| 2:20:25| And I would like to see, so that I can answer the question of people, the person was appointed by which entity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8425)|
| 2:20:35| because these rotate around, and also when their term ends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8435)|
| 2:20:42| I believe that's on page five of the policy, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8442)|
| 2:20:45| It reads, terms of office shall be for three years with initial appointments after September 1, 2008,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8445)|
| 2:20:51| as follows, one-year term, then there's a two-year term and a three-year term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8451)|
| 2:20:55| But you'll need to amend this policy if you're going to start staggering terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8455)|
| 2:21:02| or getting more uniformity in terms of length of terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8462)|
| 2:21:06| And I think what my question is, who appointed the individuals that are there now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8466)|
| 2:21:11| and when does their term end?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8471)|
| 2:21:13| Because they're not all going to end at the same time, are they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8473)|
| 2:21:16| Because we've got two openings right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8476)|
| 2:21:18| Yes, correct, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8478)|
| 2:21:19| The only two I'm aware of, because I don't have the legislative history,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8479)|
| 2:21:22| is I know that the two that are there now are the committee appointees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8482)|
| 2:21:27| In other words, a committee appointed by the Ethics Committee and they're expiring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8487)|
| 2:21:30| But we'll get you that information clearly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8490)|
| 2:21:32| We have to just do a little digging into the archives and torment the clerk a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8492)|
| 2:21:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8498)|
| 2:21:39| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8499)|
| 2:21:42| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8502)|
| 2:21:44| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8504)|
| 2:21:48| I don't mean in any way to be insulting to the, by the way, you all gentlemen look very handsome in your bow ties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8508)|
| 2:21:54| I don't mean in any way at all to be insulting to the Ethics Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8514)|
| 2:21:58| because I have tremendous respect for my daughter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8518)|
| 2:22:00| But my 17-year-old daughter claims that she's independent from her dad and I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8520)|
| 2:22:07| And we agree with that to an extent, but you might say that we're responsible for her charter too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8527)|
| 2:22:13| And I feel kind of the same way about the Ethics Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8533)|
| 2:22:17| that they are partially independent but that the commission's responsible for the charter that they operate by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8537)|
| 2:22:26| And I would like to give the Ethics Committee a few months to self-evaluate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8546)|
| 2:22:32| and see if they can come to any kind of decision about anything that they can do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8552)|
| 2:22:38| hopefully review their last two situations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8558)|
| 2:22:44| and see if there's any way that they can improve upon what they've been doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8564)|
| 2:22:48| And if that's not the case, then I think that this commission needs to look at redoing that charter, I feel like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8568)|
| 2:22:58| And this is no criticism intended to the previous commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8578)|
| 2:23:01| but that it was accepted, the CTAS charter was accepted without really maybe understanding the implications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8581)|
| 2:23:10| or without any thinking very far forward about what might happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8590)|
| 2:23:16| Because I think we wound up with something that was not intended by the state legislature when they passed this legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8596)|
| 2:23:23| So that's my feeling on how I'm going to pursue this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8603)|
| 2:23:31| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8611)|
| 2:23:33| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8613)|
| 2:23:35| Could you help me focus or somebody help me focus where we are right now in terms of the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8615)|
| 2:23:42| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8622)|
| 2:23:44| It has to do with 202H or does it have to do with the formation of the Ethics Committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8624)|
| 2:23:50| 202H.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8630)|
| 2:23:51| My motion is 202H.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8631)|
| 2:23:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8633)|
| 2:23:54| So we're really talking towards 202H.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8634)|
| 2:23:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8635)|
| 2:23:56| That's good because every time I hear that word I start to get a rash or some kind of reaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8636)|
| 2:24:02| And in deference to Mr. Hammond, I see that how some people would like to have clarity on how that could occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8642)|
| 2:24:15| Now, 202H, refresh me again, that just applies to us, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8655)|
| 2:24:19| That doesn't apply to the Ethics Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8659)|
| 2:24:21| That's just our action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8661)|
| 2:24:23| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8663)|
| 2:24:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8664)|
| 2:24:26| And so I wonder if it would not be wise, since we do not have anything like that looming over us in the near future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8666)|
| 2:24:35| if we don't, you know, I've made it clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8675)|
| 2:24:39| I don't want to get into anything that even closely, vaguely resembles 202H.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8679)|
| 2:24:45| And, therefore, maybe if we did not ask the Bar Association that question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8685)|
| 2:24:51| and we did not have procedures, maybe that would push that farther off into the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8691)|
| 2:24:56| And so that would be my tendency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8696)|
| 2:25:00| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8700)|
| 2:25:02| Yeah, and I just see Mike Hammond turned his light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8702)|
| 2:25:08| After him, I'd like to call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8708)|
| 2:25:11| And I hope his comments are about 202H because what I see is we've actually split these apart| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8711)|
| 2:25:18| and we're talking about both of them at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8718)|
| 2:25:20| And those of us who came to the luncheon have been here for nine hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8720)|
| 2:25:24| so it would make it a lot cleaner if we only had comments about 202H,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8724)|
| 2:25:31| then we vote, and then we go back to Ethics Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8731)|
| 2:25:35| And I know I'm getting old, and it would help me if we did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8735)|
| 2:25:40| No, I was going to respond to Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8740)|
| 2:25:42| I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8742)|
| 2:25:43| I hope we never have to go into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8743)|
| 2:25:45| But we had something similar to a 202H when, you know, the mayor was here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8745)|
| 2:25:50| We had a request on the agenda today for a 202H.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8750)|
| 2:25:54| So it's out there, and it is part of our charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8754)|
| 2:25:57| And I think that it behooves us, since we don't have anything looming in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8757)|
| 2:26:01| is let's go ahead and, again, this is going to take some time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8761)|
| 2:26:04| let's get some recommendations on how we would do a procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8764)|
| 2:26:08| And let's look at it, and let's adopt it, and let's have it available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8768)|
| 2:26:11| so that should we get to that point, we already have it set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8771)|
| 2:26:14| So that would be my recommendation is that we just go ahead and get these suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8774)|
| 2:26:19| We have a motion on the floor for a 202H.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8779)|
| 2:26:26| Advice from the Bar Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8786)|
| 2:26:28| Advice from the Bar Association panel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8788)|
| 2:26:31| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8791)|
| 2:26:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8793)|
| 2:26:34| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8794)|
| 2:26:35| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8795)|

| 2:27:58| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8878)|
| 2:27:59| Intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8879)|
| 2:28:00| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8880)|
| 2:28:02| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8882)|
| 2:28:03| Properly moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8883)|
| 2:28:05| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8885)|
| 2:28:07| Is there a provision in this for them to give us a yearly budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8887)|
| 2:28:13| I mean, if they're going to be getting these fees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8893)|
| 2:28:15| I would like to see them provide us with a yearly budget or something to show how the money is being spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8895)|
| 2:28:22| I mean, is that possible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8902)|
| 2:28:23| Jackie, can you do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8903)|
| 2:28:25| I mean, can we just do it as kind of a, I don't want to change the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8905)|
| 2:28:28| but can this be just kind of a matter of understanding that the mediation center would provide us with their yearly budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8908)|
| 2:28:33| or something to that effect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8913)|
| 2:28:36| What they do with the county money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8916)|
| 2:28:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8918)|
| 2:28:39| In other words, how you're spending these dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8919)|
| 2:28:40| Yes, sir, we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8920)|
| 2:28:42| And I had sent around some projections of how we would spend it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8922)|
| 2:28:46| but we can, you know, as they become real budgets, we can certainly send them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8926)|
| 2:28:51| Jackie, can you give the commission your name and your organization?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8931)|
| 2:28:54| My name is Jackie Kittrell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8934)|
| 2:28:56| I'm the executive director of Community Mediation Center, 912 South Gay Street, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8936)|
| 2:29:02| If I could, Mr. Chairman, members of the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8942)|
| 2:29:04| Ms. Kittrell, just this morning when that gentleman came before you regarding his complaint about his family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8944)|
| 2:29:10| she's already met with him, already trying to contact the family to resolve that issue, again, through the mediation process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8950)|
| 2:29:18| Well, we might just send someone over to sit here during commission meetings and receive referrals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8958)|
| 2:29:26| Is that commissioner against commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8966)|
| 2:29:27| Yeah, it might be us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8967)|
| 2:29:30| I'll say commissioner versus commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8970)|
| 2:29:32| Just so the commission, I'm pretty sure you all understand that the dollar tax doesn't hit the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8972)|
| 2:29:40| It comes in through the collection at the clerk's office and varies, you know, depending on how many cases there are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8980)|
| 2:29:49| So it isn't a budget item, per se, but thank you very much for your support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8989)|
| 2:29:53| But if you could just give us an accounting of these monies and how they're being spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8993)|
| 2:29:58| Commissioner, Grant Rosenberg, Office of Neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=8998)|
| 2:30:01| Today, on your agenda, you did have an MOU with the Community Mediation Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9001)|
| 2:30:06| We do directly appropriate funds with them each year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9006)|
| 2:30:09| and we do monitor that contract or that MOU that we have with the mediation center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9009)|
| 2:30:14| We do request some reporting along with that MOU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9014)|
| 2:30:18| And, yeah, we do give the grants office all of our reporting statistics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9018)|
| 2:30:25| We have maybe eight success indicators that we keep track of for the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9025)|
| 2:30:31| But if you just make sure that it includes the financial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9031)|
| 2:30:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9033)|
| 2:30:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9035)|
| 2:30:36| Does that answer your question, Commissioner Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9036)|
| 2:30:38| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9038)|
| 2:30:40| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9040)|
| 2:30:41| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9041)|
| 2:30:43| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9043)|
| 2:30:44| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9044)|
| 2:30:45| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9045)|
| 2:30:46| We're going back to 9-10, page 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9046)|
| 2:30:50| Chairman, I appreciate you moving that forward for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9050)|
| 2:30:53| Consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9053)|
| 2:30:56| determining the method of disposal of property known as the Frank Strange Senior Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9056)|
| 2:31:01| in the shared satellite offices of the Knox County Trustee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9061)|
| 2:31:05| Knox County Health Department located at 10280 Cedar Bluff Road, resolution 9-10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9065)|
| 2:31:11| Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9071)|
| 2:31:12| 6-0 to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9072)|
| 2:31:13| Intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9073)|
| 2:31:15| 6-0 to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9075)|
| 2:31:17| I'll get a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9077)|
| 2:31:19| I'm going to make a motion to defer 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9079)|
| 2:31:21| I think there's a lot of questions unanswered about this that people have raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9081)|
| 2:31:27| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9087)|
| 2:31:29| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9089)|
| 2:31:30| Commissioner Lutho?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9090)|
| 2:31:32| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9092)|
| 2:31:34| Since the location on old Cedar Bluff Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9094)|
| 2:31:39| that's where my office is located as far as the Trustee's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9099)|
| 2:31:45| and I'm going to ask, since I think that there could be a possible conflict of interest for me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9105)|
| 2:31:52| as far as that part of this resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9112)|
| 2:31:56| if the question is divided between the Frank Strange building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9116)|
| 2:32:02| and the office building on old Cedar Bluff Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9122)|
| 2:32:07| I felt like I could vote on the Frank Strange part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9127)|
| 2:32:10| but I do feel like I have a conflict with the old Cedar Bluff Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9130)|
| 2:32:14| If they're divided, I think I can vote on at least part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9134)|
| 2:32:17| If not, I think I'll have to recuse myself of the entire matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9137)|
| 2:32:25| Commissioner Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9145)|
| 2:32:26| Yeah, I want to speak in favor of the motion to defer this for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9146)|
| 2:32:33| Just to give you a little background, over the past, probably about the past two and a half months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9153)|
| 2:32:38| I've been working with some of the senior citizens that use the Strange Center out of West Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9158)|
| 2:32:45| and they've expressed concerns over the parking, over the crowding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9165)|
| 2:32:49| when they have certain scheduled activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9169)|
| 2:32:52| I've talked with both the Mayor and Mike Arms this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9172)|
| 2:32:56| and I think that what we ought to do is defer this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9176)|
| 2:33:00| I've received phone calls, I think just like Mike Hammond and maybe some others have also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9180)|
| 2:33:06| that there's a lot of misunderstanding about what this motion actually means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9186)|
| 2:33:10| There's been all sorts of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9190)|
| 2:33:11| The county's trying to sell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9191)|
| 2:33:12| They never talk to anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9192)|
| 2:33:13| Those are all false.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9193)|
| 2:33:15| For anyone listening, that's not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9195)|
| 2:33:18| And I think what we need to have is a town hall meeting out at the Strange Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9198)|
| 2:33:23| and we could invite all the commissioners that would be involved in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9203)|
| 2:33:26| and this includes certainly those in the fourth, fifth, and sixth districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9206)|
| 2:33:30| And I know the Mayor's office is interested in having a representative there also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9210)|
| 2:33:34| and for that reason I think it would be best to get the citizen input before we vote on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9214)|
| 2:33:40| And I think that's agreeable to all the parties involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9220)|
| 2:33:46| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9226)|
| 2:33:50| Yeah, I just wanted to speak a little bit of it too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9230)|
| 2:33:53| One of the misconceptions that were going around is that I was trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9233)|
| 2:33:55| or somebody was trying to close the senior center on Kingston Pike there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9235)|
| 2:34:01| just east of the Farragut City limits and move it to Carnes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9241)|
| 2:34:04| That was furthest from the truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9244)|
| 2:34:08| You know, my request was I went to the administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9248)|
| 2:34:11| and the people in Carnes have asked for a senior center for many years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9251)|
| 2:34:14| and at one time had been told one was coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9254)|
| 2:34:17| And, you know, I wasn't here and I can't speak to what happened with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9257)|
| 2:34:22| but so I went and spoke to the Mayor's office about a senior center in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9262)|
| 2:34:29| And the idea was brought to me about maybe opening up a, for lack of a better term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9269)|
| 2:34:37| a government annex building that contained a senior center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9277)|
| 2:34:41| and other government services in the same building in a centrally located area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9281)|
| 2:34:47| Now, that centrally located area would probably not be in the 6th District based on population,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9287)|
| 2:34:53| based on available locations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9293)|
| 2:34:58| based on being closer to those south of Middlebrook and Cedar Bluff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9298)|
| 2:35:04| And so the idea that we want to close one and open another is furthest from the truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9304)|
| 2:35:11| And an upgrade at the other facility on Old Cedar Bluff, it is necessary, or not necessary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9311)|
| 2:35:17| but it's becoming the most used satellite office in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9317)|
| 2:35:21| or I say the most increase in uses in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9321)|
| 2:35:26| So, I mean, there is a lot of things to be discussed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9326)|
| 2:35:29| and this resolution is to float the idea of selling the two buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9329)|
| 2:35:35| It's not to sell the two buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9335)|
| 2:35:38| And I understand that we're probably going to defer this for 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9338)|
| 2:35:42| but if commission met with the mayor's office and the grants office at Strange Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9342)|
| 2:35:49| we wouldn't have enough parking for the citizens to show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9349)|
| 2:35:52| So, you know, I'm not against having a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9352)|
| 2:35:57| I think the more the public is informed, the better off we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9357)|
| 2:36:00| And I don't believe, from what I understand, the mayor is not going to close one until the other one opens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9360)|
| 2:36:05| And so I think it's irresponsible for people to be spreading rumors that are not true,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9365)|
| 2:36:13| especially when my name is attached to them, because if you need the truth, just come and ask me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9373)|
| 2:36:18| But this is just a floating idea of selling to see if it's feasible financially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9378)|
| 2:36:23| If it's not feasible, I'm still not going to get a senior center in the 6th District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9383)|
| 2:36:27| right in this current financial climate, and I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9387)|
| 2:36:32| But that's just the idea was floated for that very reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9392)|
| 2:36:36| And it's not to take away services, it's to add to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9396)|
| 2:36:40| because soon the Strange Center will be unusable just based on the size of the use that it has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9400)|
| 2:36:49| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9409)|
| 2:36:51| Yeah, I'm in the same position and take the same position that Mr. Anders does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9411)|
| 2:36:57| You know, when this was brought to me, it was brought to me as we're going to explore this ideal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9417)|
| 2:37:02| And, Dwight, I'd like to talk to you for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9422)|
| 2:37:07| Just have a couple of questions for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9427)|
| 2:37:10| Let's say we don't defer this for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9430)|
| 2:37:13| Let's say that we voted in favor of this tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9433)|
| 2:37:19| How long would it take for you to do the RFPs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9439)|
| 2:37:23| That's really a purchasing question, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9443)|
| 2:37:25| I don't think they'll be on the street for normally 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9445)|
| 2:37:29| and there'd probably be two to three weeks involved in putting it together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9449)|
| 2:37:33| So, conservatively, I think it'd probably be about an eight-week turnaround.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9453)|
| 2:37:38| And if I could, I just would like to echo what Commissioner Anders said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9458)|
| 2:37:43| We're certainly sorry this has gotten the agitation that it has or created the agitation that it has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9463)|
| 2:37:49| because it's really nothing more than sort of floating the idea out there, first and foremost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9469)|
| 2:37:53| to see if the commercial real estate market is even poised to absorb these properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9473)|
| 2:37:59| And in all candor, we're not at all confident that it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9479)|
| 2:38:03| And then, secondly, if it was poised to absorb these properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9483)|
| 2:38:06| would it absorb them at a rate that would allow us to build a single,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9486)|
| 2:38:10| larger consolidated center for the fifth and sixth districts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9490)|
| 2:38:14| But it's really nothing more than an opportunity to test the waters in the market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9494)|
| 2:38:19| to see how the commercial market responds, and then see if the idea is even viable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9499)|
| 2:38:23| So these discussions about and these concerns about programming being canceled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9503)|
| 2:38:29| and senior centers being closed and services being unavailable are completely unfounded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9509)|
| 2:38:36| And this is just an attempt to see what the market might or might not support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9516)|
| 2:38:41| Okay, let me ask you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9521)|
| 2:38:43| If I understood you right, and, again, it's late and I'm not 20 years old anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9523)|
| 2:38:50| If I understand you right, if we approve this tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9530)|
| 2:38:54| the very earliest that this could come before this body again would be two months away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9534)|
| 2:39:02| And that's being overly optimistic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9542)|
| 2:39:04| Well, actually, it's being a little conservative, I suppose, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9544)|
| 2:39:07| If we really stepped on the gas, we might be able to bring it back to you sooner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9547)|
| 2:39:10| But I'd rather err on the side of caution and tell you that I think in order to get certainly leave it on the street for 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9550)|
| 2:39:19| and to get some sort of results and come back to you, yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9559)|
| 2:39:24| I think it's probably a reasonable estimate to say eight weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9564)|
| 2:39:26| And then after that, it doesn't obligate you to do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9566)|
| 2:39:29| It doesn't obligate us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9569)|
| 2:39:30| So if we got a, you know, let's just say, let's say we got a very generous offer for both of these properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9570)|
| 2:39:39| You know, 60 days or two months from now, we wouldn't run right out and sell the properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9579)|
| 2:39:46| and create the new senior center without public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9586)|
| 2:39:52| I mean, what I think we've got going here is we're just exploring the ideal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9592)|
| 2:39:56| and floating the ideal of seeing what would happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9596)|
| 2:40:00| And so I'm going to make the substitute motion that we just go ahead and approve this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9600)|
| 2:40:04| because it's not like we can't put on the brakes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9604)|
| 2:40:08| All we're doing is we're exploring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9608)|
| 2:40:10| We're going down this path.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9610)|
| 2:40:12| And if we don't like what we see down that path, either for low offers for the properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9612)|
| 2:40:18| or if we don't find another suitable property, we can turn back at any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9618)|
| 2:40:24| So because of that, I'd like to offer the substitute motion, unless Mr. VandeVate has objections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9624)|
| 2:40:31| that we just go ahead and approve this tonight and let them go ahead and start taking a peek at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9631)|
| 2:40:36| We don't object to the proposed deferral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9636)|
| 2:40:39| We're not opposed to moving forward with it tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9639)|
| 2:40:42| One thought I did want to share with you is that if it went forward tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9642)|
| 2:40:45| and at some point we come back to you with some sense of what the market would support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9645)|
| 2:40:50| one option the body could consider at that time is to develop a committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9650)|
| 2:40:57| It would include members of this commission and probably senior center consumers from the 5th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9657)|
| 2:41:03| from Commissioner Briggs' district, Commissioner Hammond's district, the 6th district obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9663)|
| 2:41:09| along with perhaps senior center staff to figure out how you might move something like this forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9669)|
| 2:41:15| So we're fine either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9675)|
| 2:41:17| I just wanted to help allay those concerns that you might be hearing from your constituents about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9677)|
| 2:41:22| is my senior center going to close?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9682)|
| 2:41:24| No, absolutely not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9684)|
| 2:41:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9686)|
| 2:41:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9687)|
| 2:41:28| Well, I'm going to leave my substitute motion on the floor just to see if I get a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9688)|
| 2:41:32| I just don't see why to put on the brakes when we're not far enough down the road yet to be really concerned about these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9692)|
| 2:41:41| I have a point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9701)|
| 2:41:42| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9702)|
| 2:41:43| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9703)|
| 2:41:44| I have a point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9704)|
| 2:41:45| We have a resolution that was put on the agenda to vote on this tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9705)|
| 2:41:52| There was a resolution to defer it 30 days, and now we're back a third time to get back to resolution number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9712)|
| 2:41:58| Can we do that or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9718)|
| 2:42:02| The motion on the floor now is to substitute motion is original.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9722)|
| 2:42:08| To defer, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9728)|
| 2:42:10| I didn't realize that the deferral was a substitute motion, so I withdraw my motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9730)|
| 2:42:16| since you can't have a substitute to a substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9736)|
| 2:42:19| Well, what I mean, though, there was a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9739)|
| 2:42:21| There was a resolution on the floor to go ahead and approve the bidding process or whatever it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9741)|
| 2:42:26| and then there was a motion on the floor by Robert's Rules of Order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9746)|
| 2:42:32| No, I don't think that one was ever made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9752)|
| 2:42:34| You said the first motion was to defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9754)|
| 2:42:37| The first motion was to defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9757)|
| 2:42:38| Okay, then I'll leave my substitute on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9758)|
| 2:42:40| Okay, I'll agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9760)|
| 2:42:41| I'm going to speak against that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9761)|
| 2:42:43| I think what's going to happen is that you're going to have a tremendous amount of resistance if we do it in this fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9763)|
| 2:42:52| When people are presented with a fait accompli, which means this is a done fact, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9772)|
| 2:42:58| we're already going to put this out, and, you know, we can say, yeah, we're going to discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9778)|
| 2:43:02| We may or may not want to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9782)|
| 2:43:04| This is going to be viewed as this was crammed down the throat of the people, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9784)|
| 2:43:09| out west and the people at the Strang Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9789)|
| 2:43:11| I think that the proper way to do this is that you have your hearings, you get your input, you look at the problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9791)|
| 2:43:17| and then put the RFP out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9797)|
| 2:43:21| I think you're going to change this from a situation where, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9801)|
| 2:43:26| people are going to be very cooperative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9806)|
| 2:43:28| they feel like they've had input into it into a situation where something's been crammed down their throat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9808)|
| 2:43:34| and they're going to be on the slippery slope where they're really not having any input as to what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9814)|
| 2:43:42| And I would vote not to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9822)|
| 2:43:44| I think deferring it 30 days will not hurt a thing, but I tell you, it will sure make the whole process go smoother later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9824)|
| 2:43:51| Commissioner Armstrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9831)|
| 2:43:53| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9833)|
| 2:43:54| I want to make a statement because we had Commissioner Lutho, who this is basically one of his concerns in his district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9834)|
| 2:44:04| and I think we ought to, if we're going to defer it, let's defer it as split property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9844)|
| 2:44:10| and let's explore it as two different items so it will give him an opportunity to at least deal with his constituents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9850)|
| 2:44:15| and deal with that piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9855)|
| 2:44:18| We've already got so many substitute motions now, so I don't even know what to do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9858)|
| 2:44:22| But basically I think we ought to at least split out the business part, functional part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9862)|
| 2:44:29| and the senior citizens part building as separate things so that he'll have an opportunity to vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9869)|
| 2:44:36| Can that be done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9876)|
| 2:44:37| I don't know what the process is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9877)|
| 2:44:38| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9878)|
| 2:44:39| I'll amend my motion if the second will agree that my motion is that we go ahead and approve the strength center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9879)|
| 2:44:48| We approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9888)|
| 2:44:50| It is late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9890)|
| 2:44:51| We split off where Craig works and the rest of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9891)|
| 2:44:58| Y'all likes being here at 10, 30, 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9898)|
| 2:45:02| So your motion now is to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9902)|
| 2:45:05| To just deal with the part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9905)|
| 2:45:08| To deal with this minus Craig's work location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9908)|
| 2:45:14| The property on Old Cedar Bluff Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090928part2?start=9914)|
