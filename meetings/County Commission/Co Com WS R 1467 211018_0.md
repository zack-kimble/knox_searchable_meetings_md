| 0:08:46| We have a county review team for children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=526)|
| 0:08:48| This statute requires that the county itself establish this team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=528)|
| 0:08:53| That is why we thought it was important to bring this resolution before you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=533)|
| 0:08:56| asking that you allow us to create a team here in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=536)|
| 0:09:00| to bring together professionals in the domestic violence field to review domestic violence deaths| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=540)|
| 0:09:06| and see as a community, as a county, where there are gaps in services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=546)|
| 0:09:10| or gaps in things that we do here that we could fill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=550)|
| 0:09:14| to perhaps decrease the number of domestic violence deaths in our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=554)|
| 0:09:20| Are there any questions for the Attorney General? Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=560)|
| 0:09:23| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=563)|
| 0:09:26| Are the metro areas the only ones that are utilizing this type of service?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=566)|
| 0:09:33| The only one that I am aware of at this moment is Davidson County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=573)|
| 0:09:38| and Davidson County does have a team that has been established.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=578)|
| 0:09:42| Unlike child death review where the statute mandates by district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=582)|
| 0:09:48| you can only have one in each judicial district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=588)|
| 0:09:51| this particular statute says that each county may have one of these teams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=591)|
| 0:09:57| Thank you. Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=597)|
| 0:10:00| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=600)|
| 0:10:01| General Allen, with the formation of this team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=601)|
| 0:10:06| how will the data of the work be integrated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=606)|
| 0:10:10| Will it go into the health department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=610)|
| 0:10:12| In your view, how will we sort of understand what the team is finding from this every year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=612)|
| 0:10:18| That's a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=618)|
| 0:10:19| That really is under statute up to the team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=619)|
| 0:10:23| to determine what type of information they want to release and how they want to release it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=623)|
| 0:10:28| The work of the team, it is important to note, is confidential per statute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=628)|
| 0:10:32| and oftentimes the reason that this information should be dealt with confidentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=632)|
| 0:10:38| is because we get a more accurate picture of what's actually happening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=638)|
| 0:10:42| and then it's up to the team to vote as to what reports would be released| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=642)|
| 0:10:47| and how they would be released.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=647)|
| 0:10:49| The information that I would assume we would release as a team would be those reports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=649)|
| 0:10:53| which would detail gaps in services, things that this county could do better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=653)|
| 0:10:58| and I'm sure that those reports would also include some kind of data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=658)|
| 0:11:02| However, those reports probably would not include any identifying information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=662)|
| 0:11:07| No, certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=667)|
| 0:11:09| Are you also working with Clerk Hammond on this as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=669)|
| 0:11:14| Wouldn't this tie into the work that he does on the criminal clerk side?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=674)|
| 0:11:19| He is on the Family Justice Center board with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=679)|
| 0:11:24| and really this is work that would be done probably housed over at the Family Justice Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=684)|
| 0:11:29| and so Mike Hammond would certainly be a part of that probably through the Family Justice Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=689)|
| 0:11:35| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=695)|
| 0:11:38| Thank you, General.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=698)|
| 0:11:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=699)|
| 0:11:40| Mayor Jacobs, did you want to address this issue at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=700)|
| 0:11:42| Okay, thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=702)|
| 0:11:45| I see no lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=705)|
| 0:11:46| We do have a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=706)|
| 0:11:49| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=709)|
| 0:11:51| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=711)|
| 0:11:52| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=712)|
| 0:11:54| That resolution will go on the consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=714)|
| 0:11:58| Madam Clerk, next item 41.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=718)|
| 0:12:00| On page 8, this is item number 41,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=720)|
| 0:12:04| consideration of a resolution approving a contract with U.S. Imaging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=724)|
| 0:12:08| for the provision of backscanning indexes and books for the Knox County Register of Deeds office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=728)|
| 0:12:17| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=737)|
| 0:12:19| I have a motion to approve by Commissioner Smith with a second by Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=739)|
| 0:12:24| Register McBride, would you like to come and speak to this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=744)|
| 0:12:27| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=747)|
| 0:12:31| Nick McBride, Register of Deeds, Knox County, 400 Main Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=751)|
| 0:12:36| This is going to be a contract with us and U.S. Imaging to digitize approximately 1,200 warranty deed books,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=756)|
| 0:12:43| which will start in the mid-1700s and carry us through the 1960s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=763)|
| 0:12:48| and it will also digitize 33 rolls of microfilm that contain the grantor and grantee index| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=768)|
| 0:12:54| from the beginning mid-1700s of Knox County through 1932.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=774)|
| 0:12:59| We're looking at over 700,000 pages of warranty deeds and 24,000 pages of indexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=779)|
| 0:13:06| This project will not require an appropriation from the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=786)|
| 0:13:09| because it will be used from reserve funds of our data processing account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=789)|
| 0:13:14| It is estimated to cost $360,000, but it will come in underneath that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=794)|
| 0:13:21| as we see exactly how many pages each book has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=801)|
| 0:13:24| We didn't go through and count the number of pages in 1,200 books, but it will come in below that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=804)|
| 0:13:29| This is something that I was looking at three years ago when I came into office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=809)|
| 0:13:34| U.S. Imaging was on site, and then with COVID, it's delayed this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=814)|
| 0:13:38| But now with COVID, all the money the federal government is pushing out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=818)|
| 0:13:43| every other municipality in the country is looking to digitize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=823)|
| 0:13:47| So we're fortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=827)|
| 0:13:48| If this contract is approved, they will be here on the 14th of November| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=828)|
| 0:13:52| and will be done the second week of December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=832)|
| 0:13:57| Thank you, Mr. McBride.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=837)|
| 0:13:58| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=838)|
| 0:14:00| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=840)|
| 0:14:02| Nick, you probably just answered the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=842)|
| 0:14:05| So the books won't leave your office, I guess?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=845)|
| 0:14:10| Great question, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=850)|
| 0:14:11| Yes, sir, you're exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=851)|
| 0:14:13| There will be two teams of two that will be working 24 hours a day, seven days a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=853)|
| 0:14:19| So there will be a total of four different teams, but two working each 12-hour shift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=859)|
| 0:14:23| They will start in the basement of the Archives Center, the History Center on Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=863)|
| 0:14:27| They'll be up there for about two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=867)|
| 0:14:29| None of our collection will ever leave our possession.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=869)|
| 0:14:32| And when they're done with the old records, they'll come into the city county building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=872)|
| 0:14:36| and they'll be up there in our office working for a couple weeks to finish the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=876)|
| 0:14:41| But none of our records will be leaving our custody and control here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=881)|
| 0:14:49| Any further questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=889)|
| 0:14:52| Thank you, Nick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=892)|
| 0:14:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=893)|
| 0:14:54| We have a proper motion and a second to approve this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=894)|
| 0:14:56| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=896)|

| 0:15:06| Madam Clerk, we'll resume with item number six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=906)|
| 0:15:10| This is on page two, under Drives and Roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=910)|

| 0:15:21| These are located in the Glen at West Valley in District 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=921)|

| 0:15:30| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=930)|
| 0:15:32| Do we approve those at work session?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=932)|
| 0:15:35| I think we want to send them forward, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=935)|
| 0:15:37| Move them forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=937)|

| 0:15:51| Item number seven is consideration of the closure of the right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=951)|

| 0:17:34| are not eligible for reappointment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1054)|
| 0:17:36| unless there are not enough applicants to fill the positions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1056)|
| 0:17:41| then they can be appointed to another term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1061)|
| 0:17:43| We do have one individual that has applied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1063)|

| 0:18:08| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1088)|
| 0:18:09| If you'll state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1089)|
| 0:18:10| and then you can take a couple of minutes to tell us about yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1090)|
| 0:18:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1093)|

| 0:18:20| I've served Knoxville for several years now as a member at large| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1100)|
| 0:18:26| with the South Knoxville Alliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1106)|
| 0:18:28| and also for the city of Knoxville in the Business Advisory Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1108)|
| 0:18:34| And I really appreciate the opportunity to serve Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1114)|
| 0:18:38| I know that there's a lot of issues with businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1118)|
| 0:18:41| and I'm an entrepreneur myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1121)|
| 0:18:43| I'm also a realtor, so I've dealt a lot with ethics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1123)|
| 0:18:47| So I believe that I would be able to bring a fresh perspective to this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1127)|
| 0:18:53| Thank you, Ms. O'Grode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1133)|
| 0:18:54| Are there any questions from the Commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1134)|
| 0:18:56| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1136)|
| 0:18:57| Thank you, Ms. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1137)|

| 0:19:00| She's awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1140)|
| 0:19:02| I've got a nickname for her, and I asked her if I could say this or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1142)|
| 0:19:06| She's a bad, bad girl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1146)|
| 0:19:08| I'm telling you, she does this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1148)|
| 0:19:11| She ain't afraid to fight boys either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1151)|
| 0:19:13| Not at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1153)|
| 0:19:14| Or men at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1154)|
| 0:19:16| We might have to clarify that for the general public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1156)|
| 0:19:20| So I'm a green belt in Krav Maga, and I'm a blue belt in jujitsu,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1160)|
| 0:19:24| and I'm very passionate about sharing that experience with other women.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1164)|
| 0:19:28| Martial arts is one of my passions, and it's something that all women can learn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1168)|
| 0:19:32| So it's something that's very near and dear to my heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1172)|
| 0:19:34| So thank you very much, Carson Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1174)|
| 0:19:36| I appreciate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1176)|
| 0:19:39| Thank you very much for coming to speak to us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1179)|
| 0:19:41| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1181)|
| 0:19:42| Are Mr. Covington or Mr. Stevens with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1182)|
| 0:19:48| We have reached out to both of them to ask if they would be interested in serving again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1188)|
| 0:19:52| because we knew we didn't have enough applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1192)|
| 0:19:55| I believe they both indicated that they would be willing to serve if they were appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1195)|
| 0:20:02| They were not able to be at tonight's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1202)|
| 0:20:04| This is a vote that will be taken next week to fill these two spots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1204)|
| 0:20:10| So do we need a motion to move this forward without recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1210)|
| 0:20:21| Yeah, we have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1221)|
| 0:20:23| I think next week we can nominate her when we actually do the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1223)|
| 0:20:29| We normally wouldn't put a name in the blank at the work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1229)|
| 0:20:32| We can do it next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1232)|
| 0:20:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1233)|
| 0:20:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1234)|
| 0:20:35| I have a motion to move forward without recommendation, then from Commissioner Jade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1235)|
| 0:20:38| Do I have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1238)|
| 0:20:40| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1240)|
| 0:20:41| Second by Commissioner Durrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1241)|
| 0:20:43| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1243)|
| 0:20:45| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1245)|
| 0:20:46| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1246)|
| 0:20:47| We will take care of that appointment at next week's full commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1247)|
| 0:20:51| Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1251)|
| 0:20:53| On page eight, item number 37.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1253)|
| 0:20:58| This is a resolution approving a signed location lease and memorandum of lease agreement with Lamar Companies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1258)|
| 0:21:04| for the renewal of a lease of a billboard located on Knox County property at 4630 Asheville Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1264)|
| 0:21:10| with Knox County to receive rent in the amount of $250 per month, $3,000 annually for a term of 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1270)|
| 0:21:19| Resolution 803.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1279)|
| 0:21:22| I move to move forward without any recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1282)|
| 0:21:27| Motion by Commissioner Lundy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1287)|
| 0:21:30| Second by Commissioner Daley to move forward without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1290)|
| 0:21:34| Commissioner Lundy, you pulled this from consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1294)|
| 0:21:36| Would you like to speak to it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1296)|
| 0:21:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1297)|
| 0:21:38| I pulled this because I received a few emails from the community stating that once that term was up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1298)|
| 0:21:44| the sign was supposed to come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1304)|
| 0:21:46| So I just want to get more clarity on that before we move on with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1306)|
| 0:21:51| Thank you, Commissioner Lundy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1311)|
| 0:21:52| Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1312)|
| 0:21:53| I had a question from last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1313)|
| 0:21:55| Did we look back and see negotiating-wise is this the best deal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1315)|
| 0:22:00| Can you speak to the microphone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1320)|
| 0:22:04| From last time I was asking, is this the best deal that we can get?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1324)|
| 0:22:08| I believe that question was asked of Mr. Myers or Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1328)|
| 0:22:14| Either of you guys want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1334)|
| 0:22:21| I think Perry is coming down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1341)|
| 0:22:36| Yes, Perry Benchoff, Knox County Finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1356)|
| 0:22:39| We worked pretty hard to negotiate with them and research how much a good lease cost and benefit is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1359)|
| 0:22:49| Lamar reached out to us and provided their revenue stream for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1369)|
| 0:22:54| And the research that we found was that you would get about 18% to 20% of expense-revenue ratio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1374)|
| 0:23:05| Lamar is getting way ñ well, let me rephrase that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1385)|
| 0:23:11| It's an expense-revenue ratio, but Lamar is getting 45.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1391)|
| 0:23:18| Their expense-to-ratio is 45%, which I'm not explaining that very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1398)|
| 0:23:24| But the revenue that they're getting versus the expense that they cost is basically much lower than what normally we'd get,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1404)|
| 0:23:33| you would get, they would get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1413)|
| 0:23:35| So we considered it an extremely good deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1415)|
| 0:23:39| I'm kind of surprised Lamar even wants to keep the sign because of how much it costs them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1419)|
| 0:23:43| So in our research, it found that this is the best probability deal we can get, if that makes any sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1423)|
| 0:23:54| I own several billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1434)|
| 0:23:57| I know I personally get more for mine than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1437)|
| 0:24:00| So I've not ñ you know, Lamar is one that rents from me as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1440)|
| 0:24:06| They rent the billboard on my property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1446)|
| 0:24:08| I know I get almost double.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1448)|
| 0:24:10| That's why it brought this to my attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1450)|
| 0:24:13| Well, it's usually based on how much revenue they can get versus the cost that it costs them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1453)|
| 0:24:20| And what they sent us and what they provided us was they receive about somewhere around $7,000 a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1460)|
| 0:24:29| and it costs them $3,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1469)|
| 0:24:32| So it's almost a 45% ratio that they're losing money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1472)|
| 0:24:38| See what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1478)|
| 0:24:41| It's all about location, true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1481)|
| 0:24:43| You know, it just seems like as far as what they're getting and what it costs us, it's about the best deal we can come up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1483)|
| 0:24:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1493)|
| 0:24:55| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1495)|
| 0:24:56| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1496)|
| 0:24:58| Perry, in our discussions, I had requested that if we go forward with this billboard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1498)|
| 0:25:05| that if they want to convert this to an electronic billboard, that they would have to do that prior ñ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1505)|
| 0:25:11| they'd have to come to us prior to taking that action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1511)|
| 0:25:14| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1514)|
| 0:25:15| Is that amended in the contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1515)|
| 0:25:17| That clause is in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1517)|
| 0:25:18| We added that if that ever were to come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1518)|
| 0:25:21| I don't know if that's even ñ I talked to Myers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1521)|
| 0:25:25| We'll go back and take a look and see if that was even allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1525)|
| 0:25:28| If by ordinance they could even have an electronic billboard here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1528)|
| 0:25:31| But we did add the clause just for safeguard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1531)|
| 0:25:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1534)|
| 0:25:37| Commissioner Bussler, and then back to Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1537)|
| 0:25:40| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1540)|
| 0:25:41| How long has that billboard been there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1541)|
| 0:25:45| Oh, I couldn't tell you how far back it goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1545)|
| 0:25:48| Has it been more than 15 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1548)|
| 0:25:50| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1550)|
| 0:25:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1551)|
| 0:25:54| Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1554)|
| 0:25:55| Do we have an option for a smaller contract instead of the 10-year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1555)|
| 0:25:59| Because they're not making any more billboard space in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1559)|
| 0:26:02| so the value of it is only going to go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1562)|
| 0:26:05| We talked to them about, you know, whether or not the 10-year ñ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1565)|
| 0:26:08| we just felt like 10 years was reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1568)|
| 0:26:16| Are there any further questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1576)|
| 0:26:20| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1580)|
| 0:26:21| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1581)|
| 0:26:22| But I agree with the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1582)|
| 0:26:24| If there was some kind of an agreement that the billboard would come down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1584)|
| 0:26:30| after the original 10 years had expired, then I would support that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1590)|
| 0:26:36| because if we made a commitment to the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1596)|
| 0:26:38| we should follow through with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1598)|
| 0:26:40| I'm just not aware of that agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1600)|
| 0:26:43| It's the first time I've heard of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1603)|
| 0:26:46| That's what the emails that I received today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1606)|
| 0:26:50| That was from the emails that I received today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1610)|
| 0:26:53| That was the agreement that once that term was up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1613)|
| 0:26:56| they were going to take it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1616)|
| 0:26:58| Well, all I've got to go by is the lease agreement that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1618)|
| 0:27:01| and it's not in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1621)|
| 0:27:02| So I don't know what it's about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1622)|
| 0:27:04| So I guess we have a week to figure that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1624)|
| 0:27:06| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1626)|
| 0:27:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1628)|
| 0:27:10| If you could supply those, that would help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1630)|
| 0:27:12| The community is working on getting their documents together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1632)|
| 0:27:16| That would be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1636)|
| 0:27:17| We could use that negotiating one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1637)|
| 0:27:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1640)|
| 0:27:25| The motion before us is to move forward without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1645)|
| 0:27:28| That motion by Commissioner Lundy and second by Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1648)|
| 0:27:31| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1651)|
| 0:27:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1653)|
| 0:27:34| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1654)|
| 0:27:35| That will move forward to the non-consent agenda next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1655)|
| 0:27:39| Madam Clerk, next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1659)|
| 0:27:40| Item number 39 is a resolution approving the execution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1660)|
| 0:27:44| of an interlocal project agreement with the City of Knoxville, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1664)|
| 0:27:48| for the development of plans for an acute care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1668)|
| 0:27:51| and behavioral health facility to be located| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1671)|
| 0:27:54| at 1515 St. Mary Street, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1674)|
| 0:27:58| Resolution 902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1678)|
| 0:28:02| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1682)|
| 0:28:06| Motion to move forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1686)|
| 0:28:09| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1689)|
| 0:28:10| I have a motion to move forward with no recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1690)|
| 0:28:12| by Commissioner Schoonmaker with a second by Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1692)|
| 0:28:16| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1696)|
| 0:28:20| Does Knox County Finance want to take this opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1700)|
| 0:28:24| to tell us all the good things with this project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1704)|
| 0:28:39| Good evening, gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1719)|
| 0:28:42| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1722)|
| 0:28:43| I'm Knox County Mayor Glenn Jacobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1723)|
| 0:28:45| Caldwell just said you can go over the good things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1725)|
| 0:28:47| and I'll tell you how much it's going to cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1727)|
| 0:28:49| So we think this is a wonderful opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1729)|
| 0:28:56| to help fill a need in our community along with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1736)|
| 0:29:00| We have talked about acquiring this piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1740)|
| 0:29:05| the old women's facility in the St. Mary's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1745)|
| 0:29:08| And with the mental health issues that we face| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1748)|
| 0:29:13| and the team that's been put together here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1753)|
| 0:29:20| we think this is really also a unique opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1760)|
| 0:29:22| because we have all three of our hospital systems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1762)|
| 0:29:25| are being involved as well as Helen Ross with NAB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1765)|
| 0:29:27| and the city and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1767)|
| 0:29:30| And we've also approached the state about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1770)|
| 0:29:32| and there seems to be a lot of interest on their part as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1772)|
| 0:29:35| This would be a little different than what we have seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1775)|
| 0:29:39| in, say, with the VHUC and that with this model,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1779)|
| 0:29:43| anyone can utilize this facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1783)|
| 0:29:46| It's not just people that are currently in police custody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1786)|
| 0:29:52| So we think it's a great opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1792)|
| 0:29:55| This is a need in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1795)|
| 0:29:58| And in the end, it will actually end up saving all of us money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1798)|
| 0:30:03| as well as helping to address a serious issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1803)|
| 0:30:07| in Knox County and the surrounding region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1807)|
| 0:30:09| So Chris is going to talk about the rest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1809)|
| 0:30:17| You probably recall that as we talked about ARP funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1817)|
| 0:30:21| a couple of months ago, this was one of the items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1821)|
| 0:30:25| City and county are both paying to purchase this facility from ARP funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1825)|
| 0:30:30| And so that is positive from that standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1830)|
| 0:30:33| It definitely fits that model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1833)|
| 0:30:36| And then we're working on the operating piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1836)|
| 0:30:40| We think that we would close if approved by commission and council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1840)|
| 0:30:44| The closing date for this facility would be November the 3rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1844)|
| 0:30:49| And then we would start to look to redevelop this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1849)|
| 0:30:55| And that's what we, as the mayor mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1855)|
| 0:30:59| had a conversation with the state about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1859)|
| 0:31:01| And so we're looking to see what options are there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1861)|
| 0:31:06| and then looking to maybe do a pilot program with the state as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1866)|
| 0:31:12| to see how this program works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1872)|
| 0:31:15| If you talk to the hospitals, they will tell you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1875)|
| 0:31:19| these individuals who are coming to their emergency rooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1879)|
| 0:31:23| would then be diverted to here, which frees up bed space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1883)|
| 0:31:27| saves them money, also saves the state money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1887)|
| 0:31:31| because that's not being billed to TennCare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1891)|
| 0:31:33| So we do think, in talking with the state and the hospitals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1893)|
| 0:31:36| this is a win-win-win for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1896)|
| 0:31:39| And so we will bring forth, if approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1899)|
| 0:31:43| an operating budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1903)|
| 0:31:46| And we think it would probably take about 18 months to 24 months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1906)|
| 0:31:49| to renovate this facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1909)|
| 0:31:52| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1912)|
| 0:31:56| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1916)|
| 0:31:58| Chris said some of the things I wanted to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1918)|
| 0:32:02| This concept and the cooperation of this model is greatly needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1922)|
| 0:32:10| A facility like this, where a patient can go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1930)|
| 0:32:15| and get the direct care they need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1935)|
| 0:32:17| will both benefit the patient and do a great service to our ERs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1937)|
| 0:32:22| This is a model that I fully endorse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1942)|
| 0:32:25| and think will make a big difference in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1945)|
| 0:32:28| in the way we're able to treat people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1948)|
| 0:32:30| and to free up bed spaces in our ERs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1950)|
| 0:32:34| Thank you, Mayor, for looking into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1954)|
| 0:32:36| Thank the city for being willing to go along with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1956)|
| 0:32:40| And thank the hospitals for cooperating to make this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1960)|
| 0:32:45| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1965)|
| 0:32:46| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1966)|
| 0:32:48| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1968)|
| 0:32:50| Mr. Caldwell, could you outline how this facility will differ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1970)|
| 0:32:56| in sort of big, grander scope than the BHUC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1976)|
| 0:32:59| which is obviously a program we're already supporting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1979)|
| 0:33:03| The thing about it like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1983)|
| 0:33:04| the BHUC is really jail diversion, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1984)|
| 0:33:08| And so this will not be that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1988)|
| 0:33:10| So ultimately, this has an urgent care component to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1990)|
| 0:33:14| So if somebody in the community has been hurt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=1994)|
| 0:33:20| or has some sort of injury, they can come there and get help, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2000)|
| 0:33:26| And why that acute care piece is also important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2006)|
| 0:33:30| is if somebody comes there with a mental health issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2010)|
| 0:33:34| they get to go through that process first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2014)|
| 0:33:36| so we can make sure that all protocols are going through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2016)|
| 0:33:40| And then they get diverted to what we call kind of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2020)|
| 0:33:44| the front of the house would be more acute care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2024)|
| 0:33:47| back of the house is more behavioral health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2027)|
| 0:33:49| And so we get to help those patients there for up to three days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2029)|
| 0:33:55| and find them their next stop along the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2035)|
| 0:34:00| where it could be a litany of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2040)|
| 0:34:02| Maybe they get the help that they need there and get to go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2042)|
| 0:34:07| But ultimately, the acute care piece is important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2047)|
| 0:34:14| because it allows you to do everything in one location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2054)|
| 0:34:19| Do you ever foresee an opportunity that the BHUC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2059)|
| 0:34:24| since they're essentially similar services in two different scenarios,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2064)|
| 0:34:28| that they might come together in this facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2068)|
| 0:34:31| and optimize the resources and the investment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2071)|
| 0:34:35| We've discussed that, and ultimately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2075)|
| 0:34:37| I think when our conversations with the state happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2077)|
| 0:34:40| they kind of like that model of maybe combining everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2080)|
| 0:34:43| But we're going into it now thinking it's just acute care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2083)|
| 0:34:47| and the non-jail piece of behavioral health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2087)|
| 0:34:52| And then we can see how it would look along the way with those services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2092)|
| 0:34:57| And so the advantage to this location as well is it's centrally located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2097)|
| 0:35:03| It's close to 40. It's close to 275.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2103)|
| 0:35:06| It can be used by adjoining counties if need be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2106)|
| 0:35:10| And so, you know, we feel that it's really advantageous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2110)|
| 0:35:15| And it's important to understand where the hospitals are coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2115)|
| 0:35:20| Individuals with mental health that come to the ER are taking up space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2120)|
| 0:35:25| and they stay for like three to five days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2125)|
| 0:35:29| And that bill is charged to TennCare a lot of the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2129)|
| 0:35:33| And so if you're the state, it's a savings there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2133)|
| 0:35:37| And then, frankly, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2137)|
| 0:35:41| those folks aren't getting the care that they need at the hospitals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2141)|
| 0:35:44| That's not what the hospitals are there for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2144)|
| 0:35:47| So, you know, they just kind of are filling a gap right now as best they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2147)|
| 0:35:53| But these folks need different services than they're able to acquire at the hospitals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2153)|
| 0:35:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2159)|
| 0:36:00| And one just quick final question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2160)|
| 0:36:01| Could you outline the baseline economics?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2161)|
| 0:36:04| I know using federal funding, but still, what are the resources being allocated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2164)|
| 0:36:11| and do we know long-term both the build-out and then the long-term operating capital?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2171)|
| 0:36:16| So what we think we can, we're going to, if approved, we'll buy this facility for $1.9 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2176)|
| 0:36:28| We think the build-out and renovation is about $2.6 million, so a total of $4.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2188)|
| 0:36:39| One of our challenges with the BHUC was we got a lot of money to get it open and get it built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2199)|
| 0:36:46| but we didn't have any sustaining funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2206)|
| 0:36:49| So will Knox County look to add this to our budget for sustainable funding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2209)|
| 0:36:54| So the hospitals have talked about actually diverting some of what goes to indigent care right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2214)|
| 0:37:00| into this facility because it will help them alleviate the strain on the emergency departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2220)|
| 0:37:06| One thing that we are going to work with and have talked with the state about is the TennCare revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2226)|
| 0:37:16| and the revenue for uninsured at-risk patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2236)|
| 0:37:19| So those are things that we have to work through at the state, but the state does see, as Chris talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2239)|
| 0:37:25| the state does see benefit because we're going to be diverting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2245)|
| 0:37:28| It's cheaper for folks here, so that actually will save the state money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2248)|
| 0:37:33| So that's something we still have to negotiate, but they see the logic in doing it this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2253)|
| 0:37:38| Sorry, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2258)|
| 0:37:39| So to your point, though, there is still a gap that you will see in city and county budgets once the center is open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2259)|
| 0:37:49| And so we've got to figure out what that amount is because it's going to depend on what our answer is from the governor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2269)|
| 0:37:57| So we made a pitch for capital and operating, both mayors did, and the hospitals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2277)|
| 0:38:05| and he wants more information and we're providing him that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2285)|
| 0:38:09| Do you have an estimate for the operating cost in general?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2289)|
| 0:38:13| We think the operating cost is about $4.8 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2293)|
| 0:38:21| Annual?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2301)|
| 0:38:22| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2302)|
| 0:38:23| And ultimately when you take the indigent care piece and the pieces that the mayor talked about, that brings that cost down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2303)|
| 0:38:37| We think the operating gap that we're asking the state to help in that and sharing that with is about $1.2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2317)|
| 0:38:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2325)|
| 0:38:46| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2326)|
| 0:38:47| Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2327)|
| 0:38:49| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2329)|
| 0:38:50| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2330)|
| 0:38:52| I agree, too, that this is a great opportunity for our community and, of course, the location is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2332)|
| 0:38:58| And talking about the location, it's just when you look at the Google Maps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2338)|
| 0:39:02| it's just the building and then the surrounding parking around the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2342)|
| 0:39:07| It's not the adjacent parking to the west that's part of that same block or area or whatever you want or track of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2347)|
| 0:39:16| It's the building and just the parking around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2356)|
| 0:39:18| It's the 1.6 acres?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2358)|
| 0:39:20| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2360)|
| 0:39:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2361)|
| 0:39:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2362)|
| 0:39:23| And then, well, can I, I want to say something and I want to amend my.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2363)|
| 0:39:33| Commissioner Durrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2373)|
| 0:39:35| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2375)|
| 0:39:37| Mayor and Director Caldwell, we have had a chance to sit down and talk about the specific censuses in District 2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2377)|
| 0:39:43| and I am so thankful that this is being brought forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2383)|
| 0:39:47| But I just wanted to make it clear that this is not a long-term behavioral health facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2387)|
| 0:39:54| This is more, for lack of a better term, a landing facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2394)|
| 0:39:58| Give these people immediate treatment and then figure out where to go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2398)|
| 0:40:02| Yeah, that's exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2402)|
| 0:40:07| You know, the issue that we have is the facilities around the state, if they don't have a bed open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2407)|
| 0:40:13| we don't have any place for someone to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2413)|
| 0:40:16| So this is a short-term facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2416)|
| 0:40:18| Hopefully, in many cases, it will be for folks that can say they're off, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2418)|
| 0:40:23| they've stopped taking their meds and they can level out pretty quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2423)|
| 0:40:26| They're in crisis and they can level out pretty quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2426)|
| 0:40:29| But we hit that choke point because we don't have any place to send folks if they don't have a bed available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2429)|
| 0:40:35| And what happens a lot of times is they end up at the detention center, which is not what we want at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2435)|
| 0:40:39| So, no, this is not a long-term facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2439)|
| 0:40:41| Right, and the bottom floor is that urgent care piece, which is actually a great need right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2441)|
| 0:40:48| in that location, since we did lose the hospital for that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2448)|
| 0:40:53| So I am very excited that this is being brought forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2453)|
| 0:40:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2456)|
| 0:40:59| Thank you, Commissioner. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Thank you, Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2459)|
| 0:41:01| Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2461)|
| 0:41:02| Yes, I wanted to amend my motion to move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2462)|
| 0:41:07| Is the second agreeable to amend the motion, Commissioner Ward, to approve rather than move forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2467)|
| 0:41:14| So we have a motion to approve by Commissioner Schoonmaker, the second by Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2474)|
| 0:41:21| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2481)|
| 0:41:23| All in favor, please say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2483)|
| 0:41:25| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2485)|
| 0:41:27| Resolution is approved and moves to the consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2487)|
| 0:41:31| Madam Clerk, Item 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2491)|
| 0:41:35| This is a resolution approving a contract in the total amount of $1,181,062 with Emily Horn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2495)|
| 0:41:43| to develop the Knox County Comprehensive Plan, including a detailed analysis of land use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2503)|
| 0:41:49| transportation, and parks and recreation, Resolution 903.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2509)|
| 0:41:55| Chair, will you entertain a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2515)|
| 0:41:57| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2517)|
| 0:41:58| Motion to approve by Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2518)|
| 0:42:01| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2521)|
| 0:42:02| Commissioner Biggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2522)|
| 0:42:05| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2525)|
| 0:42:11| Commissioner Bussler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2531)|
| 0:42:12| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2532)|
| 0:42:14| I've got a question about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2534)|
| 0:42:16| Do we have full control of our parks now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2536)|
| 0:42:20| Anyone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2540)|
| 0:42:28| Is there anyone from Parks that would like to speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2548)|
| 0:42:31| Mr. Mack is here, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2551)|
| 0:42:43| Mr. Mack, I want to thank you for coming up here and talking to us about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2563)|
| 0:42:46| but we talked before at one time about the control of the parks, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2566)|
| 0:42:50| that we've had these contracts out where we lease them out or sublease them out to other people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2570)|
| 0:42:56| that operates the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2576)|
| 0:42:57| Do we have complete control of those now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2577)|
| 0:43:00| Sir, with regards to complete control, I don't think we ever lost control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2580)|
| 0:43:07| I think those user agreements just allow providers, they're really provider agreements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2587)|
| 0:43:12| and they allow different community organizations to provide use ports on behalf of the Parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2592)|
| 0:43:18| and Recreation Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2598)|
| 0:43:19| So the actual facilities themselves, they still belong to the Parks and Recreation Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2599)|
| 0:43:25| Oh, I understand that, but in the past, before you were on here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2605)|
| 0:43:29| we had situations where some of the parks were controlled by one person that got,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2609)|
| 0:43:33| they started in October leasing them out, and then they would, to use those parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2613)|
| 0:43:38| they didn't use them all the time, but to use them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2618)|
| 0:43:40| you had to go back to those people that had those leases, and they would sublease it out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2620)|
| 0:43:45| which was costing the community twice as much as what it would if we had complete control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2625)|
| 0:43:51| And that's what I was talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2631)|
| 0:43:52| Do we have those lease agreements to where we can control them more now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2632)|
| 0:43:57| Yes, sir, we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2637)|
| 0:43:58| Since I've been on board, and we're actually still updating those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2638)|
| 0:44:01| but those lease agreements now are actual user agreements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2641)|
| 0:44:05| and there's clear documentation in the user agreements with regards to how the parks should be used,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2645)|
| 0:44:11| and we're going further, taking a step further to clarifying that those community parks are for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2651)|
| 0:44:16| in fact, the community and not for the people that are providing the service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2656)|
| 0:44:23| so that a, I'll give you an example, a mother and daughter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2663)|
| 0:44:27| or a mother and son or a father and son can go out to any one of the parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2667)|
| 0:44:31| and go out and play catch, play ball, do whatever that they would like to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2671)|
| 0:44:36| We are still updating some of the lease agreements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2676)|
| 0:44:39| so as they come to the end of their term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2679)|
| 0:44:43| we're making those changes to provider agreements instead of user agreements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2683)|
| 0:44:47| and there's a big difference between the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2687)|
| 0:44:49| Mr. Mack, I do appreciate you being here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2689)|
| 0:44:51| and I'm glad that you got a hold of the problem and taken care of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2691)|
| 0:44:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2694)|
| 0:44:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2695)|
| 0:44:56| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2696)|
| 0:44:57| Thank you, Mr. Mack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2697)|
| 0:44:58| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2698)|
| 0:44:59| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2699)|
| 0:45:00| Could we have Mr. Snowden maybe give us an overview of the comprehensive plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2700)|
| 0:45:06| when you anticipate the start, how long it will take,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2706)|
| 0:45:12| and what are some of the components that will be involved in this comprehensive plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2712)|
| 0:45:17| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2717)|
| 0:45:18| I'd be glad to, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2718)|
| 0:45:19| Jim Snowden, 205 West Baxter Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2719)|
| 0:45:23| Yeah, one of the things, this is something very exciting for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2723)|
| 0:45:25| It's the last general plan that this essentially, this is kind of retitled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2725)|
| 0:45:30| It's a little bit different than what we've done in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2730)|
| 0:45:32| It's been a land use plan only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2732)|
| 0:45:34| In this case, we've added the transportation plan and the parks plan to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2734)|
| 0:45:39| but this will replace a plan that is currently dated 2003, so it's 18 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2739)|
| 0:45:45| Very super excited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2745)|
| 0:45:46| What we've tried to do is to listen to what we hear at MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2746)|
| 0:45:49| what we hear at rezonings every month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2749)|
| 0:45:51| and kind of mold all those concerns into what ultimately this plan will ultimately ask you guys to adopt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2751)|
| 0:45:59| which is a new general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2759)|
| 0:46:01| Probably looking at about 18 months to complete the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2761)|
| 0:46:05| A lot of community engagement will be out in your all's communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2765)|
| 0:46:09| talking to your constituents, I think, somewhere in the neighborhood of about 20 different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2769)|
| 0:46:13| actually, in-person meetings and some virtual meetings to get the pulse of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2773)|
| 0:46:18| Running different scenarios as far as how we grow, like we're growing now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2778)|
| 0:46:24| This is what that's going to, the ramifications of that and the various alternatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2784)|
| 0:46:28| So it's something we're super excited about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2788)|
| 0:46:30| We've got a great team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2790)|
| 0:46:32| We went through a robust selection process and have Kimley Horn on this firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2792)|
| 0:46:38| They were one of the six firms that we looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2798)|
| 0:46:41| We feel like they're, by far and away, the best firm for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2801)|
| 0:46:45| We've got representation from the mayor's office, my office at Engineering and Public Works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2805)|
| 0:46:51| Knoxville-Knox County Planning, and Joe Mack, obviously, with Parks and Recreation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2811)|
| 0:46:57| That master plan has got some age on it, so we wanted to take this as an opportunity to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2817)|
| 0:47:04| Just something we're super excited about and something that we think is going to bid our community for many, many years to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2824)|
| 0:47:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2832)|
| 0:47:15| Thank you, Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2835)|
| 0:47:17| Commissioner Schoonmaker, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2837)|
| 0:47:19| Commissioner Smith is next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2839)|
| 0:47:22| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2842)|
| 0:47:24| Chris, Jim, I need your help with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2844)|
| 0:47:27| Jim, is this going to look at growth plan, too, or is it just going to be general plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2847)|
| 0:47:33| I'm sorry, Commissioner, I didn't hear you real well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2853)|
| 0:47:35| Are they going to look at growth plan, or is it just going to be general plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2855)|
| 0:47:38| It will be both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2858)|
| 0:47:40| One of the things that we want to do as part of this procedure is obviously to look at that growth policy map, which is the rural area specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2860)|
| 0:47:50| Obviously, that rural area, that's 20 years old, so what was rural then is not necessarily rural now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2870)|
| 0:47:57| One of the functions of this plan will actually be to really more or less draw the boundaries of that map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2877)|
| 0:48:05| and then actually hopefully reconvene the growth policy committee at some point through this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2885)|
| 0:48:12| and hopefully have adoption of not only this plan but a new growth policy plan at the accumulation of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2892)|
| 0:48:20| Okay, and when can we expect this plan to be presented to commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2900)|
| 0:48:26| This, I would assume, probably sometime probably spring of 2023.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2906)|
| 0:48:34| It's going to be a pretty long process just because of the amount of work, but probably 15 to 18 months would be something I would anticipate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2914)|
| 0:48:43| I know back several years ago whenever Chairman Nystrom was chairman, we allocated $400,000 to revisit our general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2923)|
| 0:48:52| At $1.2 million, where is the other $800,000 coming from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2932)|
| 0:48:57| That's a good question. I probably should have spoken to that sooner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2937)|
| 0:49:02| $500,000 of this is coming from local transportation planning dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2942)|
| 0:49:09| Through the TPO, we were able to secure $500,000 of local planning dollars, so essentially half the plan is being funded with federal money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2949)|
| 0:49:19| The other half approximately is that money that we previously secured as well as a designation from the fiscal year that we just now left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2959)|
| 0:49:29| Chris, I don't think he needed you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2969)|
| 0:49:34| Thank you, Commissioner Smith. Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2974)|
| 0:49:38| I just want to state for the record I absolutely support this. It is long overdue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2978)|
| 0:49:43| I did look at the proposal and appreciate the fact that there are two people that seem to have Knoxville roots that have lived here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2983)|
| 0:49:54| one I believe actually previously worked in county government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2994)|
| 0:49:59| and so the people that will be leading this are people that understand our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=2999)|
| 0:50:05| So I'm very, very pleased to see that factor in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3005)|
| 0:50:11| Thank you, Commissioner Hill. Commissioner Bussler, your light is on. Did you want to speak again? Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3011)|
| 0:50:16| Are there any further questions or discussion? Thank you, Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3016)|
| 0:50:22| The motion is to approve, I believe. Is that correct, Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3022)|
| 0:50:29| All those in favor, please say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3029)|
| 0:50:32| Any opposed? Motion carries. This moves to the consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3032)|
| 0:50:38| Madam Clerk, next item please. On page 9, item number 43,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3038)|
| 0:50:43| consideration of an ordinance of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee to repeal and replace Knox County Code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3043)|

| 0:50:58| This is Ordinance No. 0-96-4-101, adopted May 28, 1996.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3058)|

| 0:51:18| This is on first reading, Ordinance 101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3078)|
| 0:51:24| Commissioner Daley? Motion to senate with no recommendation. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3084)|
| 0:51:28| We have a motion by Commissioner Daley with a second by Commissioner Schoonmaker to move forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3088)|
| 0:51:34| Is there any discussion? Yes, Mr. Chairman. I'd like to invite Sheriff Spangler up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3094)|
| 0:51:41| I've invited Sheriff Spangler, Richard Majors, he's not here, and I have Wayne with KKB who will be coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3101)|
| 0:51:49| Sheriff Spangler's got some update on our Environmental Codes Officer, and then maybe Drew's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3109)|
| 0:51:55| Drew's got some comments. He's more than welcome, but first, Sheriff Spangler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3115)|
| 0:52:01| Thank you, Commissioner Chairman. Thank you, Commission. Tom Spangler, Knox County Sheriff, 400 Main Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3121)|
| 0:52:07| Before I get there, let me first say that I ask each of you to keep in your prayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3127)|
| 0:52:14| I don't know if you know or not, but we lost my Executive Secretary over the weekend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3134)|
| 0:52:22| and so I ask that you keep her and her family in your prayers, if you will, and the family of Knox County Sheriff's Office as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3142)|
| 0:52:31| With that being said, Commissioner, we now have Lieutenant Tom Walker, who is now our Environmental Officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3151)|
| 0:52:38| who will be a liaison with the Highway Department as well to be able to handle any illegal dumping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3158)|
| 0:52:47| to be able to put, I guess what you'd say, more teeth into the bite when people are out here doing dumping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3167)|
| 0:52:54| whether it be illegal side or whether it be on the roadway or what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3174)|
| 0:53:00| I think with that being put into that position right now, I think it's going to help us out with what we've talked about as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3180)|
| 0:53:09| So that has already been put in stone now, and we're ready to go with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3189)|
| 0:53:15| So I just want to let everybody know that we have somebody that is dedicated for doing those particular items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3195)|
| 0:53:25| And the only requirement I requested is he has to hate litter worse than I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3205)|
| 0:53:30| I'm not sure there is anybody that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3210)|
| 0:53:33| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3213)|
| 0:53:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3214)|
| 0:53:35| And also this officer will be a codes officer too, that when the Codes Department has trouble with dirty lots or anything like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3215)|
| 0:53:43| they can go out with him also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3223)|
| 0:53:46| Next is Wayne from Keep Knox Beautiful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3226)|
| 0:53:50| I'll let him pronounce his last name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3230)|
| 0:53:53| Alana is out of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3233)|
| 0:53:54| She couldn't be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3234)|
| 0:53:55| Thanks, Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3235)|
| 0:53:56| Wayne Kokritz, 223 East Anderson, Knoxville, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3236)|
| 0:54:02| I'm going to fight you on who hates litter more, challenge you to come on out with me once a week and pick some up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3242)|
| 0:54:09| and we'll see who wins at the end of that hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3249)|
| 0:54:12| So here supporting and representing Keep Knoxville Beautiful as a member of their board of directors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3252)|
| 0:54:18| and wanted to first say thank you for your continued support of some of the funding and grant money that keeps us going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3258)|
| 0:54:26| As you guys know, and that litter is – I kind of break it into three things, prevention, mitigation, and enforcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3266)|
| 0:54:34| and Keep Knoxville Beautiful can do two out of those three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3274)|
| 0:54:36| and that's education with the prevention side of it as well as litter cleanups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3276)|
| 0:54:41| But the enforcement piece is something that we don't have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3281)|
| 0:54:44| and so anything that said we can put a little bit more teeth into the bite of the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3284)|
| 0:54:50| and code is really great and greatly appreciated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3290)|
| 0:54:53| So with that, I'd like to throw our support behind the proposed changes in the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3293)|
| 0:54:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3299)|
| 0:55:02| Drew, do you got anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3302)|
| 0:55:07| This litter ordinance is going to be repealed and replaced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3307)|
| 0:55:10| and just like the sheriff and Wayne just said, this is going to put teeth into our ordinance now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3310)|
| 0:55:16| We don't really have any teeth in the Knox County ordinance, so it's going to be repealed and replaced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3316)|
| 0:55:22| Ninety percent of it, I'm guessing here – not guessing, but I'm pretty sure I know that –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3322)|
| 0:55:26| 90 percent of it is just copying the state litter laws is what we're doing, copying what the state is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3326)|
| 0:55:33| So when our environmental officer goes out there, he can cite by the state ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3333)|
| 0:55:38| which has more teeth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3338)|
| 0:55:40| It's a criminal offense, and it's the different steps and different layers there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3340)|
| 0:55:44| If someone throws out a Coke can, it's $50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3344)|
| 0:55:48| They can pay the $50 citation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3348)|
| 0:55:50| They can go to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3350)|
| 0:55:52| They go to court, and they lose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3352)|
| 0:55:54| It's court costs plus 40 hours of litter pickup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3354)|
| 0:55:58| You throw out a refrigerator or a mattress, it could be up to $2,500 fine, 120 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3358)|
| 0:56:04| I'd have to look at it and see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3364)|
| 0:56:06| So really it's giving this environmental officer some teeth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3366)|
| 0:56:10| He's going to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3370)|
| 0:56:12| If I've got private property and we had one out in the 8th and 7th District, I think not too long ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3372)|
| 0:56:17| they were dumping on advanced property, if they can get pictures and everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3377)|
| 0:56:23| we've got an environmental officer now that can go out there, put together the records,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3383)|
| 0:56:29| and cite them to court, and hopefully they'll be smart enough to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3389)|
| 0:56:35| that if they go to court, they're going to get punished worse than if they don't go ahead and pay the bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3395)|
| 0:56:42| Judge Jackson, General Sessions IV, will be hearing this, and he is willing and able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3402)|
| 0:56:52| We've just got to get it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3412)|
| 0:56:56| All fees, Richard Major, I had him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3416)|
| 0:57:00| I guess he forgot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3420)|
| 0:57:02| The fee schedule is broken down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3422)|
| 0:57:05| Tremendous on what the fee schedule will be for all citations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3425)|
| 0:57:12| That being said, if anybody's got any questions, I'll try to answer them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3432)|
| 0:57:16| I've got the law department plus Jill over there, so I hope you all will consider and vote for this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3436)|
| 0:57:24| Thank you, Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3444)|
| 0:57:25| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3445)|
| 0:57:27| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3447)|
| 0:57:28| I do have a question for Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3448)|
| 0:57:31| If you could look at page 4 of the ordinance, it's section 26-130, penalty for violation of article.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3451)|
| 0:57:45| I notice that we've reduced the penalty from $1,000 to $500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3465)|
| 0:57:52| If you could address that, and is it possible that when we state by a penalty of up to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3472)|
| 0:58:02| that would be just changed to by a penalty of $500?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3482)|
| 0:58:10| Actually, thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3490)|
| 0:58:13| I did see that, and I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3493)|
| 0:58:15| I did not get with the law department on this, but I don't know if we really need that one in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3495)|
| 0:58:21| because if you look at the other starting with offense of mitigated criminal littering, section 26-123,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3501)|
| 0:58:34| it goes through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3514)|
| 0:58:35| That's what will be cited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3515)|
| 0:58:37| We've got 26-123.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3517)|
| 0:58:39| We've got mitigated criminal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3519)|
| 0:58:42| Then we've got criminal littering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3522)|
| 0:58:44| Then we've got aggravated criminal littering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3524)|
| 0:58:46| There's three different types of littering there under the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3526)|
| 0:58:50| Mr. Law Director, do we, that penalty for violations, I believe that's in our ordinance now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3530)|
| 0:58:56| That's our ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3536)|
| 0:58:58| It's General Sessions Court jurisdictional limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3538)|
| 0:59:01| I believe it's $500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3541)|
| 0:59:03| Is it $500?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3543)|
| 0:59:05| So what about the state ordinance that says they can be fined up to $2,500?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3545)|
| 0:59:12| Not in Sessions Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3552)|
| 0:59:15| Not in Sessions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3555)|
| 0:59:17| If there's an appeal or it goes up at a higher court, they can fine more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3557)|
| 0:59:28| Currently, I think I've seen some signs posted in Knox County that it says, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3568)|
| 0:59:34| like under the underpasses and things that violation for dumping is a $1,000 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3574)|
| 0:59:41| So would those signs now be changed then to $500?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3581)|
| 0:59:49| Law Director's shaking his head yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3589)|
| 0:59:53| But that is $500 per offense per day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3593)|
| 1:00:00| We will, the sign department will be creating new signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3600)|
| 1:00:04| But that's something I just found out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3604)|
| 1:00:08| Thank you for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3608)|
| 1:00:09| Is that $1,000, we can't go $1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3609)|
| 1:00:13| Our limit's $500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3613)|
| 1:00:14| Correct, Law Department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3614)|
| 1:00:16| It's my understanding when we've been working on this, Sessions Court jurisdiction doesn't have the ability to pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3616)|
| 1:00:24| charged fines in addition to over $500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3624)|
| 1:00:28| I will research that and report back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3628)|
| 1:00:32| If that can be for aggravation or any of these other aggravating circumstances, they can be higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3632)|
| 1:00:38| I'm not sure as I sit here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3638)|
| 1:00:40| I remember just saying $500 because that's the jurisdictional limit at General Sessions Court where Environmental Court is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3640)|
| 1:00:48| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3648)|
| 1:00:51| We have a motion from Commissioner Daley with a second by Commissioner Schoonmaker to move this forward to first reading without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3651)|
| 1:00:59| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3659)|
| 1:01:01| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3661)|
| 1:01:02| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3662)|
| 1:01:04| That motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3664)|
| 1:01:06| Before we move to the discussion items, it's been brought to my attention that there were a couple of additions that were not read in the non-consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3666)|
| 1:01:17| I'm going to look at some of my former chairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3677)|
| 1:01:20| Those added items, do they need to be read outside of the consent agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3680)|
| 1:01:26| I think a to-be-add is pulled off consent automatically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3686)|
| 1:01:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3691)|
| 1:01:32| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3692)|
| 1:01:40| We added them to the agenda, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3700)|
| 1:01:42| They were added to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3702)|
| 1:01:44| And then they were left in consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3704)|
| 1:01:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3706)|
| 1:01:48| Additionally, anything that was added was pulled off of consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3708)|
| 1:01:51| I don't believe there's any rule that says if it's added, it can't be on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3711)|
| 1:01:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3716)|
| 1:01:57| I'd like to make a motion to pull 24 off consent because that's one we skipped that I have some questions about after looking at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3717)|
| 1:02:04| I would just be safe then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3724)|
| 1:02:06| I'd just pull them both off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3726)|
| 1:02:08| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3728)|
| 1:02:09| Is there any objection to having the clerk read 24 and 31 as non-consent items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3729)|
| 1:02:17| I would think that we would need a motion and a vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3737)|
| 1:02:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3740)|
| 1:02:21| We have a motion by Commissioner Jay then to pull those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3741)|
| 1:02:22| Do I have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3742)|
| 1:02:23| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3743)|
| 1:02:24| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3744)|
| 1:02:26| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3746)|
| 1:02:27| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3747)|
| 1:02:28| Madam Clerk, please read item 24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3748)|
| 1:02:31| This is on page 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3751)|
| 1:02:33| This is a resolution approving a piggyback agreement with Verno LLC doing business as a Verno advisors for information technology,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3753)|
| 1:02:44| strategic consulting and support services, resolution 302.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3764)|
| 1:02:49| I'll make a motion to move forward without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3769)|
| 1:02:53| I have a motion to move forward without recommendation by Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3773)|
| 1:02:56| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3776)|
| 1:02:58| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3778)|
| 1:02:59| Second by Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3779)|
| 1:03:01| Commissioner Jay, you have the floor, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3781)|
| 1:03:03| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3783)|
| 1:03:04| I don't know if anyone is still here from the Sheriff's Department, but this one I'm trying to better understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3784)|
| 1:03:13| It's a piggyback contract on an agreement with City of Maryville, which is pretty common with other types of contracts we approve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3793)|
| 1:03:26| but there is no fiscal note on it and there's no scope of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3806)|
| 1:03:29| So I'll try to inquire before next week to find out what it is we're contracting because it has virtually no details as to what it has to do with Knox County and Knox County Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3809)|
| 1:03:40| So I'll just do my best to find out for next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3820)|
| 1:03:44| Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3824)|
| 1:03:45| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3825)|
| 1:03:46| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3826)|
| 1:03:48| Commissioner Jay, I think they also do work for Blount County as well as the City of Maryville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3828)|
| 1:03:54| but I know that in talking to the folks in Blount County, they were very impressed with this vendor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3834)|
| 1:04:07| I think Zach could probably give you the details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3847)|
| 1:04:10| Zach, do you want to jump in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3850)|
| 1:04:13| I'm just not super comfortable approving something that has no scope of work and no fiscal note that is for another city that has literally not the word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3853)|
| 1:04:22| The words Knox County barely show up in the entire thing, so it seems rather odd to not have at least some details, even if the vendor is a good one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3862)|
| 1:04:32| Is this the folks that I'm thinking of that do work for Blount County then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3872)|
| 1:04:36| Zach Webb, Knox County IT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3876)|
| 1:04:38| Just to clarify, this is the Sheriff's Department contract. I didn't present this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3878)|
| 1:04:42| Yes, it is the same organization that we saw in Blount County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3882)|
| 1:04:47| Do you have any details or should I just refer that to the Sheriff's Department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3887)|
| 1:04:50| I don't have any details specifically to this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3890)|
| 1:04:53| I'm aware of the City of Maryville contract, the agreement that they have there, and also the Blount County contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3893)|
| 1:04:59| But as far as what wasn't provided under that, I didn't submit that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3899)|
| 1:05:03| I'll just inquire directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3903)|
| 1:05:05| I certainly can give you anything you need on our side, but I don't know what they didn't submit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3905)|
| 1:05:12| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3912)|
| 1:05:15| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3915)|
| 1:05:17| So Zach, does the Sheriff's Department come to you and ask what is your opinion of this and what type of strategic services are they seeking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3917)|
| 1:05:27| Sure. So again, I defer to Captain Darnell, Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3927)|
| 1:05:32| But yes, we have spoken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3932)|
| 1:05:34| And the connection there between the two, they are seeking services to augment some of their services around their email system upgrade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3934)|
| 1:05:48| And that's what the scope of this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3948)|
| 1:05:50| But the specifics you would need to flesh out with the Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3950)|
| 1:05:53| Yes, but we have spoken about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3953)|
| 1:05:55| Okay. Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3955)|
| 1:05:59| Thank you, Mr. Webb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3959)|
| 1:06:01| We have a motion to move forward without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3961)|
| 1:06:04| If there's a proper second, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3964)|
| 1:06:07| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3967)|
| 1:06:08| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3968)|
| 1:06:09| Motion will move forward to next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3969)|
| 1:06:13| Madam Clerk, item 31, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3973)|
| 1:06:16| This is on page 6, a resolution approving a contract with Highway Markings, Inc. for the provision of pavement marking materials and road striping services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3976)|
| 1:06:26| Resolution 407.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3986)|
| 1:06:30| I have a motion to approve by Commissioner Biggs. Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3990)|
| 1:06:34| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3994)|
| 1:06:36| We have a second by Commissioner Hill. Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=3996)|
| 1:06:41| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4001)|
| 1:06:43| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4003)|
| 1:06:44| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4004)|
| 1:06:46| That resolution moves to the consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4006)|
| 1:06:50| Madam Clerk, next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4010)|
| 1:06:53| This is item number 44, discussion item, schools litigation tax receipts, what debt it is being paid on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4013)|
| 1:07:03| Commissioner Bussler, sir, you have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4023)|
| 1:07:06| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4026)|
| 1:07:08| The reason why I'm looking at this litigation tax, I was going back through and seeing what it was originally set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4028)|
| 1:07:15| I think it was set up back in 2008 or 2009 where you added a $50 charge on to litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4035)|
| 1:07:23| So when you file litigation, the person that's filing it would pay that $50 fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4043)|
| 1:07:30| And then this was to be used under this ordinance was under safety and security, was how the ordinance read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4050)|
| 1:07:39| And for some reason, it got split between Knox County and schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4059)|
| 1:07:45| And one of the little things they got in there was something about paying on debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4065)|
| 1:07:49| And I was wondering what you consider debt is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4069)|
| 1:07:54| And I'm not wanting to take it away or anything like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4074)|
| 1:07:58| But if it is a debt and it goes in the general fund for debt, should it be specific or should it be just a check written out that says, well, we got a lot bill this time that was $200,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4078)|
| 1:08:13| So we were at part of that amount out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4093)|
| 1:08:15| Now, this is not a little amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4095)|
| 1:08:18| This last year, it wasn't that much because of COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4098)|
| 1:08:23| It was like the school's part was like about 600,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4103)|
| 1:08:26| And the county gets that almost the same amount beers in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4106)|
| 1:08:31| Usually in the last years before COVID was about eight hundred and eighty eight thousand dollars that we received from the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4111)|
| 1:08:39| And the schools received the same amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4119)|
| 1:08:42| And I was just wondering, it got put in there to pay off debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4122)|
| 1:08:48| And I know that we have some loans and things out there that interest interest only back years ago that was put in there on our debt level that we have here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4128)|
| 1:08:58| And we can't pay on those loans for a little while yet to principals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4138)|
| 1:09:04| So the principal is still out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4144)|
| 1:09:06| But this past little bit, we only got about six hundred and seven thousand dollars of this litigation tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4146)|
| 1:09:14| We see this coming up the horizon of what it's going to cost us and inflation and other things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4154)|
| 1:09:23| And I was wondering if it would be more specific if we did require a specific way that this money would be used to pay on a specific debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4163)|
| 1:09:33| So I wanted to know what people felt about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4173)|
| 1:09:36| It goes into general funds and general population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4176)|
| 1:09:40| Is it being spent on a real debt? What I call if you buy something that causes a debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4180)|
| 1:09:48| If you don't buy something and you have operating costs, is that debt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4188)|
| 1:09:55| So it was put in there, the school system, to pay all the debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4195)|
| 1:09:59| And I just wondered, is it going to general fund?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4199)|
| 1:10:02| Does it pay on a specific debt? Or does it go in there and just pay on just whatever the bill's coming?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4202)|
| 1:10:10| And I didn't know if we put it in that way to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4210)|
| 1:10:14| Mr. Caldwell, would you like to speak to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4214)|
| 1:10:17| So the $50 on the lit tax, as the ordinance is written, is broken down $25 for school debt and $25 for courtroom security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4217)|
| 1:10:30| The $25 for school debt is transferred to general purpose school fund, which is then applied to debt service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4230)|
| 1:10:41| So Ron has to use that money to service any bonded debt, which is debt for 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4241)|
| 1:10:49| Simple as that. That's all it can be used for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4249)|
| 1:10:51| The other $25 stays in the general fund and is earmarked for courtroom security,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4251)|
| 1:10:58| which could be sheriff officers, bailiffs, PBA officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4258)|
| 1:11:04| All that is earmarked for courtroom security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4264)|
| 1:11:07| So that's specific items. Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4267)|
| 1:11:10| But the other $25 has to go on a 20-year debt, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4270)|
| 1:11:15| It's paid. It is recorded in the general fund and transferred to school, to general purpose school fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4275)|
| 1:11:23| which Ron then appropriates to the debt service fund, which services that debt for that year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4283)|
| 1:11:32| Is that like for buildings or cars or what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4292)|
| 1:11:35| It's all 20-year bonded debt, so it has to be anything that has a 20-year useful life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4295)|
| 1:11:39| So if we have a bond come up, it has to go toward that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4299)|
| 1:11:42| That's what that money is used for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4302)|
| 1:11:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4303)|
| 1:11:44| It can't be used for operating. It can't be used for short-term debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4304)|
| 1:11:48| We use it for what we call bonded debt, which is 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4308)|
| 1:11:54| So it came in on 2008, so we're still paying out. We've got, what, seven more years. It has 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4314)|
| 1:12:02| Well, I think ultimately if you're Ron, he's not earmarking it towards a certain debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4322)|
| 1:12:09| He has 30, let's say he spends $20 million a year on bonded debt, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4329)|
| 1:12:18| So he's just allocating that $600,000 to pay for debt service, which is long-term debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4338)|
| 1:12:27| It's not a specific bond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4347)|
| 1:12:29| It's just general GO bonds and his portion of those payments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4349)|
| 1:12:36| So you use that in your budget format, too, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4356)|
| 1:12:39| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4359)|
| 1:12:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4360)|
| 1:12:41| If it goes up or it goes down, we don't have to make up a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4361)|
| 1:12:44| There's a maintenance of effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4364)|
| 1:12:46| That money is a transfer to the general purpose school fund, and transfers are not counted in maintenance of effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4366)|
| 1:12:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4375)|
| 1:12:58| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4378)|
| 1:12:59| Is that 25 and 25 breakdown, is that mandated by the state?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4379)|
| 1:13:03| It's mandated by an ordinance that the county commission passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4383)|
| 1:13:07| Okay, but it's not mandated by the state then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4387)|
| 1:13:10| I think it's approved by the state to go up to a certain amount, but how it was approved was by this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4390)|
| 1:13:17| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4397)|
| 1:13:21| Thank you, Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4401)|
| 1:13:24| Madam Clerk, Item 45.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4404)|
| 1:13:28| Discussion item regarding why is natural growth automatically given to the budget to the schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4408)|
| 1:13:36| Commissioner Bussler, this was also your item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4416)|
| 1:13:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4418)|
| 1:13:40| We have natural growth, and the schools get 62 cents out of every sales tax dollar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4420)|
| 1:13:47| I mean not 62, 71 cents out of every sales tax dollar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4427)|
| 1:13:52| and it gets a total of about 62 cents out of all sales tax, all taxes, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4432)|
| 1:13:59| And what I was looking at here, they naturally get the growth, because that's state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4439)|
| 1:14:06| They get that growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4446)|
| 1:14:08| And at the end of the year, what we do, and I'm just looking at what their coming economics are like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4448)|
| 1:14:18| when we have money left over on that natural growth, say it's $10 million in natural growth in sales tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4458)|
| 1:14:24| they would get out of that, you know, $7 million out of that automatically goes in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4464)|
| 1:14:33| And say the next year you get that same $10 million plus it grows even more, you get that percentage on that other tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4473)|
| 1:14:41| We don't have to apply it to the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4481)|
| 1:14:44| Why I'm asking that is we have a maintenance of effort that we have to pay for the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4484)|
| 1:14:50| Just saw in a paper the other day that there was 15 states in Tennessee right now cannot get food materials for schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4490)|
| 1:14:59| no matter how much they pay for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4499)|
| 1:15:02| So that's an additional cost that we have to look at, the inflation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4502)|
| 1:15:08| And the maintenance of effort in that it says we are by law pay what we can afford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4508)|
| 1:15:18| And we really haven't increased taxes in a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4518)|
| 1:15:24| And if it gets to the point that the sales tax is not growing, sales tax dollars not growing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4524)|
| 1:15:30| even the tax on property is not growing, then we've got a budgetary problem here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4530)|
| 1:15:37| So and we've given them a budget that we've got to maintain or try to maintain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4537)|
| 1:15:43| And if we say we can't afford it, they'll say, well, why don't you raise taxes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4543)|
| 1:15:50| And I'm one of these people that you don't raise taxes, you spend what you get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4550)|
| 1:15:55| Chris has done a great job since I've been in commission office here of predicting how things will grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4555)|
| 1:16:03| And he's normally on the lower end of how we do grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4563)|
| 1:16:09| What bothers me is by automatically putting that into the budget and giving it to the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4569)|
| 1:16:16| we're raising our maintenance of effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4576)|
| 1:16:19| One of these days it's going to come back and really bite us because they get the money anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4579)|
| 1:16:25| And I was wondering when we look at budgets, do we think about those things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4585)|
| 1:16:30| Do you understand what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4590)|
| 1:16:32| Have I made myself completely clear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4592)|
| 1:16:35| Because they're going to get the money anyway because it's done by state mandate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4595)|
| 1:16:39| that that's what they're going to get out of the sales tax dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4599)|
| 1:16:43| But yet we take that money and we add it to the budget, which raises maintenance of effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4603)|
| 1:16:48| And I don't think that's fair for the taxpayers that we do that all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4608)|
| 1:16:55| Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4615)|
| 1:16:56| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4616)|
| 1:16:59| Director Caldwell, correct me if I'm wrong, but what we're talking about is where it's at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4619)|
| 1:17:05| and we can't go below it, I think, if I'm following Commissioner Bussler correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4625)|
| 1:17:09| So even if we drop below that amount of students, the natural growth is already at that level, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4629)|
| 1:17:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4637)|
| 1:17:18| So let me try to explain where we get sales tax and natural growth and how all that comes into play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4638)|
| 1:17:32| There were three referendums on the ballot, one in the 60s, one in the 70s, one in the 80s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4652)|
| 1:17:38| that dictates the amount of sales tax that have to go to schools, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4658)|
| 1:17:43| And it comes out to 72 percent out of every tax dollar in the city and the county must go to schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4663)|
| 1:17:51| So by that referendum on the ballot, we've got to give that money to schools, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4671)|
| 1:17:58| because it's a referendum on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4678)|
| 1:18:00| If you want to change it, change the referendum, but it's a referendum on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4680)|
| 1:18:04| So if we think the budget's going to come in at X amount, that has to go to schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4684)|
| 1:18:11| Maintenance of effort, so the school's budget this past year, $549 million, that's not maintenance of effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4691)|
| 1:18:21| That full amount, you don't have to hit that full amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4701)|
| 1:18:25| All maintenance of effort is is local recurring revenue, permits, fees, fines, and taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4705)|
| 1:18:32| That's all it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4712)|
| 1:18:33| It's not the total amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4713)|
| 1:18:34| It's not transfers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4714)|
| 1:18:36| It's not use of fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4716)|
| 1:18:37| It's not one-time money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4717)|
| 1:18:39| It's recurring dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4719)|
| 1:18:41| So it's not the total amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4721)|
| 1:18:44| The only way we can not give, let me rephrase it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4724)|
| 1:18:49| You have to give sales tax to schools because of the referendum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4729)|
| 1:18:54| You could pull back property tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4734)|
| 1:18:58| You could say sales tax is going to go up $10 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4738)|
| 1:19:02| I'm going to pull $0.08 from property tax from the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4742)|
| 1:19:06| You could because you're still hitting maintenance of effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4746)|
| 1:19:10| But every department in the county gets natural growth, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4750)|
| 1:19:18| So the sheriff gets natural growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4758)|
| 1:19:20| Parks and Rec gets natural growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4760)|
| 1:19:22| Snowden gets natural growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4762)|
| 1:19:24| Everybody gets natural growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4764)|
| 1:19:26| The school's inflationary amount is higher than us, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4766)|
| 1:19:32| It's 62% of our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4772)|
| 1:19:33| So everything that goes up in schools is going to be more than it is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4773)|
| 1:19:37| That's a bigger percentage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4777)|
| 1:19:40| But you could not remove that sales tax piece from schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4780)|
| 1:19:45| because it was a referendum on the ballot in three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4785)|
| 1:19:47| That's why the city is required to give $0.72 to the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4787)|
| 1:19:54| It's a referendum on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4794)|
| 1:19:56| The only way you could do this is to pull back on property tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4796)|
| 1:20:02| Ever since I have been in county finance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4802)|
| 1:20:09| schools have always got natural growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4809)|
| 1:20:12| And so there was one year in 08 when we were not able to meet maintenance of effort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4812)|
| 1:20:21| okay, in 08 or 09.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4821)|
| 1:20:23| No county system in the state could hit it, and we were held armless, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4823)|
| 1:20:29| And so I don't worry about not hitting maintenance of effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4829)|
| 1:20:34| because if something bad happens, as an example, FY21, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4834)|
| 1:20:41| I bet if you looked at our maintenance of effort, we didn't hit it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4841)|
| 1:20:44| I bet if Ron and I looked at maintenance of effort from a budgetary standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4844)|
| 1:20:49| we were below what we were the year before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4849)|
| 1:20:54| Now, it ended up not being that way, but from a budgetary standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4854)|
| 1:20:57| we did not hit maintenance of effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4857)|
| 1:21:00| The state did not penalize us for that, did not, but COVID, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4860)|
| 1:21:05| And so it happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4865)|
| 1:21:06| Now, what ends up happening is Ron listened to me too much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4866)|
| 1:21:10| and we lowered sales tax way too much, and we ended up in a great spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4870)|
| 1:21:15| But ultimately, you really can't touch sales tax because it was passed by referendum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4875)|
| 1:21:21| You could only adjust, really, the property tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4881)|
| 1:21:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4886)|
| 1:21:27| Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4887)|
| 1:21:28| Maybe I didn't make myself clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4888)|
| 1:21:31| I know the schools get that money, period, because it's by law or referendum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4891)|
| 1:21:37| What I'm saying is when we get to the end of the year and we close the books out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4897)|
| 1:21:43| and we've got money left over, sometimes we add that to the budget of the schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4903)|
| 1:21:50| or other departments, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4910)|
| 1:21:52| So this may help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4912)|
| 1:21:54| Maintenance of effort is budget-based.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4914)|
| 1:21:56| It's not actual-based.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4916)|
| 1:21:59| It's just not based off actual, right, Ron?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4919)|
| 1:22:02| It's based off budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4922)|
| 1:22:03| And so it's only based on what you budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4923)|
| 1:22:05| I'm not saying that it's right, but they don't base it off actual expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4925)|
| 1:22:11| They base it on how you budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4931)|
| 1:22:15| So when we get to the end of this fiscal year, this year, Ron's – I shouldn't say Ron.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4935)|
| 1:22:22| I feel like it's his money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4942)|
| 1:22:24| Schools' fund balance jumps by what, Ron?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4944)|
| 1:22:28| Twenty million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4948)|
| 1:22:30| Because we underestimated sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4950)|
| 1:22:32| The state don't care what actuals are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4952)|
| 1:22:35| They only care what budget is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4955)|
| 1:22:37| Now, I can argue that they're wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4957)|
| 1:22:39| I'm not going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4959)|
| 1:22:40| But ultimately, it's budget-based.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4960)|
| 1:22:45| And again, they make their budget, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4965)|
| 1:22:48| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4968)|
| 1:22:49| They make their budget, and then we work to that budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4969)|
| 1:22:53| School board, the school administration works with us to propose a budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4973)|
| 1:23:01| It goes to school board, then it comes to county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4981)|
| 1:23:09| Commissioner Jay, your light is on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4989)|
| 1:23:12| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4992)|
| 1:23:13| Mr. Bessler, if you'd like to speak again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4993)|
| 1:23:15| One discussion that we've never had, going down this path and exploring taxing structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=4995)|
| 1:23:25| where money is allocated to, what their allocated resources are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5005)|
| 1:23:28| and we've never really had the discussion because so many referendums were set long before any of us showed up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5008)|
| 1:23:34| is exploring the idea of a full tax structure redo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5014)|
| 1:23:40| I mean, ultimately, you could separate the waters and have the school board have direct taxing authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5020)|
| 1:23:47| to the community that they serve and be held accountable to the people that vote them in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5027)|
| 1:23:52| and separate that completely from Knox County's operating budget altogether.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5032)|
| 1:23:56| And there are many other examples of that in different parts of the country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5036)|
| 1:23:59| that Knox County operates off of its growth and its infrastructure and its taxes and people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5039)|
| 1:24:04| and the school board has direct taxing authority and has held account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5044)|
| 1:24:08| Right now, we're in a structure where certainly the two cooperating groups work together to try to find a middle ground,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5048)|
| 1:24:15| but in our current scenario, we could go back to the old days where the school system says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5055)|
| 1:24:22| you don't give us enough money and blames it all on us, and then we'd go back and forth and back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5062)|
| 1:24:26| So, you know, just adding that to the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5066)|
| 1:24:29| I don't think anybody's ever talked about is this the right structure that we have for our own tax authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5069)|
| 1:24:38| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5078)|
| 1:24:39| Commissioner Bussard, did you have anything to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5079)|
| 1:24:42| That has been discussed even at the state level through the TCCA when I first got in there about the individual taxing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5082)|
| 1:24:50| so it has been discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5090)|
| 1:24:52| I'm not trying to change anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5092)|
| 1:24:54| I'm just, I was not under the understanding of the maintenance of effort part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5094)|
| 1:24:59| If we budget it, then we have a maintenance of effort problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5099)|
| 1:25:04| If we don't budget and they get it anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5104)|
| 1:25:12| and it doesn't put us legally in a situation where we've got a budget that we may have to raise taxes on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5112)|
| 1:25:21| my understanding is we have to keep that maintenance of effort going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5121)|
| 1:25:25| Correct, Chris?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5125)|
| 1:25:27| We have to maintain that maintenance of effort, and I'm not arguing that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5127)|
| 1:25:32| No, sure. I get you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5132)|
| 1:25:33| No, and I'm just, I'm glad that we got to discuss that it's budget-based, not actual-based.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5133)|
| 1:25:40| By state law, you have to meet maintenance of effort, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5140)|
| 1:25:45| And so local recurring revenue, because what the state doesn't want you to do is supplant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5145)|
| 1:25:51| They don't want you to use the state BEP money to offset your revenue so you can put it somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5151)|
| 1:25:58| That's all the state's trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5158)|
| 1:26:00| And so I think now, and if I'm wrong, Ron, stop me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5160)|
| 1:26:03| I think it's been twice we've not hit maintenance of effort since we've been here, and we've never been penalized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5163)|
| 1:26:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5173)|
| 1:26:16| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5176)|
| 1:26:19| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5179)|
| 1:26:21| When I saw this on the agenda, I took just a quick look at state statutes, and correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5181)|
| 1:26:28| but there's only six entities that were required for a maintenance of effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5188)|
| 1:26:35| One is the education, sheriff, public libraries, the election commission, register, excuse me, the property assessor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5195)|
| 1:26:47| and the highway department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5207)|
| 1:26:50| There is for sure sheriff and highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5210)|
| 1:26:53| The election commission is a little different in the sense that it looks at it from an election cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5213)|
| 1:27:02| So, like, our budget may go down one year than the previous year because one's a presidential election and one's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5222)|
| 1:27:10| So if you're ever trying to look at an election commission budget, you'll see ebbs and flows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5230)|
| 1:27:17| but it's because of the election cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5237)|
| 1:27:20| And sometimes we get state money reimbursed or city money reimbursed for city elections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5240)|
| 1:27:25| but there are certain elections that the county has to pay for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5245)|
| 1:27:30| But to your point, there are multiple maintenance of efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5250)|
| 1:27:33| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5253)|
| 1:27:36| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5256)|
| 1:27:38| Chris, just to refresh our minds, what is the penny rate on the property tax for the schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5258)|
| 1:27:44| Penny on the tax rate right now brings about $1.3 million, $1308 to be exact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5264)|
| 1:27:51| What is the penny amount?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5271)|
| 1:27:53| The penny, they get 80 pennies, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5273)|
| 1:27:57| I think 89 is going to the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5277)|
| 1:27:59| I think it's 80 for schools and it's 43 for debt service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5279)|
| 1:28:05| If that equals 212, then I did really good there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5285)|
| 1:28:08| You're pretty close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5288)|
| 1:28:10| Why do we call it natural growth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5290)|
| 1:28:12| To me, that's a misnomer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5292)|
| 1:28:14| There's nothing natural about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5294)|
| 1:28:15| It's recruited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5295)|
| 1:28:16| It's focused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5296)|
| 1:28:17| It's targeted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5297)|
| 1:28:18| If it were natural, all counties would grow at the same rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5298)|
| 1:28:21| I think we undersell the people that work to grow Knox County when we just call it natural growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5301)|
| 1:28:26| Well, probably natural growth was a word used by some accountant one time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5306)|
| 1:28:31| and it just kind of stuck because us accountants are simple-minded and that's how things work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5311)|
| 1:28:37| It would be my guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5317)|
| 1:28:38| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5318)|
| 1:28:40| I don't know why they call it natural growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5320)|
| 1:28:44| Ultimately, you could call it whatever you want to call it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5324)|
| 1:28:52| I call it the BEP killer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5332)|
| 1:28:54| Well, BEP, so I was thinking about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5334)|
| 1:28:57| We're fortunate, but it also hurts us that we live in a county that sees growth every year on property tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5337)|
| 1:29:06| You go to your meetings with state commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5346)|
| 1:29:12| I bet you a lot don't see growth on property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5352)|
| 1:29:16| We see consistent growth on property tax revenue without rate increases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5356)|
| 1:29:22| I mean, we're going up and up and up, and so that's growth and that's positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5362)|
| 1:29:32| On the same token, sales tax continues to go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5372)|
| 1:29:38| Like, sales tax for July this year compared to July last year is up 20 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5378)|
| 1:29:47| Twenty percent July over July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5387)|
| 1:29:50| I bet Ron saw that coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5390)|
| 1:29:53| I mean, it's quite amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5393)|
| 1:29:55| And so we're just seeing lots of growth in revenue, and so it's not a bad thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5395)|
| 1:30:02| Listen, because our revenue is growing on property tax, it allows us to do a lot of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5402)|
| 1:30:09| We talk about behavioral health today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5409)|
| 1:30:11| If we didn't have growth there, we couldn't do some of the things that we do, and so we're fortunate in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5411)|
| 1:30:18| We do, though, because we're able to see growth, we do get hurt in BEP because of that, there's no doubt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5418)|
| 1:30:25| And so, you know, we hear that the governor is going to look at BEP, and so we'll see what that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5425)|
| 1:30:33| That leads me to my next question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5433)|
| 1:30:35| The governor has said he's going to, I guess, form a committee or a council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5435)|
| 1:30:40| or some organization to look at updating the BEP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5440)|
| 1:30:45| What will the administration's role, the school's role, and commission's role?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5445)|
| 1:30:50| Will we have any input into this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5450)|
| 1:30:54| I want to try to get Ron on the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5454)|
| 1:30:58| That's a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5458)|
| 1:30:59| You know, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5459)|
| 1:31:01| You know, if they ask for our help, sure we'll help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5461)|
| 1:31:05| Ron, have you heard anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5465)|
| 1:31:06| Bob, I mean, I've not heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5466)|
| 1:31:08| You know, we've heard that they're going to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5468)|
| 1:31:11| What does that look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5471)|
| 1:31:13| We've often found that any time we look at BEP, it becomes urban versus rural,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5473)|
| 1:31:20| and any time that happens, we get hurt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5480)|
| 1:31:23| And so it's not a Republican versus Democrat thing at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5483)|
| 1:31:27| It's urban versus rural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5487)|
| 1:31:29| So when they start looking at BEP, the first thing I would say is let's fully fund BEP 2.0 first, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5489)|
| 1:31:36| That was never fully funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5496)|
| 1:31:37| That would be a start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5497)|
| 1:31:39| But let's see what the governor has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5499)|
| 1:31:42| But I don't think that there's nobody that I've talked to that has an idea of what's coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5502)|
| 1:31:48| I thought Ron was either getting up to leave or I guess he's coming down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5508)|
| 1:31:51| He may have some new news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5511)|
| 1:31:54| I've read certain things that said if BEP 2.0 were fully funded, it might actually hurt us in the urban areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5514)|
| 1:32:01| But as always, you're exactly right, Chris, when it comes to how they split this up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5521)|
| 1:32:07| they're in their 90s, we're in our 40s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5527)|
| 1:32:13| Hello, Mr. McPherson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5533)|
| 1:32:14| How are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5534)|
| 1:32:15| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5535)|
| 1:32:16| Just want to add, everything Chris said is absolutely correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5536)|
| 1:32:19| The one thing that we do have some concerns with BEP reform simply because we really don't know what that's going to look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5539)|
| 1:32:29| The governor has formed committees across the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5549)|
| 1:32:35| Some of the chairs of those committees look to be folks from the private sector or non-profits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5555)|
| 1:32:42| don't really see a lot of the leadership so far from school districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5562)|
| 1:32:47| I'm not sure what these committees will look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5567)|
| 1:32:49| We haven't been contacted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5569)|
| 1:32:51| Hopefully we would be, but I don't know that we will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5571)|
| 1:32:54| One of the concerns we have on this BEP reform is the best way to help with BEP is for the state to have a larger pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5574)|
| 1:33:08| And so we do know that the governor has a heart for rural districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5588)|
| 1:33:16| Right now, Knox County, there's probably $70 million or more that is redirected from Knox County to other districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5596)|
| 1:33:26| We have about 6% of the students, 4.5% of the funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5606)|
| 1:33:32| So that's a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5612)|
| 1:33:35| Will this simply be a reallocation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5615)|
| 1:33:37| If so, it could actually hurt us if more is reallocated to the rural districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5617)|
| 1:33:46| Now, one thing that would help, I don't envision more taken away from the rural districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5626)|
| 1:33:53| And so the only way that would happen would be from some of the larger or metropolitan districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5633)|
| 1:33:59| That does scare me a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5639)|
| 1:34:03| The best thing that could happen is that the BEP total pool would increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5643)|
| 1:34:07| The problem there is there's really just a couple of ways to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5647)|
| 1:34:12| One would be tax increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5652)|
| 1:34:15| I think the governor's on record that he's not in favor of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5655)|
| 1:34:19| The other would be if the state were to reallocate their funding from some of their other areas or programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5659)|
| 1:34:26| Now, that I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5666)|
| 1:34:29| Again, I don't know what that would be, which programs he would take from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5669)|
| 1:34:33| So there's just a lot of unknowns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5673)|
| 1:34:36| We haven't received any specifics because I don't think the state has landed on anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5676)|
| 1:34:40| They have formed these committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5680)|
| 1:34:42| All of this discussion is going to occur, but where this leads, I really can't predict at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5682)|
| 1:34:49| Ron, Chris, either one of you, how many years in a row has the state run a fairly significant surplus?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5689)|
| 1:34:56| Oh, they've got a huge fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5696)|
| 1:34:59| No, I mean how many years in a row have they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5699)|
| 1:35:02| Because you speak of either increased taxes or allocate from some other form of funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5702)|
| 1:35:09| Why don't they just allocate more to schools with the excess funding they already have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5709)|
| 1:35:13| I would say, similar to us, they've probably not ran a deficit since 2008, 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5713)|
| 1:35:19| Probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5719)|
| 1:35:20| That would be my guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5720)|
| 1:35:22| Anyway, I'm getting off base here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5722)|
| 1:35:24| And, Chris, you mentioned the great recession of 2008 or whatever we called it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5724)|
| 1:35:29| and it kind of gets back to some of the questions I think Commissioner Busler may have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5729)|
| 1:35:34| or this may help to answer some of the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5734)|
| 1:35:38| That year, sales tax for the last several years has been just great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5738)|
| 1:35:43| Hey, this is wonderful for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5743)|
| 1:35:45| There's never a guarantee that's going to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5745)|
| 1:35:47| And so in 2008, the economy kind of fell off the cliff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5747)|
| 1:35:51| And so with the school system, we had a $10 million or more deficit in sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5751)|
| 1:35:57| And so we didn't run back to Chris or the county and say, hey, you need to bail us out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5757)|
| 1:36:04| We used our own fund balance to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5764)|
| 1:36:07| Hey, it's great when everything's going for us, when the economy's going well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5767)|
| 1:36:12| When the economy's not going well, if that ever happens, then you kind of see the opposite effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5772)|
| 1:36:18| So it's wonderful now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5778)|
| 1:36:21| It has been for the last several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5781)|
| 1:36:23| We're just kind of at the mercy of the economy, though, when we rely so much on sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5783)|
| 1:36:28| That's why the superintendent says, Tennessee, if we can just keep winning, because people get happier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5788)|
| 1:36:35| And people spend more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5795)|
| 1:36:36| It's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5796)|
| 1:36:39| So, yeah, there's a lot of good that comes with it, but then there's also a downside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5799)|
| 1:36:43| Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5803)|
| 1:36:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5804)|
| 1:36:45| Question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5805)|
| 1:36:46| I'll make it quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5806)|
| 1:36:47| Ron, while you're up here, I'm trying to understand the BEP formula and how it's put forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5807)|
| 1:36:51| Is taking into consideration the amount of students also in that formula that we have in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5811)|
| 1:36:58| And since the federal mandate is by Judge Greer, I know that just between September 24th and October 8th, nearly 500 students have left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5818)|
| 1:37:08| So is that going to impact our funding coming up next year with the reduction of students?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5828)|
| 1:37:12| Or will we still be at that ceiling and it won't go below that just because of that mandate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5832)|
| 1:37:16| That's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5836)|
| 1:37:17| So we had a reduction in enrollment last year because of COVID, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5837)|
| 1:37:25| Whether folks were going homeschooling or private schools or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5845)|
| 1:37:29| We weren't the only one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5849)|
| 1:37:30| That was a dynamic experience by districts all across the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5850)|
| 1:37:34| And so what the state did is rather than provide Knox County schools and other districts that have experienced this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5854)|
| 1:37:44| rather than providing the growth, it was kind of a hold harmless, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5864)|
| 1:37:48| So it was a hold harmless provision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5868)|
| 1:37:51| Basically, they kept us at that enrollment level where we were the year before so that we weren't harmed by that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5871)|
| 1:37:58| So I don't know how long that would be in effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5878)|
| 1:38:02| Obviously, COVID, I think you could lay all of this at the feet of COVID and where the state might go, we don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5882)|
| 1:38:09| But, yeah, if we are funded, it's based on enrollment, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5889)|
| 1:38:16| And then the thing that also makes it a bit more difficult for Knox County is the state uses this fiscal capacity index| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5896)|
| 1:38:24| to where you have this formula that's equitable for all the districts except at the bottom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5904)|
| 1:38:30| Then they adjust it down because Knox County, they say, Knox County or Superior County or whoever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5910)|
| 1:38:37| has the ability to pay more of its share of education than, say, a poorer county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5917)|
| 1:38:43| And so, yeah, it follows the students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5923)|
| 1:38:47| But what the state's approach might be as we continue to battle through COVID, I really don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5927)|
| 1:38:53| The main reason I was wondering, that's because this is Knox County specifically that it's impacting right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5933)|
| 1:38:58| and seeing how they're going to some of our surrounding counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5938)|
| 1:39:01| That's why I was wondering that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5941)|
| 1:39:03| And if the numbers will increase, have you guys maybe thought about doing a biweekly update to the commission on the numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5943)|
| 1:39:10| maybe, of teachers that have left?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5950)|
| 1:39:13| I mean, and then this might be a little off subject,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5953)|
| 1:39:16| but I also got a question about the implementation for your substitute teachers have changed as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5956)|
| 1:39:21| and the hours of requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5961)|
| 1:39:23| I thought we were looking for more substitute teachers during this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5963)|
| 1:39:26| I may have. Can you clarify that, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5966)|
| 1:39:29| The specific amount of hours that you used to have to consume to be a substitute teacher was a specific amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5969)|
| 1:39:35| And now that's actually gone up from what I was told and it makes it harder to have substitutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5975)|
| 1:39:40| You may be, and I'm not sure, you may be referring to back several weeks ago we went through our list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5980)|
| 1:39:45| and we had a considerable number of people on the list that just simply weren't accepting jobs, right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5985)|
| 1:39:51| and hadn't been for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5991)|
| 1:39:53| And so what happens when we go through that list and we're trying to find subs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5993)|
| 1:39:57| there's just a lot of downtime when we contact these people and they repeatedly say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=5997)|
| 1:40:03| no, I'm not interested, and that's gone on for quite a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=6003)|
| 1:40:06| So what we did is we purged that list but said, hey, if you want to sub, we need you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=6006)|
| 1:40:11| Just let us know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=6011)|
| 1:40:13| So that may be what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=6013)|
| 1:40:15| That's probably it because I was told the hours were increased to meet that threshold,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=6015)|
| 1:40:19| so it might have been a little bit harder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=6019)|
| 1:40:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=6021)|
| 1:40:22| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=6022)|
| 1:40:24| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=6024)|
| 1:40:25| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=6025)|
| 1:40:27| I want to thank you for calling me this morning and talking to me a little bit about this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=6027)|
| 1:40:30| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=6030)|
| 1:40:32| Again, I've never had a problem getting information out of any of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=6032)|
| 1:40:35| I just thought it was a way of explaining to people when you get up here and Chris gets up here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=6035)|
| 1:40:41| and they talk about how this county is funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=6041)|
| 1:40:44| Now, in business, we don't work off of budgets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=6044)|
| 1:40:47| We work off of true receipts that come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=6047)|
| 1:40:50| When we have money in hand, then we can do something with it, expand or pay our people more, what business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=6050)|
| 1:40:57| But when you say you work off of a budget, it scares me to death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=6057)|
| 1:41:02| But anyway, I appreciate you coming up here and talking to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=6062)|
| 1:41:06| Again, I'm not trying to beat you over the head or anything like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=6066)|
| 1:41:10| I'm just trying to understand more about how it operates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=6070)|
| 1:41:14| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=6074)|
| 1:41:15| And us being a donor county does not sit well with me with the state because that $70 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=6075)|
| 1:41:21| we could do a lot more with it here than giving it to other counties since the state has the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=6081)|
| 1:41:26| Thank you again for your call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=6086)|
| 1:41:29| Thank you, Mr. McPherson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=6089)|
| 1:41:30| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=6090)|
| 1:41:33| Is there any further business to come before this work session of the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=6093)|
| 1:41:38| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=6098)|
| 1:41:40| Not business, just a reminder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=6100)|
| 1:41:43| Last month was a proclamation for a dysautonomia awareness pot, they call it, for the month of October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=6103)|
| 1:41:52| You'll recall, Ben, I told you all if you will come to the fundraiser that they are having at Hard Knocks Pizza| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=6112)|
| 1:41:59| this coming Sunday night, the 24th, from 4 to 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=6119)|
| 1:42:04| Now, if you want me to pay for your pizza, you need to be there around 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=6124)|
| 1:42:08| But that's provided you come and make a donation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=6128)|
| 1:42:11| So I hope you all will come to Hard Knocks Pizza on Hardin Valley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=6131)|
| 1:42:16| Thank you, Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=6136)|
| 1:42:18| A couple of reminders, Commissioner, one is next Monday night we will be hearing the honorary resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=6138)|
| 1:42:23| for Breast Cancer Awareness Month, and I would like to encourage all the commissioners to please wear pink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=6143)|
| 1:42:28| I have a week early, but I probably can dig some more up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=6148)|
| 1:42:32| And also, a reminder of our special session this Thursday, 5 p.m., in the small assembly room for redistricting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=6152)|
| 1:42:39| Do I have a motion to adjourn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=6159)|
| 1:42:42| Motion and a second, all those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=6162)|
| 1:42:44| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=6164)|
| 1:42:45| We are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211018?start=6165)|
