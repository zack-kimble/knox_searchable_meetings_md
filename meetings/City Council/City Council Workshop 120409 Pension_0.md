| 0:00:00| Councilman Brown? Here. Councilman Campin? Present. Councilman Della Vopi? Here. Councilman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=0)|
| 0:00:15| Grieve? Here. Councilman Palmer? Here. Vice Mayor Pavlis? Here. Councilman Saunders? Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=15)|
| 0:00:23| Councilman Wallace? Here. All right, we'll have the invocation by Councilman Brown and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=23)|
| 0:00:31| then the pledge by Councilman Saunders. My heads and a word of prayer. Dear Heavenly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=31)|
| 0:00:37| Father, we thank you for this, another beautiful day that you have made. Thank you for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=37)|
| 0:00:43| opportunity to come and participate in trying to do the best that we can in the governance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=43)|
| 0:00:50| of this city. We ask a special blessing upon each and every person assembled here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=50)|
| 0:00:57| We ask that you would go and be with those who are less fortunate. These and other blessings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=57)|
| 0:01:03| we ask in thy name. Amen. Amen. Please face the flag and render the salute. I pledge allegiance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=63)|
| 0:01:11| to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=71)|
| 0:01:17| nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. I will recognize Mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=77)|
| 0:01:28| O'Hara. Good evening, Council. Good morning. We are pleased to be here tonight to assist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=88)|
| 0:01:45| you in your deliberations on the pension plan. As I talked about, I can't even remember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=105)|
| 0:01:50| now when it was, when the task force came back and we told Council that we would start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=110)|
| 0:01:56| looking at some details, that we would start putting together some ideas so that to initiate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=116)|
| 0:02:01| discussion. And one of the things that we hope that the media and the public will remember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=121)|
| 0:02:07| is that we really have two issues here. One is how we fund the current plan that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=127)|
| 0:02:14| and the other one is how we move forward for future employees. And the, and really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=134)|
| 0:02:19| those are two different discussions. They interrelate, but if we're going to get on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=139)|
| 0:02:24| the ballot in November for any potential changes to the charter, then we really need to focus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=144)|
| 0:02:30| on what those changes might be. The current situation is something we'll be dealing with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=150)|
| 0:02:35| for a number of years. So what we have presented to you is we're going to get, y'all are going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=155)|
| 0:02:40| to get into detail about are some various scenarios based on certain assumptions, all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=160)|
| 0:02:45| of which can be questions and change. But there is one approach to start to talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=165)|
| 0:02:50| and get your arms around this topic. So that's all I have to say tonight. I'm looking forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=170)|
| 0:02:55| to the discussion. I know there'll be many more hours of discussion even after tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=175)|
| 0:03:00| Thank you. I'll recognize Bill Lyons. Thank you, Vice Mayor and Council. We're here as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=180)|
| 0:03:08| Mayor O'Hara said to, we put a lot on the table before you and to hopefully structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=188)|
| 0:03:15| the material in such a way that it can be very, bear a lot of fruit in your deliberations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=195)|
| 0:03:20| and your discussion. We're very much at this point, Council is then heavily involved and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=200)|
| 0:03:26| it's really up to us to find the right balance of administration and Council in handling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=206)|
| 0:03:31| this and working to support what Council does. And we want to be very sensitive to the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=211)|
| 0:03:36| that we recognize this is Council's workshop. We're here to facilitate your work in pursuing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=216)|
| 0:03:40| this issue. I'm just going to make a couple of remarks before turning it over to Alan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=220)|
| 0:03:45| who is going to go through in detail a lot of the material that we provided to you about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=225)|
| 0:03:52| a week ago. Just as a brief bit of background and as to what our approach has been and why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=232)|
| 0:03:58| it's been this way, as you know, the pension task force, Council's pension task force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=238)|
| 0:04:03| reported that their finding was that the pension in its present form was not sustainable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=243)|
| 0:04:08| At that point, they indicated that we should consider alternatives. They didn't have the capacity to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=248)|
| 0:04:16| flesh out those alternatives. And Mayor O'Hara, immediately following that report, told Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=256)|
| 0:04:22| and the public at Council meeting that we would pursue finding alternatives that ranged all the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=262)|
| 0:04:28| across the board of the way that you can deal with pensions, fully from a full defined benefit plan on one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=268)|
| 0:04:37| hand to a full defined contribution on the other with two or three or a few hybrid plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=277)|
| 0:04:43| combination plans that could put together in different ways in the middle. And that's what we have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=283)|
| 0:04:49| And you have had a lot of the material that outlines those plans, their benefits, their benefits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=289)|
| 0:04:57| and the way they're funded and where the risk is. And what we've thought useful in that narrative that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=297)|
| 0:05:02| provided to you last week, along with the tables and the presentation, was really to help what we thought was a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=302)|
| 0:05:09| good way to structure thinking about this, which is, number one, what are in fact the benefits that are in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=309)|
| 0:05:16| pension plan? What are they? What are the commitments to those? And how are those paid for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=316)|
| 0:05:22| The second thing, other than the level of benefits, and most important, really, we think, to help guide the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=322)|
| 0:05:30| discussion is once those benefits are laid out, what is the level of risk and who bears the risk, the market risk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=330)|
| 0:05:38| We're talking about market risk. Ranging on one hand to where in a pure defined benefit plan, the employee has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=338)|
| 0:05:44| certainty. The employee knows what his or her pension will be. That's set by a formula and can be computed as it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=344)|
| 0:05:54| now in the plan that we have. On the other end, but the city has no certainty. The city bears the risk because that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=354)|
| 0:06:04| funded by investments and market performance. So on the one end, the employee has certainty. The city bears 100| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=364)|
| 0:06:10| percent of the risk. Conversely, on the defined contribution plan, the city has certainty. That is, a certain amount is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=370)|
| 0:06:18| paid to the employee on a regular basis. That commitment is made. That's why it's called, obviously, defined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=378)|
| 0:06:25| contribution. And then the performance of that later, that risk is on the employee, and that will yield whatever the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=385)|
| 0:06:33| market does over a long period of time. And people can make general guidelines under which they're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=393)|
| 0:06:39| fund both for the city on defined benefit and guidelines for the employee on defined contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=399)|
| 0:06:44| But in one case, there's certainty for the employee. In the other case, there's certainty to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=404)|
| 0:06:49| We've also presented a number of hybrids that share that risk. There's not total certainty in either case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=409)|
| 0:06:55| The employee bears some risk based on what the market does. The city bears some risk to what its obligation to fund those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=415)|
| 0:07:02| plans based on what the market does. Mayor O'Hara has put out as a preference to begin decision-making on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=422)|
| 0:07:09| this discussion, working from a hybrid plan that sets the commitment of the city to the first X amount of dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=429)|
| 0:07:19| paid into that to any employee's salary. That is, an employee, in this case, up to $40,000 every, to that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=439)|
| 0:07:27| the city bears all the risk, makes a commitment for the outcome. As you get higher and higher, then the employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=447)|
| 0:07:32| subsumes more and more of the market risk. And I think there are reasons for that that are fairly evident in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=452)|
| 0:07:38| equity and the ability to afford to bear that market risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=458)|
| 0:07:43| I'm not going to get any more into detail. Just saying that is the way we thought framing this discussion would be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=463)|
| 0:07:49| Council is free to frame it other ways or pursue in other areas and avenues of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=469)|
| 0:07:54| We think those include in our thinking about it and in the administration and not only the financial elements of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=474)|
| 0:08:02| that's one thing, and that's the way most of this is framed, but also recognizing there are concerns with respect to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=482)|
| 0:08:07| retention and recruitment of employees that enter the discussion, its impact on future employees, and the city's ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=487)|
| 0:08:14| to get good employees and keep them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=494)|
| 0:08:19| And then the last consideration, obviously, is our equity considerations and fairness considerations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=499)|
| 0:08:25| So all three of those entered our deliberations, but the dominant thing right now, obviously, is what will drive most of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=505)|
| 0:08:31| this at the beginning are the overriding financial considerations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=511)|
| 0:08:37| So Alan Pennington, who we've worked with, and let me just say a word about Alan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=517)|
| 0:08:42| Alan has been very responsive. Megan Turow is with here, his assistant, in answering questions and helping us structure these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=522)|
| 0:08:50| And our understanding at the administration was he would continue to be able to, what we said, was tweak these somewhat in response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=530)|
| 0:08:56| to what council might want to see in terms of some adjustments or others might want to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=536)|
| 0:09:01| Our understanding was when retaining Alan was he would prepare all these and they would be available for some degree of what we've called| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=541)|
| 0:09:07| tweaking. We haven't really said exactly how far that would go, but obviously we thought there were some limits upon what would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=547)|
| 0:09:13| reasonable and allow us to function effectively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=553)|
| 0:09:19| So I'm going to turn it over to Alan, who's going to make a presentation, and basically will elaborate on a lot of the tables and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=559)|
| 0:09:24| material that he presented to you, and then I'll turn it over to Vice Mayor as to how to structure discussion and all that afterwards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=564)|
| 0:09:29| and we'll sort of step back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=569)|
| 0:09:35| I really feel strongly in other way that we hear the presentation, you know, formulate your questions as he speaks and what have you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=575)|
| 0:09:43| and then, you know, start our discussion, questions, whatever, after his presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=583)|
| 0:09:49| Is everybody agreeable with that? Does this seem to work? Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=589)|
| 0:09:54| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=594)|
| 0:09:59| As long as it's we might need clarification on what something meant because it's in technical terms and we want to explain what you mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=599)|
| 0:10:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=605)|
| 0:10:10| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=610)|
| 0:10:15| Again, my name is Alan Pennington. I'm the pension actuary for the Knoxville Pension System, have been the consulting actuary since 2001,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=615)|
| 0:10:20| and have been working with the Knoxville Pension System on and off since 1990.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=620)|
| 0:10:25| So it's been my pleasure to have that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=625)|
| 0:10:30| I've worked with the mayor and with Dr. Lyons and Mr. Maness to work on these issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=630)|
| 0:10:36| and I wanted to thank them and thank you very much for the opportunity to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=636)|
| 0:10:42| Obviously, we won't get all your questions answered tonight, but I'll be working diligently with you through Dr. Lyons to hopefully get all of your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=642)|
| 0:10:50| answers, all your questions answered methodically and quickly as best as I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=650)|
| 0:10:56| So with that said, I hope everybody has two different handouts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=656)|
| 0:11:04| One you just got tonight that you have not seen before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=664)|
| 0:11:09| This is a PowerPoint presentation that I'm going to incorporate into my comments tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=669)|
| 0:11:14| So if I refer to the PowerPoint, this is the one I'm referring to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=674)|
| 0:11:19| The other one is the one that I hope you got in the mail about or in the email about a week ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=679)|
| 0:11:24| This is a PDF file that has several nine pages in it that covers various different aspects of the plan design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=684)|
| 0:11:32| So, yes, ma'am?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=692)|
| 0:11:37| You don't have this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=697)|
| 0:11:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=702)|
| 0:11:47| Megan, can you help me out here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=707)|
| 0:11:52| While Megan is helping hand those out, I am going to start with the PDF file that I believe you've had an opportunity to see already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=712)|
| 0:12:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=742)|
| 0:12:27| Thanks, Megan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=747)|
| 0:12:32| If you'll look in the PDF file, which is the one that you've had already on page one, you'll see a 30-year cost projection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=752)|
| 0:12:40| This first page does not reflect any of the plan design considerations that we'll be looking at tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=760)|
| 0:12:46| This is a projection of what might happen over the next 30 years under the current plan provisions under either A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=766)|
| 0:12:57| the scenario where we get seven and three-eighths percent return per year for the next 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=777)|
| 0:13:02| Seven and three-eighths is the current valuation assumption that was recently adopted by the pension board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=782)|
| 0:13:08| previously down from eight percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=788)|
| 0:13:13| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=793)|
| 0:13:18| So seven and three-eighths is the most recent change that we've made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=798)|
| 0:13:23| That line is the lower of the two lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=803)|
| 0:13:28| If over the next 30 years, let's say a more conservative asset policy was adopted, and instead of getting seven and three-eighths,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=808)|
| 0:13:37| because benefits are essentially being paid for by a combination of the investment return, city contributions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=817)|
| 0:13:42| and the employee contributions, which are, of course, fixed at six percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=822)|
| 0:13:47| and they will also be fixed in all the scenarios that we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=827)|
| 0:13:52| So this at least gives you a little bit of bracket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=832)|
| 0:13:57| It's not to say the contribution couldn't be less than that if the returns are higher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=837)|
| 0:14:02| but it gives you some reasonable expectation of what might happen over the next, you know, 20, 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=842)|
| 0:14:10| Before we start looking at any other scenarios, is there any, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=850)|
| 0:14:15| do you want everybody to just hold questions until the end?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=855)|
| 0:14:20| Okay, so if anybody has questions, we can go back and refer to this if you need any clarification on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=860)|
| 0:14:26| Do you have a plot of the eight percent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=866)|
| 0:14:30| I do not have a plot of the eight percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=870)|
| 0:14:32| If that is something that's desired, I can certainly put that together in response to, I'm sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=872)|
| 0:14:37| many other questions which will be coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=877)|
| 0:14:39| Assume it's below the two lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=879)|
| 0:14:41| That would be correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=881)|
| 0:14:47| Based on the experience study, based on input from summit strategies, based on historical returns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=887)|
| 0:14:54| seven and three-eighths is what the current expectation is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=894)|
| 0:14:59| That's not to say it couldn't be eight percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=899)|
| 0:15:01| but that's no longer believed based on input from our investment advisor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=901)|
| 0:15:06| and other information that I've put together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=906)|
| 0:15:09| Eight percent is no longer consistent with what our long-term expectations are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=909)|
| 0:15:16| If you look at the PowerPoint presentation that I handed out, you should have gotten this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=916)|
| 0:15:29| Here we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=929)|
| 0:15:31| This focuses on an explanation of the various plan design options that are currently under consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=931)|
| 0:15:40| That is not to say that the provisions that you're going to see explained here are what we are now recommending,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=940)|
| 0:15:47| that one of those should be chosen for the ballot in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=947)|
| 0:15:50| All we're saying is that this is a structure to start discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=950)|
| 0:15:54| So I'm sure there are going to be questions to come back to say, can we tweak this assumption?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=954)|
| 0:15:58| Can we change that assumption?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=958)|
| 0:16:00| If we change this, what does it do to the cost projections?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=960)|
| 0:16:03| Those are things that are going to be going on, I'm sure, over the next several weeks and perhaps a couple months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=963)|
| 0:16:08| So, you know, if you see any one particular plan provision that you're not satisfied with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=968)|
| 0:16:13| I'm sure I'll be getting feedback from you as well as feedback from the employee representatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=973)|
| 0:16:17| So I would ask that you just look at this as a framework within which we can begin our discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=977)|
| 0:16:25| On page two of this presentation, you see the plan design alternatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=985)|
| 0:16:30| We have the current defined benefit plan at the top, so, you know, if we just stick with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=990)|
| 0:16:35| that's going to be one of the different projections we're going to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=995)|
| 0:16:39| There's five other ones ranging, as Dr. Lyons indicated, from a full defined benefit plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=999)|
| 0:16:46| the modified current DB plan, where all of the market risk would continue to stay with the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1006)|
| 0:16:53| and the city would be responsible to make up any investment returns below which our current assumption is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1013)|
| 0:17:01| We have three hybrid alternatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1021)|
| 0:17:03| All three of the hybrids share the market risk between the city and between the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1023)|
| 0:17:10| And what I mean by that is if there are higher returns than expected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1030)|
| 0:17:15| that means the city contribution is going to be relatively less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1035)|
| 0:17:19| It also means that the benefit for the employees could be relatively larger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1039)|
| 0:17:25| On the other hand, if the returns that we see under these hybrid plans are less than expected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1045)|
| 0:17:32| that means the city's contribution is going to be higher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1052)|
| 0:17:36| and then the benefits to the employees would be relatively lower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1056)|
| 0:17:39| So there's some shared risk in those three hybrid scenarios.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1059)|
| 0:17:43| In the D.C. only scenario, all of the market risk in that scenario would be on the employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1063)|
| 0:17:50| Any high returns benefits the employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1070)|
| 0:17:53| Any low returns is to the detriment of the employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1073)|
| 0:17:56| So we're looking sort of at a full range of options here for the council's consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1076)|
| 0:18:04| Under the modified current D.B. plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1084)|
| 0:18:08| we've taken all the provisions of the current plan G1 and G2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1088)|
| 0:18:14| and then we've looked at the current Division C for fire and police,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1094)|
| 0:18:19| and we've said let's increase the normal retirement age to 65 as our starting point in general government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1099)|
| 0:18:25| and 57 in the fire and police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1105)|
| 0:18:28| Reduce the COLA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1108)|
| 0:18:30| The cost of living adjustment currently is set at a minimum of 3% and can go up to 4%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1110)|
| 0:18:36| Under this scenario, it would be a 0 to 3% based on the CPI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1116)|
| 0:18:41| So it might be between 2 and 3 a lot, but it would be capped at a 3% maximum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1121)|
| 0:18:48| The current drop plan, deferred retirement option plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1128)|
| 0:18:52| would not be available in any of these scenarios as we have them currently provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1132)|
| 0:19:00| The current final average pay is a two-year final average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1140)|
| 0:19:03| Under the proposed design options, it would be a five-year final average pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1143)|
| 0:19:10| And that's true not only under the modified current,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1150)|
| 0:19:15| but in each one of these other alternatives, if it says hybrid at the top of the page,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1155)|
| 0:19:20| the DB plan also reflects these same retirement age, reduce COLA, drop, no drop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1160)|
| 0:19:28| and the five-year final average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1168)|
| 0:19:29| So even though I'm not repeating these provisions on every page,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1169)|
| 0:19:32| these provisions also apply to the hybrid plans as well as to this modified current DB plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1172)|
| 0:19:40| Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1180)|
| 0:19:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1181)|
| 0:19:42| I really do think that we have to have a clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1182)|
| 0:19:44| We're never going to get back through all this stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1184)|
| 0:19:46| I just want to ask you if average pay is base pay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1186)|
| 0:19:49| Is it overtime pay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1189)|
| 0:19:50| What are you talking about when you say average pay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1190)|
| 0:19:52| I have not assumed any change to the definition of pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1192)|
| 0:19:56| So the current definition would continue to be applicable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1196)|
| 0:20:00| It would just be a five-year average instead of a two-year average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1200)|
| 0:20:03| Current definition, base pay or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1203)|
| 0:20:07| To be honest, I don't know if it's just base pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1207)|
| 0:20:09| I'd have to go back and look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1209)|
| 0:20:14| It's all pay, not just base pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1214)|
| 0:20:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1218)|
| 0:20:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1219)|
| 0:20:25| Again, just to reemphasize, all these plan design options that we're looking at here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1225)|
| 0:20:30| we are not proposing them for current employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1230)|
| 0:20:34| Any of the design options that are under consideration would be for new employees that enter after a given date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1234)|
| 0:20:40| whether that's July 1, 2013 or whatever that date ends up being.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1240)|
| 0:20:44| But we are not talking at this point about any changes for current employees, just to reemphasize that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1244)|
| 0:20:52| Mr. Vice Chairman, you might note that Mr. Cherry, the executive director of the pension board, is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1252)|
| 0:20:58| So some of these questions may need to go to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1258)|
| 0:21:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1261)|
| 0:21:02| Do we want to change the format?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1262)|
| 0:21:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1265)|
| 0:21:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1271)|
| 0:21:12| I just got a revised comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1272)|
| 0:21:13| Base plus longevity pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1273)|
| 0:21:16| No overtime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1276)|
| 0:21:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1280)|
| 0:21:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1286)|
| 0:21:28| In the general government, the first hybrid option, the DBDC basic, this is made up of two components,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1288)|
| 0:21:35| a defined benefit plan which would provide 1.35 percent five-year final average pay time service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1295)|
| 0:21:42| as a monthly benefit payable beginning at age 65.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1302)|
| 0:21:46| In addition to that defined benefit component, there would also be a defined contribution account,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1306)|
| 0:21:53| much like the current G1 account, if you're familiar with G1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1313)|
| 0:21:56| where there's a 3 percent employee contribution, a 1.5 percent city contribution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1316)|
| 0:22:03| and then whatever that account accumulates to would also be payable to the member at retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1323)|
| 0:22:12| That amount also in the DC account is available as an annuity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1332)|
| 0:22:16| Our experience has been most people take that as a lump sum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1336)|
| 0:22:19| We haven't seen many people actually take the annuity option, but it is available as an annuity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1339)|
| 0:22:28| Under the second hybrid option, the DBDC plus, there's a defined benefit component| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1348)|
| 0:22:35| that pays 2 percent of final average pay, five-year final average pay time service at age 65.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1355)|
| 0:22:42| In addition, well, that base defined benefit amount only uses pay capped at $40,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1362)|
| 0:22:52| So if somebody is making less than $40,000 a year when they retire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1372)|
| 0:22:56| then they get all of their pay included in this defined benefit calculation, in this formula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1376)|
| 0:23:03| If they're making $50,000, $60,000, only up to $40,000 is used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1383)|
| 0:23:09| But if they're making more than $40,000, they also get a defined contribution account,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1389)|
| 0:23:17| where they have a 6 percent employee contribution applied to pay in excess of $40,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1397)|
| 0:23:24| So if they're making $50,000 a year, then they get a 6 percent of $10,000 would go in for their city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1404)|
| 0:23:32| and for their employee contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1412)|
| 0:23:34| And then the employer contribution would be 8 percent, again, of that excess pay, pay over $40,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1414)|
| 0:23:41| In this way, a higher paid individual still has the base DB amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1421)|
| 0:23:47| but they also have a variable DC account based on their compensation in excess of $40,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1427)|
| 0:23:55| So the people that are making lower compensation are not taking any risk or taking relatively less risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1435)|
| 0:24:03| People that are making higher compensation would be taking relatively more risk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1443)|
| 0:24:08| in terms of the future investment returns because the DC component would, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1448)|
| 0:24:12| it would just pay whatever that account balance is at retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1452)|
| 0:24:23| The third hybrid option, sharing the risk between the employee and the employer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1463)|
| 0:24:31| is what we're calling the DB-DC max.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1471)|
| 0:24:36| The DB component is the same as the second hybrid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1476)|
| 0:24:45| 2 percent of pay, five-year final average earnings, time service at age 65.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1485)|
| 0:24:52| However, in this plan design option, if the DC account balance, which is based on total pay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1492)|
| 0:25:00| so now you've got 6 percent contributions of your total pay, base plus longevity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1500)|
| 0:25:06| plus an 8 percent city contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1506)|
| 0:25:08| If that account balance produces a bigger annuity than the 2 percent of pay formula,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1508)|
| 0:25:15| then you get the benefit based on your DC account balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1515)|
| 0:25:19| So if your account balance does well or does very well, even if you're making $40,000 a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1519)|
| 0:25:26| you might still get a bigger benefit than that 2 percent of pay base benefit formula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1526)|
| 0:25:33| So if you work 30 years and you're making $40,000 a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1533)|
| 0:25:38| you'd be looking at 60 percent of final average pay at retirement or $24,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1538)|
| 0:25:43| If your DC account balance produces a bigger benefit than $24,000 a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1543)|
| 0:25:52| you get that bigger benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1552)|
| 0:25:54| Now, if you're making $50,000 a year, your defined benefit portion is still $24,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1554)|
| 0:26:01| because it's still based on a cap of $40,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1561)|
| 0:26:04| but your defined contribution account is not capped at $40,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1564)|
| 0:26:08| So in that scenario, you might expect a benefit of $28,000 a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1568)|
| 0:26:13| if you met all of your investment return assumptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1573)|
| 0:26:17| So in that case, again, we're putting less investment risk on the lower paid folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1577)|
| 0:26:23| more investment risk on the higher paid folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1583)|
| 0:26:25| So the higher paid folks have the ability to get a similar percentage of pay at retirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1585)|
| 0:26:31| but it's not guaranteed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1591)|
| 0:26:33| But everybody still has that base benefit of 2 percent of final average pay limited to $40,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1593)|
| 0:26:46| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1606)|
| 0:26:51| The fifth option now goes all the way over to all investment risk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1611)|
| 0:26:56| sits on the employee with a full defined contribution plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1616)|
| 0:27:03| For the general government, it's 6 percent employee contributions, 8 percent city contributions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1623)|
| 0:27:10| Whatever the account balance is is what it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1630)|
| 0:27:13| and the city is not taking any investment risk under this option, again, for new employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1633)|
| 0:27:23| Now, these five options that I've just talked through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1643)|
| 0:27:26| we have the same five options under the fire and police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1646)|
| 0:27:31| The provisions are a bit different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1651)|
| 0:27:32| The retirement age is 57 instead of 65.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1652)|
| 0:27:36| The multiplier is a little different than one of the options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1656)|
| 0:27:41| But they work essentially the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1661)|
| 0:27:48| At this time, do you want me to walk through, Mr. Pavlis, the fire and police options?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1668)|
| 0:27:54| Go ahead and walk through those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1674)|
| 0:27:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1675)|
| 0:27:56| Mr. Chairman, I beg permission to ask a minor question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1676)|
| 0:28:00| Compound the confusion if we go through the same thing not knowing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1680)|
| 0:28:05| In your mixed DBDC options, does the city pay the entire defined benefit with no contribution from the employee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1685)|
| 0:28:14| And it's only in the variable account that the employee kicks in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1694)|
| 0:28:17| In the case of the DBDC, well, it's different for each one, I guess, is the short answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1697)|
| 0:28:22| So shall I walk through each one and explain it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1702)|
| 0:28:24| You said 2 percent pretty much across the board was the, well, 1.35 and then 2 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1704)|
| 0:28:29| Who's 2 percent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1709)|
| 0:28:31| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1711)|
| 0:28:32| The employees pay 6 percent regardless in all the scenarios, and the city would pay any additional cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1712)|
| 0:28:38| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1718)|
| 0:28:39| That's my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1719)|
| 0:28:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1720)|
| 0:28:45| May I proceed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1725)|
| 0:28:46| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1726)|
| 0:28:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1727)|
| 0:28:48| Under the fire and police, the first option under the fire and police is the modified current.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1728)|
| 0:28:57| It has the age 57 normal retirement age under this initial proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1737)|
| 0:29:04| The reduced COLA is zero to three, removing the drop in five-year final average pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1744)|
| 0:29:09| So very similar in the general government and the fire and police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1749)|
| 0:29:16| In the first hybrid plan under fire and police, the DBDC basic, you have a separate DB component,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1756)|
| 0:29:23| 1.15 percent of pay times five-year final average time service at 57,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1763)|
| 0:29:28| and the DC account mirrors the account in the general government for the DBDC basic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1768)|
| 0:29:36| 3 percent of the employee contributions, 1.5 percent of city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1776)|
| 0:29:40| In this scenario, you've got 3 percent going into the DB plan and 3 percent into the DC plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1780)|
| 0:29:45| so the employees are paying 6 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1785)|
| 0:29:48| Very similar to the general government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1788)|
| 0:29:52| On the fire and police, DBDC plus, again, very, very similar to the general government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1792)|
| 0:29:57| except we have an age 57 retirement age,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1797)|
| 0:30:01| and actually the DBDC account in the fire and police should be 6 percent and 10 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1801)|
| 0:30:10| That's a typo on that page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1810)|
| 0:30:12| It should be 6 percent and 10 percent under the DBDC plus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1812)|
| 0:30:15| but otherwise works the same way as the general government DBDC plus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1815)|
| 0:30:25| The DBDC max, likewise, works the same way as the general government, age 57 normal retirement age,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1825)|
| 0:30:33| 6 percent employee contributions, 10 percent city in the DC account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1833)|
| 0:30:44| And the DC only, same except 6 percent employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1844)|
| 0:30:49| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1849)|
| 0:30:50| 6 percent employee, 10 percent city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1850)|
| 0:30:55| So I won't go through as much detail on the fire and police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1855)|
| 0:30:59| as they operate pretty much the same way as the general government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1859)|
| 0:31:04| Now, with this presentation, that really gets us through page two of the PDF handout that you already had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1864)|
| 0:31:16| You may have several other questions from that PDF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1876)|
| 0:31:19| We've already covered a lot of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1879)|
| 0:31:21| I think it's very important to understand what we've covered at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1881)|
| 0:31:25| So, Mr. Chairperson, if it would be okay to allow persons to ask questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1885)|
| 0:31:31| if we can try to limit it to this material for right now, that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1891)|
| 0:31:35| Councilman DelVopia, recognize before your light goes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1895)|
| 0:31:39| You anticipated it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1899)|
| 0:31:41| Well, I guess I'm questioning about the starting point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1901)|
| 0:31:45| Every one of the scenarios you just outlined deals with employees hired somewhere after November 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1905)|
| 0:31:53| You even mentioned July 2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1913)|
| 0:31:57| That sounds like about 100 to 150 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1917)|
| 0:32:01| We've got 1,600 employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1921)|
| 0:32:03| We've got 2,300 retirees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1923)|
| 0:32:06| You're proposing nothing as affects those existing employees in all these scenarios you've gone through?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1926)|
| 0:32:13| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1933)|
| 0:32:15| And you're tackling a $20-plus million problem by addressing pensions related to 100 people that will be starting out at age 25 or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1935)|
| 0:32:26| Let me break in here, if I could, Councilman DelVopia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1946)|
| 0:32:30| Our understanding, and basically our discussion with Mr. Pennington from the beginning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1950)|
| 0:32:34| was to respect the Blackwell Supreme Court decision that was made in the 80s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1954)|
| 0:32:39| in which the Tennessee Supreme Court, according to most interpretations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1959)|
| 0:32:43| and there's an attorney general opinion rendered on this also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1963)|
| 0:32:46| was that the obligations for people once they were vested could not be altered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1966)|
| 0:32:55| And there was some question about whether even it was prior to vesting that that was a –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1975)|
| 0:33:02| I'm not the person to get into any legal background on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1982)|
| 0:33:05| but basically that was seen as an obligation and that, in this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1985)|
| 0:33:10| it was Shelby County could not change any pensions for any employees who were vested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1990)|
| 0:33:15| That's a Tennessee Supreme Court decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1995)|
| 0:33:17| and that's why that has guided our pursuit of the remedies and looking to just change this for new employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=1997)|
| 0:33:26| And your opinion includes the fact that you can't alter COLA, you can't alter retirement age,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2006)|
| 0:33:32| you can't alter employee contributions or anything for an existing employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2012)|
| 0:33:36| even though it might make the system actuarially sound and help it survive and pay the employee benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2016)|
| 0:33:43| I'm just referring to the Blackwell decision saying that all of those things you named were things that could not be altered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2023)|
| 0:33:49| I guess they could be potentially with the acquiescence of every single employee who had signed on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2029)|
| 0:33:55| but it's a very far-reaching decision that does say just what you just articulated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2035)|
| 0:33:59| So the option is to go bankrupt or to raise taxes or to cut services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2039)|
| 0:34:03| Is that the position you're taking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2043)|
| 0:34:06| I'm just repeating what the Blackwell decision had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2046)|
| 0:34:09| I'm not taking a position, but I tend to take Supreme Court decisions pretty seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2049)|
| 0:34:15| They depend on their facts, but that's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2055)|
| 0:34:21| Any more questions, Melissa?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2061)|
| 0:34:23| I guess I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2063)|
| 0:34:24| Hold on one second, Melissa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2064)|
| 0:34:26| Yeah, I had a question on the different scenarios that you proposed here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2066)|
| 0:34:29| What is the vesting on these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2069)|
| 0:34:32| Right now we have five-year vesting in the G1, G2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2072)|
| 0:34:36| For the initial discussions, we have assumed vesting remains at five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2076)|
| 0:34:39| I've heard a couple suggestions that it might be considered to use ten years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2079)|
| 0:34:44| but that has not been reflected in any of these scenarios to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2084)|
| 0:34:49| And there would be a variance between the two scenarios if there was five-year vesting or ten-year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2089)|
| 0:34:55| The cost implications between five-year and ten-year are not particularly significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2095)|
| 0:35:01| The significance would be if you wanted to come back later| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2101)|
| 0:35:04| and decided you wanted to change some benefit structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2104)|
| 0:35:07| you can change it for non-vested employees, again referring back to the Blackwell decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2107)|
| 0:35:11| so you end up having a longer period within which if you decide you really didn't mean to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2111)|
| 0:35:17| or you wanted to change something, you actually could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2117)|
| 0:35:20| And do you know, or does anyone here know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2120)|
| 0:35:23| how many of the current existing employees on the payroll are not vested right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2123)|
| 0:35:30| Mike Cherry might know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2130)|
| 0:35:37| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2137)|
| 0:35:42| Of the total number of folks that are currently active as of July 1, 2011,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2142)|
| 0:35:50| which was just under 1,500 people, 365 were non-vested at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2150)|
| 0:35:57| Now, some of the people probably have become vested since July 1 of last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2157)|
| 0:36:01| but at that time, 365 members in the system had not yet become vested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2161)|
| 0:36:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2166)|
| 0:36:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2167)|
| 0:36:08| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2168)|
| 0:36:10| Councilman Stater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2170)|
| 0:36:12| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2172)|
| 0:36:14| Mr. Pinkham, not to look at Page 1 or this employee contribution projection, you know, I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2174)|
| 0:36:21| Just to me, this just seems like enormous, just a complete disaster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2181)|
| 0:36:26| Is there a short version on how this happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2186)|
| 0:36:30| 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2190)|
| 0:36:32| So prior to that year, if you were looking at the projected contribution was around zero?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2192)|
| 0:36:43| It wasn't zero, but it was much less than what you're seeing in that scenario, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2203)|
| 0:36:50| Because originally it would be designed to oscillate around zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2210)|
| 0:36:53| No, no, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2213)|
| 0:36:54| It would originally be designed to oscillate about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2214)|
| 0:36:57| the ongoing cost of benefits accruing each year might be on average, let's say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2217)|
| 0:37:04| 11 percent of pay between the fire and police and the general government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2224)|
| 0:37:09| So if we met all of our assumptions, we met our seven and three-eighths or 8 percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2229)|
| 0:37:13| or whatever that assumption was, and retirements, turnovers, deaths, all that stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2233)|
| 0:37:18| we would expect long term, even if there's no changes, to put in, let's say, 11, 12 percent of pay every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2238)|
| 0:37:27| And to the extent you have gains and losses, it would oscillate around that 12 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2247)|
| 0:37:33| And in terms of percent, I mean, we're looking out five or ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2253)|
| 0:37:37| When you're getting into the city having to contribute 25 to 35 million out of a budget of 170 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2257)|
| 0:37:46| what is that percentage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2266)|
| 0:37:49| I mean, currently we're the projection is, what, 13 million dollars for the upcoming fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2269)|
| 0:37:56| The payroll is 65 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2276)|
| 0:37:59| So we're already approaching 20 percent in the next fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2279)|
| 0:38:05| Within ten years, you know, that could be 40 percent of pay, 35, 40 percent of pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2285)|
| 0:38:13| That's probably what those numbers you're looking at represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2293)|
| 0:38:16| I don't have the percentage of pay, but I can certainly get those for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2296)|
| 0:38:24| And this, I mean, and the thing about the market, I mean, the market was down, but it seems like it's rebounded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2304)|
| 0:38:30| but it hasn't rebounded enough to affect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2310)|
| 0:38:34| It's rebounded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2314)|
| 0:38:35| We had very, very good returns in the year ending June 30th, 11, and June 30th, 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2315)|
| 0:38:43| But those rebounds were not near significant enough to wipe out all the losses that we got in 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2323)|
| 0:38:49| So we're still relatively behind the eight ball, as it were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2329)|
| 0:38:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2334)|
| 0:38:55| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2335)|
| 0:38:56| Thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2336)|
| 0:38:58| Just a brief question about the defined contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2338)|
| 0:39:04| What portion, whether it's a portion or just that option alone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2344)|
| 0:39:09| have investment options for the employee been discussed, an array of risk and so forth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2349)|
| 0:39:17| Whatever that is, whatever we settle on, if there is a defined contribution portion, we've got to flesh that out a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2357)|
| 0:39:26| Actually, if there's a defined contribution, you're talking about the hybrid options now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2366)|
| 0:39:29| Well, a hybrid option or just the straight defined contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2369)|
| 0:39:33| My thought at this time, and everything is subject to discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2373)|
| 0:39:37| but my thought is in the hybrid plan, just like in the current, are you familiar with how the G1 plan works?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2377)|
| 0:39:45| Just like in the G1, the city still invests all that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2385)|
| 0:39:49| So the employees are not making investment decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2389)|
| 0:39:51| There's still one pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2391)|
| 0:39:53| It's allocated to individuals, but they're not making the investment decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2393)|
| 0:39:58| My thought at this time would be if any one of the three hybrid options was used,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2398)|
| 0:40:04| then there would be a similar type structure where there's still one pool of money invested by the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2404)|
| 0:40:09| whether it's summit strategies or whoever the investment managers would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2409)|
| 0:40:13| and then it would be allocated up to the employees as appropriate for whichever the design option was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2413)|
| 0:40:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2419)|
| 0:40:20| Let me try to address some of Councilman Stier's question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2420)|
| 0:40:24| And, Alan, you may pitch in and tell me how far off base I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2424)|
| 0:40:28| As I recall, and I have only looked at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2428)|
| 0:40:33| 2008, I think our assets were around $550 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2433)|
| 0:40:41| At year-end last, when your report was rendered to us, as of June 30th, it was $468 million, if I recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2441)|
| 0:40:52| Today, or at the end of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2452)|
| 0:40:54| That's the market value, not the actuarial value, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2454)|
| 0:40:57| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2457)|
| 0:40:58| The market value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2458)|
| 0:40:59| I'm talking market value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2459)|
| 0:41:00| And there's the $468 at year-end last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2460)|
| 0:41:04| As of the end of March, last month, that asset, total asset value, market value, was $462, as I recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2464)|
| 0:41:16| Now, keep in mind, the city is making a contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2476)|
| 0:41:20| The employees are making contributions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2480)|
| 0:41:23| But, of course, we are paying out $40 million plus a year in retirement benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2483)|
| 0:41:30| And when you add all that up, the corpus has not grown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2490)|
| 0:41:34| So the actuarial value, depending on your assumption, if it's 8%, the actuarial value is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2494)|
| 0:41:42| you'd have to add another $127 million, if I recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2502)|
| 0:41:46| Was that the number you used last year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2506)|
| 0:41:49| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2509)|
| 0:41:50| Restate the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2510)|
| 0:41:51| The actuarial difference would be about $127 million at 8% assumption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2511)|
| 0:41:57| The difference between the smooth actuarial asset value and the market value is not a function of the interest rate assumption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2517)|
| 0:42:07| That is to say, once you get a gain or loss, it is whatever it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2527)|
| 0:42:11| And that gain or loss is smoothed over ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2531)|
| 0:42:15| And that's what goes into the calculation of the smooth asset value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2535)|
| 0:42:18| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2538)|
| 0:42:19| We're talking about a real value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2539)|
| 0:42:22| In other words, what corpus do we need to have to make sure that it is sound| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2542)|
| 0:42:27| and we are able to fund the benefits that we have promised our employees at whatever time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2547)|
| 0:42:34| And so that is going to be far greater than the market value right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2554)|
| 0:42:41| Well, that number depends, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2561)|
| 0:42:43| That difference is going to depend on your assumption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2563)|
| 0:42:46| If you lower the assumption to 6.5%, as we see, then our liability rises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2566)|
| 0:42:53| But I would submit that that's a fairly real assumption at 6.5% or perhaps even lower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2573)|
| 0:43:02| If you think about market returns now, yes, the market has done pretty well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2582)|
| 0:43:05| but look at our performance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2585)|
| 0:43:07| We have not mirrored the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2587)|
| 0:43:12| Maybe I read into this question that we hope the market will blunt some of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2592)|
| 0:43:15| and certainly we do, but so far it really hasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2595)|
| 0:43:21| Councilman Walz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2601)|
| 0:43:22| Okay, you got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2602)|
| 0:43:23| So what is the ten-year average rate of return?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2603)|
| 0:43:29| Now, Alan, last year when you gave us the report, it was 6.01, ten-year average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2609)|
| 0:43:35| That's what I was going to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2615)|
| 0:43:36| I've got that here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2616)|
| 0:43:42| The average rate of return since June 30th, 2002, this is page 37 of the valuation report, is 5.3%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2622)|
| 0:43:52| Is that before fees or afterwards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2632)|
| 0:43:54| That's after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2634)|
| 0:43:55| That's after fees, 5.3%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2635)|
| 0:43:57| And let me say that these are estimates that I put together each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2637)|
| 0:44:01| This is not the, you know, the actual returns coming from the investment manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2641)|
| 0:44:06| These are ones that I, you know, assume mid-year cash flows and, you know, net of expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2646)|
| 0:44:12| So, you know, this is not exact to the tenth of a percent, but approximately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2652)|
| 0:44:17| What page was that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2657)|
| 0:44:18| This is on page 37 of the July 1, 2011, valuation report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2658)|
| 0:44:25| So the rate of return is 5.3%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2665)|
| 0:44:27| So why don't we have a graph here that shows 5.3% of what you have a ten-year average of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2667)|
| 0:44:33| I mean, do you think those ten years are abnormal or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2673)|
| 0:44:36| Yes, the last ten years have been exceptionally abnormal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2676)|
| 0:44:40| How can you say ten years have been abnormal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2680)|
| 0:44:42| I mean, that's, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2682)|
| 0:44:43| So what was it over 20 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2683)|
| 0:44:44| Was it a lot different than that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2684)|
| 0:44:46| I mean, I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2686)|
| 0:44:47| It's about 7.85 to 8%, something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2687)|
| 0:44:51| If you figure 20 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2691)|
| 0:44:52| 20 years, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2692)|
| 0:44:53| It goes up to 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2693)|
| 0:44:54| 7.3, 7 and I think it was 7.85 or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2694)|
| 0:45:03| So were there discussions after 2008 that said, City of Knoxville, we have a problem here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2703)|
| 0:45:08| We just lost and we have a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2708)|
| 0:45:11| Did you all make some suggestions and corrections of how this should be corrected back then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2711)|
| 0:45:18| and they were either ignored or just hadn't been put in place yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2718)|
| 0:45:22| I think Knoxville is in the same situation that a lot of cities and states are all over the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2722)|
| 0:45:28| And I think everybody is, you know, based on their particular situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2728)|
| 0:45:33| analyzing and trying to put a plan in place in a methodical way that's going to, you know, not just try to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2733)|
| 0:45:39| I mean, there's no way to Band-Aid patch or get us back to where we were in 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2739)|
| 0:45:43| I mean, there's just no way to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2743)|
| 0:45:44| There's no quick fix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2744)|
| 0:45:46| So, you know, I worked with the former administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2746)|
| 0:45:50| I'm working with this administration to try to come up with some suggestions on things to address the issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2750)|
| 0:45:57| and to try to put us in a situation where 2008 is not repeated again, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2757)|
| 0:46:04| We can't undo it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2764)|
| 0:46:07| And, you know, nothing we do is going to take those projections that you were looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2767)|
| 0:46:12| and materially decrease the 10-year, 15-year forecast,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2772)|
| 0:46:16| because most of those numbers apply to current employees, not future employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2776)|
| 0:46:21| But the Blackwell decision, you know, to some extent just ties our hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2781)|
| 0:46:26| So, would you say, so 2011, you said 2011 is a big year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2786)|
| 0:46:30| What was our rate of return in 2011?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2790)|
| 0:46:34| 24.6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2794)|
| 0:46:37| And that was way outpacing the market, was it not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2797)|
| 0:46:42| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2802)|
| 0:46:45| The standard and poor one-year average was 30.69.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2805)|
| 0:46:51| And you were at 24.6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2811)|
| 0:46:53| So you were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2813)|
| 0:46:54| That's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2814)|
| 0:46:55| We're not 100% in equity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2815)|
| 0:46:57| So, you know, bond index was 3.56 for that year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2817)|
| 0:47:03| So, I mean, depending on which asset class you're looking at, regardless of how you slice it, the plan did very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2823)|
| 0:47:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2831)|
| 0:47:12| Remember, George, we started from a much lower, we were at a much lower base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2832)|
| 0:47:16| If I could, Mr. Chairman, I mean, I know we've got a lot of things here to talk about the plan design options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2836)|
| 0:47:22| All these issues are really, really good issues to flush out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2842)|
| 0:47:25| And I want to answer everybody's questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2845)|
| 0:47:27| But in light of trying to make sure that we get to this material, do we want to try to circle back around?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2847)|
| 0:47:33| Let's go ahead with one more question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2853)|
| 0:47:35| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2855)|
| 0:47:37| I was talking about what he actually went over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2857)|
| 0:47:39| And the reference that we were looking at, someone just said 500, excuse me, 468 million was the rough asset base as of July 1, 2011,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2859)|
| 0:47:53| according to your valuation report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2873)|
| 0:47:56| What is the liability in the same economic terms?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2876)|
| 0:47:59| Is that the 595 million or is it the 679 million on page one of your valuation year-end report?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2879)|
| 0:48:08| $595 million represents the value of benefits that have been accrued, that is, for service and compensation as of the valuation date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2888)|
| 0:48:19| So is that roughly comparable to the market value of the assets you have as of the valuation date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2899)|
| 0:48:25| In other words, are they the two numbers you compare?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2905)|
| 0:48:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2907)|
| 0:48:28| Those two numbers are the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2908)|
| 0:48:29| They were fully funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2909)|
| 0:48:30| And then we expect that 11, 12% of costs going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2910)|
| 0:48:33| But instead they're about 130 million shorter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2913)|
| 0:48:36| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2916)|
| 0:48:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2917)|
| 0:48:38| Now, going back to the – I still don't know that I understand the charts you went over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2918)|
| 0:48:41| In the defined benefit plan, employees, you said, give 6% or in the combo plans, the DBDC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2921)|
| 0:48:50| is that 6% falling down to the defined contribution or is that an additional 6%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2930)|
| 0:48:55| No, it's not an additional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2935)|
| 0:48:56| It's a total of 6%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2936)|
| 0:48:57| Six percent of the salary is what they pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2937)|
| 0:48:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2939)|
| 0:49:01| And then 6% drops down into their own defined contribution plan, which the city matches with either 8% or 10%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2941)|
| 0:49:09| depending on whether you're general government or police fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2949)|
| 0:49:13| Is that the way it works?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2953)|
| 0:49:15| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2955)|
| 0:49:16| I mean, depending on which hybrid you're looking at sort of depends on exactly how the exact dollars are broken up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2956)|
| 0:49:22| But at the end of the day, the employee contributes 6% and then the employer contributes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2962)|
| 0:49:27| the city contributes whatever is necessary to provide the benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2967)|
| 0:49:31| That's the benefit of the $40,000 or whatever cap you had there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2971)|
| 0:49:36| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2976)|
| 0:49:37| For the defined benefit plan, like let's just talk about a specific option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2977)|
| 0:49:41| So DC, DBDC plus, the employer is going to contribute to that defined benefit plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2981)|
| 0:49:48| 100%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2988)|
| 0:49:50| And then, well, actually, the city is going to, that's not correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2990)|
| 0:49:55| because the employees contribute 6% of pay up to $40,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2995)|
| 0:49:59| So if they're making $30,000 a year, all their employee contributions are going into the DB plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=2999)|
| 0:50:04| And are they not under the DBDC plus, are they not allowed to be in a defined contribution plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3004)|
| 0:50:10| Well, I mean, there could be an additional plan that's voluntary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3010)|
| 0:50:15| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3015)|
| 0:50:16| Yeah, that's not prohibiting that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3016)|
| 0:50:18| It's just that's not an additional cost, so it hasn't been put into the projection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3018)|
| 0:50:22| So that's aside from the savings plan, the 457 savings plan, which they can put money into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3022)|
| 0:50:26| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3026)|
| 0:50:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3027)|
| 0:50:28| And it's only for the people compensated over $40,000 that would have, in that option,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3028)|
| 0:50:32| a chance to put money in and have a city match.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3032)|
| 0:50:35| I mean, it would be mandatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3035)|
| 0:50:37| It's not optional for the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3037)|
| 0:50:38| Oh, it's mandatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3038)|
| 0:50:39| It's mandatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3039)|
| 0:50:40| That's how the benefits comprise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3040)|
| 0:50:41| The 6% is mandatory across the board under any of these options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3041)|
| 0:50:44| One last question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3044)|
| 0:50:45| You said there were 365 people, more or less, not vested of the 1,535 currently working employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3045)|
| 0:50:52| Why are you not applying these rules to the 365 as opposed to targeting just the 100 new hires that we might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3052)|
| 0:50:59| or might not have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3059)|
| 0:51:00| I don't understand why you're looking at the smallest base possible to apply the new rules to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3060)|
| 0:51:08| I could address that, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3068)|
| 0:51:10| We made a decision going into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3070)|
| 0:51:12| That was an option, obviously, to have something apply to people who are not yet vested in the first five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3072)|
| 0:51:19| And then you start thinking in terms, again, of fairness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3079)|
| 0:51:21| If somebody is one, do you do that to somebody who's one year short of being vested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3081)|
| 0:51:25| and create a two-tier system of a retirement with some people who came in to the system with an expectation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3085)|
| 0:51:32| of a certain retirement plan having a different plan than those who are one year ahead of them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3092)|
| 0:51:39| We thought at some point you would have to draw a line unless you went right to the very end of to where you would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3099)|
| 0:51:44| start applying the new plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3104)|
| 0:51:45| As we reduced that back to maybe it was in the first couple of years, maybe the first three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3105)|
| 0:51:50| it would produce a system where one employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3110)|
| 0:51:53| Okay, so fairness was your criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3113)|
| 0:51:55| And the next question you'll have to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3115)|
| 0:51:57| Can I address that one, too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3117)|
| 0:51:59| Can I address that one, too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3119)|
| 0:52:00| One other thing, not just fairness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3120)|
| 0:52:02| You might think 365 people out of 1,500 is a big percentage of liability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3122)|
| 0:52:07| but it's not because those non-vested people have the smallest benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3127)|
| 0:52:11| So changing their benefit structure has a relatively smaller impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3131)|
| 0:52:17| It's not 365 out of 1,500 in terms of percentage of liability, in other words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3137)|
| 0:52:22| They represent a much smaller percentage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3142)|
| 0:52:24| They tend to be younger and lower paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3144)|
| 0:52:26| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3146)|
| 0:52:27| And, of course, a lot of those are not going to stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3147)|
| 0:52:30| That's the other thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3150)|
| 0:52:31| I mean, not everybody stays the entire time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3151)|
| 0:52:33| You're right, Councilman DeLaValle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3153)|
| 0:52:34| It was a fairness issue and a practicality issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3154)|
| 0:52:37| And a lack of benefit that would be worth that cost is what led us to say let's focus on new hires| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3157)|
| 0:52:46| who then would know what they were getting into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3166)|
| 0:52:48| I'll defer to the next workshop, how you find the missing $20 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3168)|
| 0:52:51| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3171)|
| 0:52:56| Please go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3176)|
| 0:52:58| Hey, I'm looking at my $20 million house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3178)|
| 0:53:01| Alan, if you could kick that in, that would help a whole lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3181)|
| 0:53:03| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3183)|
| 0:53:04| No problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3184)|
| 0:53:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3185)|
| 0:53:07| That concludes this PowerPoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3187)|
| 0:53:10| So now we're going to turn over to the PDF presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3190)|
| 0:53:29| Page 2 and page 3 of this handout is just another presentation that summarizes all of the design options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3209)|
| 0:53:46| that we just went over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3226)|
| 0:53:49| So rather than trying to explain it to you by just looking at this one page,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3229)|
| 0:53:53| which is relatively packed with information and perhaps not as easy to understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3233)|
| 0:53:58| that's why I broke it out into the PowerPoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3238)|
| 0:54:01| There's not anything new on these two pages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3241)|
| 0:54:05| It's just presented in a different format.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3245)|
| 0:54:08| So unless anybody has objection, I'm just going to pass over these pages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3248)|
| 0:54:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3264)|
| 0:54:26| Page 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3266)|
| 0:54:28| Here we look at all of the different scenarios| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3268)|
| 0:54:33| and see what the implication is to the contribution under adopting the various different design options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3273)|
| 0:54:42| And as you can see, over the next ten years, the difference is almost nil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3282)|
| 0:54:49| And that's because it's not applying to all the current employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3289)|
| 0:54:53| It's applying to new people, which are going to have the smallest benefits over the next ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3293)|
| 0:54:58| It's going to be 15, 20, 30 years before those new people comprise the majority of the liability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3298)|
| 0:55:04| and until the current unfunded liability is projected to be paid off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3304)|
| 0:55:11| So what this does not show is the separation of risk between the city and between the employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3311)|
| 0:55:23| In other words, if you looked at this and you looked at the D.C. only option,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3323)|
| 0:55:28| which happens to be the black line, it's the dark brown line with the circle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3328)|
| 0:55:33| it's the second highest of the lines out on the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3333)|
| 0:55:36| And you say, well, from the city's perspective, that's not helping us as much as some of the other options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3336)|
| 0:55:42| In that option, however, the city is taking all the investment risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3342)|
| 0:55:45| So by the time you get there, I can say with confidence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3345)|
| 0:55:49| the city's contribution is going to be 6% employee, 8% for the general government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3349)|
| 0:55:56| and 10% for the fire and police because that's the way it's designed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3356)|
| 0:55:59| and there's not any investment risk on the city under that option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3359)|
| 0:56:02| I'm not suggesting that's the best option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3362)|
| 0:56:04| I'm just trying to explain that under that option, all the risk is getting moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3364)|
| 0:56:09| Under the hybrid options, there's going to be a lot less variability in the contribution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3369)|
| 0:56:15| as the risk is being shared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3375)|
| 0:56:18| So it's not going to be as volatile as the current all DB option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3378)|
| 0:56:23| So as you look at these and you try to see what the difference are in the cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3383)|
| 0:56:28| don't just focus on the cost difference, but also consider how much risk is being shared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3388)|
| 0:56:35| And if you believe that's a desirable option, take that into account as you're considering these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3395)|
| 0:56:41| not just the absolute dollar amounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3401)|
| 0:56:44| Now, the next slide, page 5, shows the same type projection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3404)|
| 0:56:54| with a 6.5% assumption instead of 7 3 8's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3414)|
| 0:56:59| Now, some people think 7 3 8's is too high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3419)|
| 0:57:03| Some people think 7 3 8's is too low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3423)|
| 0:57:06| My experience has been, regardless of what you think the assumption should be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3426)|
| 0:57:15| currently the pension plan is comprised of about 65% inactive liability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3435)|
| 0:57:23| which are people that no longer work at the city, retirees, Board of Education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3443)|
| 0:57:29| Plan F, deferred vestiges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3449)|
| 0:57:32| That's a lot of people that are getting monthly payments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3452)|
| 0:57:36| That's where that $40 million a year is coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3456)|
| 0:57:40| So, arguably, the more people you have in pay status,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3460)|
| 0:57:46| the more consistent you'd like your income to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3466)|
| 0:57:49| the more conservative you might want to be on the investments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3469)|
| 0:57:53| Now, I've had many discussions with Mr. Cherry, with the pension board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3473)|
| 0:57:57| of the implications of where we are, of where we might want to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3477)|
| 0:58:01| One of the possible options is to invest relatively more conservatively,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3481)|
| 0:58:07| and I don't think anybody is suggesting we go in and change the investment policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3487)|
| 0:58:10| and switch up all the investments tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3490)|
| 0:58:13| But if the investment policy was gradually changed over the next 10, 15, 20, 30 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3493)|
| 0:58:19| 6.5% might be the expected rate of return,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3499)|
| 0:58:23| which would be expected, though, a lower rate of return to create less volatility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3503)|
| 0:58:29| which means less variation in contribution for the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3509)|
| 0:58:33| and also less risk for the employee to the extent the employee has any risk in a hybrid plan option, for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3513)|
| 0:58:42| So, you know, you can look at this slide and say, I don't like this slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3522)|
| 0:58:47| I like the other slide better because the other slide has lower numbers on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3527)|
| 0:58:51| But what you can't directly see is the other slide with the higher 7 and 3 8's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3531)|
| 0:58:57| also assumes more equity exposure, more risk, potentially greater returns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3537)|
| 0:59:05| Which one is the right answer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3545)|
| 0:59:08| You know, that's somebody's decision, not mine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3548)|
| 0:59:10| but I've certainly been talking to the pension board about it, to the investment manager,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3550)|
| 0:59:15| and it's something that's going to be an ongoing discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3555)|
| 0:59:18| It's not directly part of this redesigned discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3558)|
| 0:59:23| However, I had to make some assumption for the projections, some assumption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3563)|
| 0:59:30| If you say, what is this going to cost if we do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3570)|
| 0:59:33| What is this going to cost if we do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3573)|
| 0:59:36| Well, I've assumed a base return for this and for the other slides that you're going to see of 6.5%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3576)|
| 0:59:43| which I think is a reasonable assumption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3583)|
| 0:59:46| Now, if you guys go back and say, gee, I want to see this at different rates of return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3586)|
| 0:59:50| I want to see this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3590)|
| 0:59:51| I want to see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3591)|
| 0:59:52| I mean, those are all going to be parts of discussion, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3592)|
| 0:59:54| and back and forth over the next several weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3594)|
| 0:59:56| which I'll be pleased to provide whatever information you'd like to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3596)|
| 1:00:00| But that's at least some of the thinking behind why I presented the information the way I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3600)|
| 1:00:05| You told Mr. Wallace it was 5.3% over the last ten years on average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3605)|
| 1:00:08| That was the actual historical return for ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3608)|
| 1:00:12| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3612)|
| 1:00:14| Which would be a higher line than all of these we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3614)|
| 1:00:17| 5.3% would be a higher contribution rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3617)|
| 1:00:22| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3622)|
| 1:00:23| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3623)|
| 1:00:24| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3624)|
| 1:00:25| If we assume 5.3%, that's a lower return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3625)|
| 1:00:27| That means higher contributions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3627)|
| 1:00:28| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3628)|
| 1:00:30| Councilman Wallace, is that an old ladder to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3630)|
| 1:00:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3633)|
| 1:00:34| I anticipated his follow-up question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3634)|
| 1:00:42| May I proceed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3642)|
| 1:00:43| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3643)|
| 1:00:47| Well, the 6% employee contribution, if I understand what you're saying, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3647)|
| 1:00:55| I'm not quite sure I understand what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3655)|
| 1:00:58| To get their return and to get their payout, that's going to require more contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3658)|
| 1:01:03| That's what we're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3663)|
| 1:01:04| Because the rate of return is going to be less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3664)|
| 1:01:07| And to get their payout per month, it's going to require more of their dollars in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3667)|
| 1:01:12| Not more of the employee dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3672)|
| 1:01:14| More of the city dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3674)|
| 1:01:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3675)|
| 1:01:16| To hit their.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3676)|
| 1:01:17| Nobody has suggested under any of these scenarios that the employees would be contributing anything except 6% of pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3677)|
| 1:01:24| I'm not saying somebody might not suggest that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3684)|
| 1:01:26| But under these scenarios, it's 6% fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3686)|
| 1:01:29| Is that 6% fixed too, Mr. Lyons?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3689)|
| 1:01:32| I mean, that's a number back to your Supreme Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3692)|
| 1:01:36| That's off the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3696)|
| 1:01:37| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3697)|
| 1:01:38| I think that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3698)|
| 1:01:39| I think Blackwell covers for the employees that rate of return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3699)|
| 1:01:42| For current employees, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3702)|
| 1:01:43| But this is only applying to future here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3703)|
| 1:01:46| So these could be, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3706)|
| 1:01:47| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3707)|
| 1:01:48| If you guys looked at this and said, hey, we want to, you know, 8% for employees and let's see those projections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3708)|
| 1:01:53| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3713)|
| 1:01:54| I mean, we can run that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3714)|
| 1:01:58| Again, over the next 10 or 15 years, the majority of this line that's being spiked doesn't have to do with new employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3718)|
| 1:02:07| It has to do with the unfunded liability that we already have that's largely due to what happened in 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3727)|
| 1:02:13| And so that's kind of we're dealing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3733)|
| 1:02:15| We're not trying to look 10 years out and say, how do we dramatically reduce that line?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3735)|
| 1:02:21| Because that's just without reducing benefits for current employees, you can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3741)|
| 1:02:25| And because of Blackwell, that, you know, unless somebody is willing to challenge that, we don't have much options there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3745)|
| 1:02:34| But what we can do is try to make some changes to reduce the risk, to share the risk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3754)|
| 1:02:39| to try to ensure that we don't have a repeat of what happened in 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3759)|
| 1:02:44| What makes you think that we're going to put $40 million a year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3764)|
| 1:02:47| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3767)|
| 1:02:48| Got a line here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3768)|
| 1:02:49| Councilman Graves recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3769)|
| 1:02:50| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3770)|
| 1:02:52| With what you just said, do I understand that if we did not hire another employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3772)|
| 1:02:58| that this line that I'm looking at is going to continue to go up for 20 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3778)|
| 1:03:04| We'll have a liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3784)|
| 1:03:05| This line represents new employees and current employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3785)|
| 1:03:09| If we didn't hire any more employees, you've still got a significant $130 million or whatever it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3789)|
| 1:03:17| unfunded liability that is going to have to be funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3797)|
| 1:03:21| So even if you didn't let any more people into the system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3801)|
| 1:03:24| you've still got a significant unfunded liability to pay for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3804)|
| 1:03:27| And that runs about how much a year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3807)|
| 1:03:30| It goes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3810)|
| 1:03:31| It goes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3811)|
| 1:03:32| I mean, you know, if you did a flat amortization over 30 years, you know, maybe it's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3812)|
| 1:03:37| depending on what the interest rate is, $25 million a year, $27 million a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3817)|
| 1:03:41| You know, you use these smoothing options and other things, it starts out lower and it gets higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3821)|
| 1:03:46| So that just kind of depends on all the various assumptions that we use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3826)|
| 1:03:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3831)|
| 1:03:52| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3832)|
| 1:04:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3842)|
| 1:04:05| This next page shows for new employees under the various scenarios that we've put forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3845)|
| 1:04:16| I started to say proposed, and let me emphasize I'm not proposing anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3856)|
| 1:04:20| All I'm doing is saying here are some design options for your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3860)|
| 1:04:26| For new employees, if we said what is the expected cost per year if we didn't have any unfunded liability?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3866)|
| 1:04:39| So if we get out 30 years from now and we meet all our assumptions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3879)|
| 1:04:43| what would we be expecting to put into the plan each year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3883)|
| 1:04:47| For the general government, you can see I included the first column because that is the assumptions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3887)|
| 1:04:54| that we used in 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3894)|
| 1:04:57| Those are the assumptions before the experience study, which the experience study assumptions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3897)|
| 1:05:04| the big change is the 7 3 8 discount rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3904)|
| 1:05:08| We also made some other changes to turnover, mortality, a few other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3908)|
| 1:05:11| But the discount rate was the big change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3911)|
| 1:05:14| If we were using the 2011 assumptions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3914)|
| 1:05:20| we'd be looking at long-term city contributions of about 6% of pay for the general government plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3920)|
| 1:05:29| Under the experience study assumptions with the 7 3 8s, with the new mortality and so forth, it's about 7.7, 7.69.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3929)|
| 1:05:41| Now, as I said, looking at the various alternatives and the projections, I've considered 6.5% as a baseline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3941)|
| 1:05:49| So if we change the current plan assumptions, not the provisions, just the assumptions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3949)|
| 1:05:56| we're looking at about 10% of pay, ongoing cost, current plan with all the risk remaining with the employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3956)|
| 1:06:04| I mean, I'm sorry, with the city under the current plan provisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3964)|
| 1:06:08| So the 10% number under the city contributions is kind of the starting comparison point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3968)|
| 1:06:18| which is really the third column.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3978)|
| 1:06:21| As you look to the right, you see these other numbers, 6% to 7%, the last number being 8%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3981)|
| 1:06:29| Since I initially did this chart, scenario five, I was estimating it initially saying, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3989)|
| 1:06:37| if it's a D.C. account and you always get at least what the D.C. account is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=3997)|
| 1:06:41| then the contribution should be about the same, 8% of pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4001)|
| 1:06:45| That actually is not the case because if somebody terminates as a non-vest or as a vested employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4005)|
| 1:06:52| and takes a refund, just like the current plan design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4012)|
| 1:06:55| they would get a refund of employee contributions under the D.B.D.C. max.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4015)|
| 1:07:00| So that total cost ends up being closer to 7% of pay, not 8% of pay under scenario five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4020)|
| 1:07:13| What was at the bottom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4033)|
| 1:07:14| When does that adjust to down at the bottom, total expected cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4034)|
| 1:07:18| It changes that 14%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4038)|
| 1:07:20| What does that do to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4040)|
| 1:07:21| Thirteen percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4041)|
| 1:07:23| Thirteen percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4043)|
| 1:07:24| The number at the bottom is really the total city contribution plus the total two lines of the employee contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4044)|
| 1:07:34| So, yeah, that would go down to 13% from 14%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4054)|
| 1:07:39| Similarly, on page seven, for the fire and police,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4059)|
| 1:07:43| 22% of pay would be the current plan provisions using a 6.5% assumption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4063)|
| 1:07:51| The other alternative plan design options range from just over 7% of pay up to 13.7%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4071)|
| 1:08:02| almost 14% of pay in the modified current.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4082)|
| 1:08:06| Now, again, I think there's going to be a lot of back and forth with the various plan provisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4086)|
| 1:08:12| so I would encourage you not to look at these particular numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4092)|
| 1:08:15| and start making any judgments about which plan design you think may be the best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4095)|
| 1:08:20| Any of these plan designs can be either made relatively more expensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4100)|
| 1:08:26| or relatively less expensive depending on how the plan provisions are tweaked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4106)|
| 1:08:30| the retirement age, the retirement factor, you know, the COLA, et cetera, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4110)|
| 1:08:35| So I think it's more important at this stage to figure out which design option you feel like is most viable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4115)|
| 1:08:45| and then we can start looking at those provisions and saying, well, if you do this, what's the cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4125)|
| 1:08:50| If you do this, what's the projected benefit to the employee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4130)|
| 1:08:54| This is merely to give you a starting kind of comparison just to give you a little flavor for what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4134)|
| 1:09:03| Flavor sounds great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4143)|
| 1:09:05| The last, excuse me, I'm not going to take time to go through the last two pages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4145)|
| 1:09:10| They're showing up sideways on my screen anyway, which isn't particularly helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4150)|
| 1:09:15| The last two pages just run through a couple scenarios for a 30-year employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4155)|
| 1:09:21| based on the provisions that I've suggested to start with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4161)|
| 1:09:25| Since my expectation is we're going to have some back and forth on the various provisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4165)|
| 1:09:30| these numbers on this slide may end up being not as meaningful or helpful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4170)|
| 1:09:36| until we get closer to the point where people are actually getting some provisions firmed up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4176)|
| 1:09:40| and saying, well, this is what we really think we want to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4180)|
| 1:09:43| and therefore, you know, now show us what's going to happen to a 20-year employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4183)|
| 1:09:47| a 30-year employee that retires at this age or this age or et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4187)|
| 1:09:52| So that concludes really my prepared comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4192)|
| 1:09:56| but, of course, I'm pleased to try to answer any further questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4196)|
| 1:10:00| or any questions that we can't answer in this context to go back to the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4200)|
| 1:10:06| and put Megan to work so she can answer them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4206)|
| 1:10:09| Councilman Gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4209)|
| 1:10:11| I do have a question on, I guess, each one of the plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4211)|
| 1:10:14| What does it cost the city to run the existing plan, you know, as of today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4214)|
| 1:10:20| I mean, what are the total costs that we're having to pay for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4220)|
| 1:10:23| And then how does that relate to each one of these different situations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4223)|
| 1:10:27| Is it the same or is it going to cost us more or less?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4227)|
| 1:10:30| What is it that we have to pay to run these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4230)|
| 1:10:32| The current cost of the plan can be thought of as two different components.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4232)|
| 1:10:38| One is the cost of benefits being accrued by current employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4238)|
| 1:10:43| which is let's call it about 11 percent of pay for all employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4243)|
| 1:10:47| That's the fire and police and general government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4247)|
| 1:10:51| So that would be six and a half, seven million dollars, let's call it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4251)|
| 1:10:57| Any contribution, the $13 million that's projected in the upcoming fiscal year budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4257)|
| 1:11:05| if $7 million, which is approximately the cost of benefits being earned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4265)|
| 1:11:09| the remainder of it, $6 million, is going toward that $130 million deficit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4269)|
| 1:11:15| the unfunded liability that's sitting out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4275)|
| 1:11:18| So 11 percent of pay is if you do all of the factors being equal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4278)|
| 1:11:23| that's kind of the ongoing expected cost without, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4283)|
| 1:11:27| in addition to this unfunded liability that's going to have to be paid for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4287)|
| 1:11:31| What I'm talking about is the administrative cost in terms of what does it cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4291)|
| 1:11:35| Okay. Not the benefit component, but the administrative cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4295)|
| 1:11:38| Right. And is it different for each one of the plans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4298)|
| 1:11:41| Mike, do you want to address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4301)|
| 1:11:46| And how is that determined?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4306)|
| 1:11:49| Would you mind to come down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4309)|
| 1:11:53| I know we're not going to be able to hear you from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4313)|
| 1:12:04| If you'll just identify yourself for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4324)|
| 1:12:08| Mike Cherry, the Executive Director of the Pension System.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4328)|
| 1:12:11| The expenses, certainly when we're looking at the expenses of the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4331)|
| 1:12:14| we divide into three little sections real quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4334)|
| 1:12:16| They're just literally the administrative expenses for running the office, doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4336)|
| 1:12:21| And that has in the past been around $250,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4341)|
| 1:12:24| We did add an employee this year, so that would be closer to $300,000 in round numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4344)|
| 1:12:30| And then we have our professional expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4350)|
| 1:12:32| That's what we pay our attorneys, actuaries, auditors, those expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4352)|
| 1:12:38| And they're running, not on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4358)|
| 1:12:41| but I want to say they've been a little higher than what they have normally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4361)|
| 1:12:46| but around a couple of hundred thousand dollars a year in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4366)|
| 1:12:49| And then thirdly, and the largest section of those expenses, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4369)|
| 1:12:54| are the fees that we pay our investment managers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4374)|
| 1:12:58| And those fees are essentially set by the contracts that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4378)|
| 1:13:03| And they're running at around $3 million currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4383)|
| 1:13:08| So those are the expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4388)|
| 1:13:10| In total, what would that be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4390)|
| 1:13:12| $3.5 million or so, $3.6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4392)|
| 1:13:16| As far as the percentage of the total, what is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4396)|
| 1:13:21| That would be what about, I'm going to say, 75 basis points or three-quarters of a percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4401)|
| 1:13:28| And how does that compare to other plans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4408)|
| 1:13:31| Are we high, are we low, are we medium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4411)|
| 1:13:33| Let me, Alan, do you have any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4413)|
| 1:13:36| For this size plan, you know, 60 to 70 basis points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4416)|
| 1:13:39| which I think is about where they are, is not out of line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4419)|
| 1:13:43| I mean, that seems to be, you know, not uncommon range to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4423)|
| 1:13:47| Are administrative costs, are they looked at every year in terms of what we are spending?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4427)|
| 1:13:54| Is this something that's reviewed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4434)|
| 1:13:55| And who reviews it, I guess?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4435)|
| 1:13:57| I guess that's my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4437)|
| 1:13:58| Well, we do look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4438)|
| 1:14:00| And certainly we give reports annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4440)|
| 1:14:02| And we have what I refer to as a budget or a financial plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4442)|
| 1:14:05| which we're putting together for the next fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4445)|
| 1:14:09| Again, the biggest portion of that has to do with those investment expenditures to our managers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4449)|
| 1:14:14| which, again, is not something that we control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4454)|
| 1:14:17| Typically, in the contract, the basis for determining those costs is in the contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4457)|
| 1:14:25| in terms of the market value that they manage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4465)|
| 1:14:29| So what you're saying is we're spending three and a half plus million a year to administer the plan, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4469)|
| 1:14:36| And would that be the same for each one of these plans that you're talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4476)|
| 1:14:41| I mean, the hybrids and the, would it be the same amount of money for each plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4481)|
| 1:14:46| I'm trying to think if we had both the current plan and an additional plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4486)|
| 1:14:51| The investment expenses comprise the largest portion of the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4491)|
| 1:14:55| And I expect those would be similar under any one of the hybrid options of the modified DB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4495)|
| 1:15:02| The expenses might be a bit different under the defined contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4502)|
| 1:15:07| Sometimes those are paid by the sponsor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4507)|
| 1:15:10| Sometimes they're paid for by the employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4510)|
| 1:15:14| So that discussion would have to be had at some future time if that was considered to be a viable alternative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4514)|
| 1:15:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4522)|
| 1:15:24| Councilman Delvaux.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4524)|
| 1:15:29| As I understand it, almost half or 47% of the employees are over the age of 45,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4529)|
| 1:15:37| and so marching towards that retirement goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4537)|
| 1:15:40| Does that affect the charter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4540)|
| 1:15:42| That's all taken into account in your calculations of what an actuary does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4542)|
| 1:15:46| You look at the work career and the lifespan and the whatever, the age of the persons involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4546)|
| 1:15:52| Yes, sir, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4552)|
| 1:15:55| So that those numbers don't change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4555)|
| 1:15:57| What affects the cost chart or the cost shortfall chart that you've projected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4557)|
| 1:16:04| whether it's at 8%, seven and a quarter, three-eighths or six and a half,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4564)|
| 1:16:09| is really the difference in investment performance and where we are now in terms of market value of assets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4569)|
| 1:16:18| versus benefits owed, so to speak, or accrued to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4578)|
| 1:16:22| Is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4582)|
| 1:16:23| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4583)|
| 1:16:24| And that number is not really changeable, I take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4584)|
| 1:16:27| I mean, in other words, that's your best guess as an actuary what the costs paid out are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4587)|
| 1:16:33| and you're applying that to where the assets are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4593)|
| 1:16:36| Yes, to the extent that I'm determining the liabilities, the turnover, retirement, mortality, salary scale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4596)|
| 1:16:46| all those things are relatively predictable and don't produce large gain losses on the whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4606)|
| 1:16:53| It's the discount rate that is highly variable and produces the biggest gain losses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4613)|
| 1:16:59| and so that's kind of, again, kind of what's led us to where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4619)|
| 1:17:04| And if your chart shows that we have to put in $45 million in a particular year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4624)|
| 1:17:08| and the city doesn't have that money, what happens to your chart?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4628)|
| 1:17:11| It just shifts upward in terms of the shortfall is now greater,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4631)|
| 1:17:15| so the amount needed in the next 22 or 24 years to 2036, that's just not the kind of the year where it starts to drop off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4635)|
| 1:17:24| Right, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4644)|
| 1:17:25| To the extent you get to a year and the recommended contribution is not deposited,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4645)|
| 1:17:29| then obviously that shortfall just gets deferred to future years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4649)|
| 1:17:35| So the chart goes upward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4655)|
| 1:17:37| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4657)|
| 1:17:41| And I think there's an additional issue with that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4661)|
| 1:17:44| If I understand the charter correctly, the way it's written,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4664)|
| 1:17:49| it doesn't really allow much compromise between, you know, if this is what the recommended contribution is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4669)|
| 1:17:56| and the pension board or the administration comes back to me and says, well, we can't contribute this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4676)|
| 1:18:02| You know, we can have some discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4682)|
| 1:18:04| You can tweak some assumptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4684)|
| 1:18:06| But as I understand the way things are currently written,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4686)|
| 1:18:08| the city doesn't really have a whole lot of flexibility in terms of whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4688)|
| 1:18:11| or not they're going to contribute the recommended contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4691)|
| 1:18:14| And if the city puts on a charter amendment a change in the plan that either requires greater employee contributions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4694)|
| 1:18:26| less COLA, higher retirement ages, something that changes this balance of cost to the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4706)|
| 1:18:34| and the voters say that's what they want, isn't that the plan you have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4714)|
| 1:18:38| regardless of what the Supreme Court said in an unrelated case in 1985,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4718)|
| 1:18:43| that if the voters change the charter of this city, isn't that the plan you have to administer as an actuary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4723)|
| 1:18:51| I mean, to the extent the voters make a change and the administration asks me to tell them what the cost is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4731)|
| 1:18:58| of course, I will calculate those numbers to the extent groups decide to contest that, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4738)|
| 1:19:05| That's out of your hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4745)|
| 1:19:06| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4746)|
| 1:19:07| That's out of my hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4747)|
| 1:19:08| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4748)|
| 1:19:09| Now, if the city comes to me and, you know, I have had groups that have said, not the city of Knoxville, let me clarify,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4749)|
| 1:19:15| but I have had other groups that have said, can you use these assumptions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4755)|
| 1:19:18| These are the assumptions we want you to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4758)|
| 1:19:20| And I say, I don't think those are reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4760)|
| 1:19:22| And they say, well, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4762)|
| 1:19:24| We respect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4764)|
| 1:19:25| But use them anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4765)|
| 1:19:26| Then I present the numbers they want and right beside it I put the numbers that I say, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4766)|
| 1:19:31| if you use my recommendation assumptions, this is what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4771)|
| 1:19:35| That would just mask the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4775)|
| 1:19:36| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4776)|
| 1:19:37| False assumptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4777)|
| 1:19:38| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4778)|
| 1:19:42| And the problem we experienced in 2008 is once you reduce the base amount in the account,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4782)|
| 1:19:48| then a percentage growth is on a smaller base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4788)|
| 1:19:51| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4791)|
| 1:19:52| So that's why you're that much further behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4792)|
| 1:19:54| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4794)|
| 1:19:55| If you lost 26% in 2008 or some number like that, you might have to gain 58% or something to get back to even.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4795)|
| 1:20:02| Some larger number, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4802)|
| 1:20:03| Some larger number to get back to just parity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4803)|
| 1:20:05| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4805)|
| 1:20:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4806)|
| 1:20:07| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4807)|
| 1:20:08| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4808)|
| 1:20:10| Yes, I'd like to get a response to that question about the Blackwell decision from either Attorney Frost or Attorney Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4810)|
| 1:20:21| That seems like a legal question that we may have to consider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4821)|
| 1:20:26| but I'd like to get one of them to answer that question that Councilman DellaVolpe just proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4826)|
| 1:20:33| Of course, I might add to that that I've asked that we get a pension attorney to address us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4833)|
| 1:20:39| because every case is decided on its facts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4839)|
| 1:20:42| and courts sometimes say things broadly that are different than what they've held on the specific facts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4842)|
| 1:20:49| and they might eat them in a later date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4849)|
| 1:20:51| In other words, you can't project all future activity from one case and some broad generalizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4851)|
| 1:20:57| But I'd love to hear from Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4857)|
| 1:20:59| And we'll have that discussion this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4859)|
| 1:21:01| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4861)|
| 1:21:02| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4862)|
| 1:21:03| This evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4863)|
| 1:21:04| Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4864)|
| 1:21:05| And what Mr. DellaVolpe says is exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4865)|
| 1:21:07| That's the way cases are decided on a case-by-case basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4867)|
| 1:21:11| But all we can do to predict what the court is going to do in the future is what it's done in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4871)|
| 1:21:18| And the Blackwell decision is a decision that was decided in 1981 by the Supreme Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4878)|
| 1:21:24| I think it's interesting to note that despite the fact that there has been a great deal of pressure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4884)|
| 1:21:29| to make changes in that decision, to distinguish that decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4889)|
| 1:21:33| to do something other than what that decision says, it's never happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4893)|
| 1:21:39| There is one case out there that was in 2010 where it was challenged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4899)|
| 1:21:45| and the court was able to distinguish it because what happened was you had a new pension plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4905)|
| 1:21:51| as opposed to you had people who opted into a new pension plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4911)|
| 1:21:55| and what they wanted to do was to get the best out of both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4915)|
| 1:21:58| And the court said, you can't have the best out of both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4918)|
| 1:22:00| If you choose to go into the new pension plan, you're going to be subject to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4920)|
| 1:22:04| But that really wasn't a change in the Blackwell decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4924)|
| 1:22:08| What the Blackwell decision, and it was a fairly narrow decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4928)|
| 1:22:12| What happened in Memphis-Shelby County was they had a pension plan that had been in effect since the 1930s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4932)|
| 1:22:19| They had changed it 40-some times since that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4939)|
| 1:22:24| But the change that they took under consideration at the time the Blackwell case came before the Supreme Court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4944)|
| 1:22:30| was a fairly small change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4950)|
| 1:22:33| What happened was they had been averaging it at five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4953)|
| 1:22:39| The salary that was computed they averaged at five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4959)|
| 1:22:43| Then they changed that to it was based on the last 12 months, just one year's worth of experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4963)|
| 1:22:50| They changed it to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4970)|
| 1:22:51| That's obviously more favorable to the employee because it doesn't get averaged down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4971)|
| 1:22:55| It's the most you ever made as the general rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4975)|
| 1:22:58| So they had it at 12 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4978)|
| 1:23:00| Then they changed it back just from that 12 months to three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4980)|
| 1:23:06| When they changed it back to three years, that means somebody who retires is going to be getting less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4986)|
| 1:23:12| And that's when they sued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4992)|
| 1:23:14| And when they sued, that was the only thing that they addressed really in this Blackwell case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4994)|
| 1:23:18| And they said for people who are vested, you can't reduce their benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=4998)|
| 1:23:24| Even this small amount, you can't reduce it by averaging by three years rather than by one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5004)|
| 1:23:31| And they very clearly said, they didn't use the word vested, but what they meant was vested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5011)|
| 1:23:37| And you can read the opinion yourself and see that the term that they mean is vested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5017)|
| 1:23:42| For vested employees, you cannot diminish their retirement benefits in any way, shape or form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5022)|
| 1:23:50| And they said that fairly clearly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5030)|
| 1:23:52| Chief Justice Harbison did in his opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5032)|
| 1:23:55| Now, it suggested that for those who are not vested but are in the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5035)|
| 1:24:01| that you can make changes if it is necessary to maintain actuarial stability, the issue that you raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5041)|
| 1:24:08| But they didn't say that with regard to vested employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5048)|
| 1:24:11| They didn't care whether you were maintaining actuarial stability or not, at least in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5051)|
| 1:24:17| Now, could you come with a different case and get them to change their mind?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5057)|
| 1:24:20| Maybe you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5060)|
| 1:24:21| Maybe you can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5061)|
| 1:24:22| We don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5062)|
| 1:24:23| And that's part of the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5063)|
| 1:24:24| When you're trying to design what you're going to do for the future, if you design a lawsuit, you've done a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5064)|
| 1:24:33| Number one, you've delayed the decision for multiple years, as you well know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5073)|
| 1:24:39| It's going to take a number of years to get that case before the Supreme Court and get a decision from the Supreme Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5079)|
| 1:24:47| All the while, you may be incurring significant liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5087)|
| 1:24:51| All the while, you darn well will be incurring attorneys' fees and expenses associated with that litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5091)|
| 1:24:58| When you get to the back end of that whole situation, you may prevail and you may not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5098)|
| 1:25:04| If you don't, not only do you have the delay, not only do you have the expense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5104)|
| 1:25:09| you also have the liability associated with your failure to win.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5109)|
| 1:25:13| So it's pretty important that you predict what the right outcome of the case is going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5113)|
| 1:25:18| if you choose to go the litigation route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5118)|
| 1:25:21| And my suggestion is that you might want to be conservative in how you predict that rather than hopeful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5121)|
| 1:25:29| I'm going to recognize Attorney Frost here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5129)|
| 1:25:32| I guess it's a continuation, I would assume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5132)|
| 1:25:35| Yes, briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5135)|
| 1:25:37| To answer Councilman Brown's question, I have not spoken with Mr. Swanson before this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5137)|
| 1:25:43| Approximately, I'm guessing, six or seven years ago before I held this position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5143)|
| 1:25:47| I had a very similar conversation to at least one or two, potentially three law directors ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5147)|
| 1:25:58| when some retirees were looking for some changes to their pension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5158)|
| 1:26:03| and had this discussion with the law director at this time, and I apologize,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5163)|
| 1:26:07| I don't remember if it was Morris Kaiser or Debbie Poplin or Michael Kelly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5167)|
| 1:26:12| and they referred me to the Blackwell decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5172)|
| 1:26:15| And the city attorney at that time had the opinion that you could not alter the benefits of those vested employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5175)|
| 1:26:29| and I read the case well as well and independently came to my own conclusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5189)|
| 1:26:35| Now, that doesn't mean that I'm not happy to, you know, dig that back out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5195)|
| 1:26:39| and see if there's a different interpretation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5199)|
| 1:26:41| But I just, you know, to follow up on your question and Mr. Swanson's remark,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5201)|
| 1:26:46| I looked at this a number of years ago when times were better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5206)|
| 1:26:52| and the pension was a lot more in better condition than it presently is due to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5212)|
| 1:26:57| market conditions that the city could not impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5217)|
| 1:27:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5221)|
| 1:27:02| That answers my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5222)|
| 1:27:03| I have one other question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5223)|
| 1:27:04| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5224)|
| 1:27:06| On page six, we have under the modified no rule of 80 and no drop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5226)|
| 1:27:12| Now, for the general public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5232)|
| 1:27:14| and those people who are not so involved in city benefits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5234)|
| 1:27:20| could somebody kind of talk about this rule of 80 and the drop rule?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5240)|
| 1:27:27| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5247)|
| 1:27:29| The rule of 80 was put in for the general government in about 2001, 2001,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5249)|
| 1:27:37| that said instead of having to wait until age 62 to retire, if you accumulated 80 points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5257)|
| 1:27:45| and you get one point for each year of age and one point for each year of service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5265)|
| 1:27:51| that you could retire with a full unreduced pension with no early retirement reduction factor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5271)|
| 1:27:57| So if you were 55 years old and had 25 years of service, your age plus your service is 80.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5277)|
| 1:28:05| Therefore, you could retire at 55,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5285)|
| 1:28:08| and the early retirement reduction that normally applies would not then apply to your benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5288)|
| 1:28:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5295)|
| 1:28:16| And if we have just in the future for new hires, and we don't have that, in terms of if you can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5296)|
| 1:28:25| in terms of savings in the future, what kind of savings are you talking about without that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5305)|
| 1:28:33| I mean, if you're talking about a plan, let's say, that costs 8 percent of pay and has no rule of 80,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5313)|
| 1:28:44| and then you say, well, let's put the rule of 80 in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5324)|
| 1:28:46| What's that going to cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5326)|
| 1:28:48| Maybe it's 9 percent of pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5328)|
| 1:28:49| I mean, it's not 15 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5329)|
| 1:28:51| It's not going to double the cost, but it's going to increase the cost maybe 10 percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5331)|
| 1:28:56| or something over what you had before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5336)|
| 1:29:00| You know, I'm not sure there's any one benefit you can look at and say, well, gee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5340)|
| 1:29:05| that's the one that we shouldn't have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5345)|
| 1:29:07| But I think there's a combination of a lot of things that have combined together to create some higher expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5347)|
| 1:29:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5354)|
| 1:29:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5355)|
| 1:29:16| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5356)|
| 1:29:17| Governor Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5357)|
| 1:29:22| I guess I'll go back to a couple of references you've made to the charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5362)|
| 1:29:26| and how limiting and in what ways are you limited by the wording in the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5366)|
| 1:29:32| that the pension is in the charter and how are you restricted by that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5372)|
| 1:29:37| And would it be a benefit to take it out of the charter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5377)|
| 1:29:40| And would that give you, in a sense, more latitude to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5380)|
| 1:29:44| I mean, it seems very late in response to the 2008 drop to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5384)|
| 1:29:49| If you didn't have the limitation of the charter, would that be a benefit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5389)|
| 1:29:53| Talk to that a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5393)|
| 1:29:54| The limitation that I was referring to in the charter largely has to do to ensure that the city contributes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5394)|
| 1:30:01| the recommended contribution regardless of any other factors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5401)|
| 1:30:05| So there have been some states, Illinois, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5405)|
| 1:30:09| who felt that they couldn't make the recommended contribution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5409)|
| 1:30:12| even though their funding situation is much, much worse than Knoxville's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5412)|
| 1:30:16| And they've had years where they simply just didn't make a contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5416)|
| 1:30:19| The charter language is written such that the city simply just doesn't have that alternative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5419)|
| 1:30:25| So that does not limit me, but it certainly does, you know, if you want to say encumbrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5425)|
| 1:30:31| I mean, it certainly puts a limitation on the administration, the budget committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5431)|
| 1:30:35| as they're trying to decide, you know, how are we going to handle this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5435)|
| 1:30:40| Speak to that, Bill, can you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5440)|
| 1:30:42| I mean, how does the charter put limitations on you and the administration and on the budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5442)|
| 1:30:47| Well, if the same requirements could have been by ordinance as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5447)|
| 1:30:52| anything in here could be most cities, the vast majority, I would say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5452)|
| 1:30:55| have pension described in ordinance and not in the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5455)|
| 1:30:59| which means there can be a much more rapid reaction by council to make alterations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5459)|
| 1:31:06| and they would not be taken to the voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5466)|
| 1:31:09| But in terms of what the actual specified elements are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5469)|
| 1:31:13| it doesn't matter whether they're in the charter or in the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5473)|
| 1:31:15| I mean, they're there either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5475)|
| 1:31:17| They can just be changed a lot more efficiently if they're not in the charter and they're in the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5477)|
| 1:31:21| So if we weren't limited by the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5481)|
| 1:31:24| then we could have made some changes a little bit quicker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5484)|
| 1:31:27| and responded to this loss a little bit more effectively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5487)|
| 1:31:30| I mean, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5490)|
| 1:31:31| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5491)|
| 1:31:32| You're still bound by Blackwell, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5492)|
| 1:31:34| Bound by Blackwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5494)|
| 1:31:35| But still the council could make changes much more quickly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5495)|
| 1:31:39| and not be limited to now for charter change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5499)|
| 1:31:42| You have to be in the statewide election cycle, so you have to wait two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5502)|
| 1:31:45| It's like right here, you have to wait two years if it's not addressed in June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5505)|
| 1:31:48| If it's in ordinance, you change it when you change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5508)|
| 1:31:52| And that's something that I want to talk about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5512)|
| 1:31:54| that we should and I think that ought to be part of our discussions over our next meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5514)|
| 1:31:58| is an option of looking at taking the pension out of the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5518)|
| 1:32:02| Because it seems very impractical to deal with these problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5522)|
| 1:32:05| We're on this deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5525)|
| 1:32:07| We're all forced to make, you know, and then we're still subject to the voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5527)|
| 1:32:11| And we still can't make decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5531)|
| 1:32:13| And I think that we should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5533)|
| 1:32:15| I think that ought to be some serious consideration as we move these discussions forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5535)|
| 1:32:19| as Dave indicated tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5539)|
| 1:32:22| Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5542)|
| 1:32:25| Let me just make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5545)|
| 1:32:26| Yeah, let me go to Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5546)|
| 1:32:29| I just want to make a brief, very brief response to Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5549)|
| 1:32:33| You know, in our charter, the pension takes up two-thirds of the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5553)|
| 1:32:37| But, in fact, Article II, Section 225, does exactly what you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5557)|
| 1:32:42| It allows the city to set up a pension system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5562)|
| 1:32:45| And that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5565)|
| 1:32:46| That's really all you need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5566)|
| 1:32:47| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5567)|
| 1:32:48| So, but to get it out of the charter, you have to go this same route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5568)|
| 1:32:52| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5572)|
| 1:32:53| But that could be the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5573)|
| 1:32:55| That is an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5575)|
| 1:32:57| They've thrown out their options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5577)|
| 1:32:58| I'm throwing out a option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5578)|
| 1:32:59| That would be an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5579)|
| 1:33:00| Take it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5580)|
| 1:33:01| And then we could move through this process a little more efficiently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5581)|
| 1:33:07| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5587)|
| 1:33:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5588)|
| 1:33:10| Maybe I didn't hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5590)|
| 1:33:12| Mayor Brown asked about the drop program and the Rule of 80.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5592)|
| 1:33:15| I heard the definition for Rule of 80, but I must have missed the drop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5595)|
| 1:33:20| No, ma'am, you didn't miss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5600)|
| 1:33:22| I finished the Rule of 80, and then there wasn't a follow-up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5602)|
| 1:33:25| And it moved on, and so I didn't stop everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5605)|
| 1:33:28| But I'll be happy to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5608)|
| 1:33:30| The drop is a deferred retirement option plan or option program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5610)|
| 1:33:36| which would allow a member, either in the general government or fire and police,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5616)|
| 1:33:41| up to two years before they are ready to retire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5621)|
| 1:33:45| Let's say somebody was 60 years old, and he was eligible for Rule of 80 in the general government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5625)|
| 1:33:51| and he said, well, you know, I think I'm getting a good pension right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5631)|
| 1:33:55| Let me lock my pension benefit in at $30,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5635)|
| 1:34:00| But I want to work two more years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5640)|
| 1:34:02| So he comes in and comes into the pension office and signs his paperwork,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5642)|
| 1:34:08| and then his pension benefits $30,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5648)|
| 1:34:11| And that's what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5651)|
| 1:34:12| But he works for two more years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5652)|
| 1:34:14| He doesn't get any pension dollars until he leaves employment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5654)|
| 1:34:20| at which time at age 62 in this scenario, he would get $60,000 approximately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5660)|
| 1:34:26| two years' worth of pension payments, plus his ongoing $30,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5666)|
| 1:34:30| plus adjustments for any COLAs that would have happened in the interim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5670)|
| 1:34:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5674)|
| 1:34:35| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5675)|
| 1:34:37| Councilman Del Valle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5677)|
| 1:34:38| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5678)|
| 1:34:40| I want to go back to Dan's question because I still haven't heard the answer that I think we all need to hear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5680)|
| 1:34:47| and it's one that we haven't obtained yet and we probably have to chase after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5687)|
| 1:34:53| If you make the Blackwell decision some kind of idol and you bow before it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5693)|
| 1:34:59| then everything that happens just turns out to be predestined,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5699)|
| 1:35:05| and we're really not a body representing the taxpayers of this community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5705)|
| 1:35:09| and the citizens of this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5709)|
| 1:35:11| And it's clear from what Mr. Swanson said that they weren't looking at changing COLA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5711)|
| 1:35:17| or retirement contributions by an employee or any of those aspects of a retirement plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5717)|
| 1:35:24| They were looking at reducing someone's benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5724)|
| 1:35:26| And the question before us, one of the questions is, how should we share this extra cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5726)|
| 1:35:32| Shouldn't the employees be pulling part of the laboring oar?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5732)|
| 1:35:36| I mean, we're paying right now three times, I think, what the employees are paying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5736)|
| 1:35:40| Aren't they about $4, $4.5 million, and we're paying $13 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5740)|
| 1:35:45| Isn't that the rough ballpark?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5745)|
| 1:35:50| Roughly $4 million to $13 million for the upcoming year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5750)|
| 1:35:52| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5752)|
| 1:35:53| And, you know, five, six years ago that was more like they were paying 40 percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5753)|
| 1:35:59| and we were paying 60 percent, but now it's gotten way out of whack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5759)|
| 1:36:02| And so I think that there are other both businesses and lawyers looking at this question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5762)|
| 1:36:09| not only in Tennessee, which we have to deal with because that's where the Blackwell decision comes from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5769)|
| 1:36:13| but around the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5773)|
| 1:36:14| And there are lots of cities that are faced not with just are we tweaking or adjusting a plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5774)|
| 1:36:19| but their economic survival or the sufficiency of the plan itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5779)|
| 1:36:26| which all the employees depend on for their benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5786)|
| 1:36:29| And so I don't think that we can leave out this huge chunk, the 2,300 people that are retired,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5789)|
| 1:36:35| the 1,530 people that are in the system right now working,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5795)|
| 1:36:39| and we're looking at the 100 people we're going to hire in 2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5799)|
| 1:36:43| I mean, I think that we have to take a broader look, and I think we need some help in looking at that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5803)|
| 1:36:48| because there are entities, I mean, right now TVA cut its COLA for like about two years for retirees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5808)|
| 1:36:54| and maybe that's challenging, maybe it isn't, but people are looking at ways to make these pension plans work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5814)|
| 1:37:02| Some companies have dumped defined pension plans and gone only to defined contribution plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5822)|
| 1:37:08| the 401K that you take with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5828)|
| 1:37:10| But, you know, okay, so the municipal government may have an interest in a defined benefit plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5830)|
| 1:37:15| because it helps, you know, hire people or retain them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5835)|
| 1:37:19| but there has to be some sensible cost limits to this thing, and we've got to find a way to deal with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5839)|
| 1:37:26| The money problem falls on this legislature, and we need to look at that for the benefit of all the citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5846)|
| 1:37:32| and I think we need outside help if we need it to look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5852)|
| 1:37:35| If you read the Blackwell case, it picked up the Pennsylvania rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5855)|
| 1:37:38| That was one line of cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5858)|
| 1:37:40| Pennsylvania seemed to be dealing with pensions a certain way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5860)|
| 1:37:43| and that's what they thought in, what was the year, 1981, I think Mr. Swanson said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5863)|
| 1:37:47| Are they still following that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5867)|
| 1:37:49| Has Pennsylvania tackled it and changed their mind?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5869)|
| 1:37:51| I mean, would we follow some adjustment to the rule?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5871)|
| 1:37:54| I think we need to look at that, because otherwise we're playing with the tail on a very big dog,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5874)|
| 1:38:00| and we're not solving the problem, and that's what we've got to do here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5880)|
| 1:38:04| So I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5884)|
| 1:38:05| Let me ask you, when you say we need to look at that, so as a layperson, explain to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5885)|
| 1:38:12| I mean, if I hear you right, you're advocating that we hire an attorney and challenge that suit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5892)|
| 1:38:16| No, no, I'm just saying that we get some advice from someone who's looked at this kind of problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5896)|
| 1:38:22| You know, we're frozen in time from 1981.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5902)|
| 1:38:25| We've got to look at what's happening both here and around the country and in Pennsylvania,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5905)|
| 1:38:29| where we adopted their rule, and see if this, you know, it may not be the totem pole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5909)|
| 1:38:35| In other words, courts do something called abitur dicta.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5915)|
| 1:38:39| That means we just said it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5919)|
| 1:38:41| But when you look at that case, the question that a later court looks at is what did they hold?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5921)|
| 1:38:46| What were the facts, and what was the holding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5926)|
| 1:38:48| And that's really the lesson of that case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5928)|
| 1:38:50| They said other things in getting there that they may or may not mean in a different context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5930)|
| 1:38:56| And we need help deciding where is the limits and the rules, and what can we tackle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5936)|
| 1:39:02| Because if we just tackle the 100 people we're going to hire in July 2013,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5942)|
| 1:39:07| we're pushing this problem down the pike and down the taxpayers' throats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5947)|
| 1:39:11| I don't see how that's a good service to anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5951)|
| 1:39:14| Mr. Brost, I'm glad to see you're alive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5954)|
| 1:39:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5956)|
| 1:39:17| Councilman Delvoppi, I'm sure you'll correct me if I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5957)|
| 1:39:20| Maybe not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5960)|
| 1:39:22| I guess this is following up to our conversation on Thursday or Friday of last week, I don't recall which,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5962)|
| 1:39:29| concern about possibly retaining a pension professional, so to speak, that I polled members of council about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5969)|
| 1:39:39| There are some people that wanted to see what happened tonight before they voted on that poll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5979)|
| 1:39:44| Is that where you're getting to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5984)|
| 1:39:46| No, I was just saying I think that that's an important constraint we have here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5986)|
| 1:39:49| If we start with the assumption that our hands are tied, then we've got three or four options here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5989)|
| 1:39:53| five options that make a little difference but not a ton of difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5993)|
| 1:39:57| We're trying to be fair to new hires and yet have a pension plan that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=5997)|
| 1:40:01| But those employees out there, they also want a sound pension plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6001)|
| 1:40:05| And if it ain't funded, somewhere the benefits are going to trail off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6005)|
| 1:40:09| We're going to start laying off people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6009)|
| 1:40:12| We're going to raise taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6012)|
| 1:40:13| We're going to cut services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6013)|
| 1:40:14| We're going to go bankrupt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6014)|
| 1:40:16| You know, we're going to be like Detroit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6016)|
| 1:40:17| There's $6 billion in the hole on their pension plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6017)|
| 1:40:20| That's nuts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6020)|
| 1:40:21| I mean, that's crazy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6021)|
| 1:40:22| So we're here at a point now where we can address this, hopefully with cooperation from the employees, to solve the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6022)|
| 1:40:28| Maybe they need to be looking at what they want out of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6028)|
| 1:40:31| But they ought to help us if at the end of the day you've got to pay this bill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6031)|
| 1:40:36| and they've got to help us pay it if we're going to keep these benefits the way they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6036)|
| 1:40:39| Mr. Chairperson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6039)|
| 1:40:41| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6041)|
| 1:40:42| If I could make a one ----| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6042)|
| 1:40:43| Hold on one second, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6043)|
| 1:40:45| Rob, you've still got your light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6045)|
| 1:40:46| Let me ----| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6046)|
| 1:40:47| I'll be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6047)|
| 1:40:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6048)|
| 1:40:49| I'll come right back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6049)|
| 1:40:50| I hear and understand your passion on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6050)|
| 1:40:54| What I'd ---- you know, I don't pretend to speak for an administration, council, anybody else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6054)|
| 1:41:00| but I'm pretty certain they don't want to undergo layoffs, tax increases, or anything like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6060)|
| 1:41:07| unless absolutely positively necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6067)|
| 1:41:09| There's been no discussion of that that I'm aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6069)|
| 1:41:12| But what I'd like to encourage those on council, if they've not yet replied to the question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6072)|
| 1:41:17| I emailed them late last week to try to do so, please, in the next 24 to 48 hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6077)|
| 1:41:22| to find out if this is something that there is a majority of council that wants to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6082)|
| 1:41:28| and what route they want to take in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6088)|
| 1:41:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6093)|
| 1:41:34| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6094)|
| 1:41:35| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6095)|
| 1:41:36| I think that there are, in fact, three states, Colorado, South Dakota, Minnesota,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6096)|
| 1:41:42| that have decreased the COLA for current retirees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6102)|
| 1:41:47| All of those are being challenged in court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6107)|
| 1:41:49| and I think there's several states around the country that are eagerly awaiting the outcomes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6109)|
| 1:41:54| to decide if they, too, want to pursue that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6114)|
| 1:41:57| Regardless of those outcomes, you know, they're not Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6117)|
| 1:42:00| and they don't have Blackwell to deal with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6120)|
| 1:42:02| and, you know, that may or may not give you some helpful information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6122)|
| 1:42:06| But certainly there are others out there that have that same consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6126)|
| 1:42:12| And the only other thing I guess I would add is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6132)|
| 1:42:14| that's one possibility that I applaud the council for considering all the different options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6134)|
| 1:42:21| Regardless of whether that's pursued or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6141)|
| 1:42:24| I think this other issue of do you consider a redesign option for the ballot and which one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6144)|
| 1:42:31| it's certainly not independent, but, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6151)|
| 1:42:34| it's something I hope doesn't get lost in the cross between, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6154)|
| 1:42:38| all the other discussions that are going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6158)|
| 1:42:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6160)|
| 1:42:41| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6161)|
| 1:42:42| Oh, I think that, you know, to Della Volpe's point, that's just one issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6162)|
| 1:42:46| You know, I think you wait and you see what else happens out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6166)|
| 1:42:51| You've got to deal with that's going to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6171)|
| 1:42:53| You can deal with today going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6173)|
| 1:42:55| That's one issue we've got to talk about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6175)|
| 1:42:57| and then you can deal with if you want to go back and look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6177)|
| 1:43:00| if you really want to look at the people that are on their current plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6180)|
| 1:43:05| I mean, you can change the plan now going forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6185)|
| 1:43:07| and you can continue to see what happens nationally on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6187)|
| 1:43:10| They don't have to make that decision today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6190)|
| 1:43:12| You can close the plan, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6192)|
| 1:43:14| You can close the plan, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6194)|
| 1:43:16| Right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6196)|
| 1:43:17| I mean, that's what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6197)|
| 1:43:18| You can close it to new entrants, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6198)|
| 1:43:20| That's what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6200)|
| 1:43:21| You either close the plan and start a new plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6201)|
| 1:43:24| I mean, that's what the city teachers did, whatever that was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6204)|
| 1:43:28| 81 or 2, whatever that was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6208)|
| 1:43:31| Yeah, you can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6211)|
| 1:43:32| But I think there's kind of two options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6212)|
| 1:43:34| You don't have to just look at, I mean, look at the current plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6214)|
| 1:43:40| or challenge it, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6220)|
| 1:43:43| Councilman Greer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6223)|
| 1:43:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6224)|
| 1:43:45| One of the things that might be of interest to council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6225)|
| 1:43:48| I know it's of interest to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6228)|
| 1:43:50| is that I was talking to Mintha Roach at KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6230)|
| 1:43:53| And KUB went through this back in the 90s where they closed their existing plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6233)|
| 1:43:57| and started a new one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6237)|
| 1:43:59| And I think it might be interesting to hear from her perspective what that did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6239)|
| 1:44:04| not only for the employees but also for KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6244)|
| 1:44:07| And I did have a discussion with her today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6247)|
| 1:44:09| and she said she'd be more than willing to come and present that to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6249)|
| 1:44:14| not only give us the written information but then be able to answer questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6254)|
| 1:44:18| And they're right here in our back door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6258)|
| 1:44:20| If that's a consideration at council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6260)|
| 1:44:24| I know it was good information for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6264)|
| 1:44:27| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6267)|
| 1:44:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6268)|
| 1:44:29| I, too, have discussed not only with Mintha Roach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6269)|
| 1:44:32| but some others changes that have been made to different plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6272)|
| 1:44:36| And I certainly think that the KUB model is one that we could look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6276)|
| 1:44:42| I'm not endorsing anybody's plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6282)|
| 1:44:44| and there are some others that I need to talk a little bit more in detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6284)|
| 1:44:49| But I do think that we have people in our city who are involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6289)|
| 1:44:54| perhaps in the private sector as well as the public sector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6294)|
| 1:44:58| that we could talk with and find out how they've handled this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6298)|
| 1:45:02| and not only from the perspective of the employer but the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6302)|
| 1:45:08| And that was one of the suggestions that Councilman DeLvopia brought up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6308)|
| 1:45:12| and I think those are all excellent ideas if you can get the private sector to come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6312)|
| 1:45:17| and it might be a little bit harder to get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6317)|
| 1:45:20| But if somebody knows somebody that's been through it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6320)|
| 1:45:23| I mean, I don't think we can get too much information here, that's for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6323)|
| 1:45:27| What's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6327)|
| 1:45:29| Yeah, but I'm talking about private sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6329)|
| 1:45:33| It's both from the employer and the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6333)|
| 1:45:36| Yeah, both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6336)|
| 1:45:38| And I've asked Rhonda Rice at the Chamber if they would check around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6338)|
| 1:45:42| and see if they have companies, because there are a lot of big companies in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6342)|
| 1:45:46| Some of them must have wrestled with this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6346)|
| 1:45:48| Obviously, the economic downturn crashed everyone's plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6348)|
| 1:45:52| And what are people doing to recover is an important question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6352)|
| 1:45:57| In the private sector, folks are not constrained by the same rules that you are in a governmental arena.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6357)|
| 1:46:05| So, for example, if this was a private plan, you could not only close the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6365)|
| 1:46:10| you could freeze the plan so nobody earned anything going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6370)|
| 1:46:15| And then if you wanted to give any benefit, then that would be at your discretion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6375)|
| 1:46:20| So, while I certainly would encourage you to gather whatever information you can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6380)|
| 1:46:24| just be aware that the rules that apply to corporate plans are vastly different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6384)|
| 1:46:30| than the rules that apply to governmental plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6390)|
| 1:46:32| And you say that even if we change the charter so that the plan is, for example, closed or frozen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6392)|
| 1:46:38| or whatever you mentioned happens in the private sector, doesn't the charter determine what the plan is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6398)|
| 1:46:43| I mean, the plan is what the charter allows it to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6403)|
| 1:46:45| Is that not true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6405)|
| 1:46:47| To the extent, you know, if you say Blackwell keeps you from changing provisions from current employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6407)|
| 1:46:53| for example, let's say you couldn't change the multiplier from 2.5 to 2.4, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6413)|
| 1:46:58| it would also, quote, unquote, protect from reducing it to zero,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6418)|
| 1:47:03| which is essentially what you can do in a corporate plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6423)|
| 1:47:06| but you can't do it in a private plan in Tennessee due to the Blackwell decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6426)|
| 1:47:10| Do you say that even though Blackwell said no employee has a permanent contract with the government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6430)|
| 1:47:16| and that they work under their arrangement with the government and appointment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6436)|
| 1:47:20| and they have civil service to protect them from unfair firings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6440)|
| 1:47:24| but they don't have a lifetime contract like a judge has?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6444)|
| 1:47:27| I'm just telling you that's my understanding of the rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6447)|
| 1:47:30| But if one of the attorneys wants to address that, I'd be happy for him to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6450)|
| 1:47:36| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6456)|
| 1:47:38| Vice Mayor, I just want to thank the mayor and this presentation tonight, Dr. Lyons and Mr. Pennington| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6458)|
| 1:47:45| and Councilman Sanders for what they've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6465)|
| 1:47:48| At least we're out ahead of the problem, before we have a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6468)|
| 1:47:53| So this is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6473)|
| 1:47:56| And I just wanted to make that statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6476)|
| 1:48:00| He can always calm a crowd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6480)|
| 1:48:08| Well, I thought he sounded like he was going to adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6488)|
| 1:48:13| He heard enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6493)|
| 1:48:14| I was ready to go, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6494)|
| 1:48:17| I just had a question for the people that formed these five different options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6497)|
| 1:48:24| Where exactly did these five options come from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6504)|
| 1:48:28| Were they sort of a reflection of our current system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6508)|
| 1:48:32| Because I think it would be good to have some, just some,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6512)|
| 1:48:35| I don't think we even need people to come in and talk to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6515)|
| 1:48:37| but just what else is out there, just so we have perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6517)|
| 1:48:40| Because I think there's certainly many companies that don't provide any contribution to any, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6520)|
| 1:48:47| I think that would be on one end of the scale versus a very rich, defined benefit plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6527)|
| 1:48:53| So I think for everyone involved, just to know what else is out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6533)|
| 1:48:57| because we're going to be talking about competition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6537)|
| 1:48:59| I think it would be good if we had, you know, I mean, I know what my law firm does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6539)|
| 1:49:04| You know, they match 50 percent up to 4 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6544)|
| 1:49:07| So match contribution of 2 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6547)|
| 1:49:10| Define contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6550)|
| 1:49:11| Define contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6551)|
| 1:49:12| That's what I get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6552)|
| 1:49:14| If they raise it to 8, I'd love it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6554)|
| 1:49:15| You know, I mean, so I think we should know what's out there in the private sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6555)|
| 1:49:20| And I would, I mean, was there, how were these five plans formed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6560)|
| 1:49:27| Well, I think first there was an assumption there would be a pension of some kind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6567)|
| 1:49:31| and that all possible permutations of pensions range from a defined contribution all the way to a defined benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6571)|
| 1:49:38| So basically we thought let's go pure defined benefit, pure defined contribution, and something in the middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6578)|
| 1:49:44| That would take all, that's assuming, again, that there is a city participation in the retirement of the employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6584)|
| 1:49:51| which is what would be across all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6591)|
| 1:49:54| We also made, took the existing, I think we've gotten a little bit away from the existing benefit structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6594)|
| 1:49:59| and decided to reduce that as well, that is we, by upping the retirement age in all cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6599)|
| 1:50:04| and increasing the years that you average for highest pay and removing the rule of 80 and those sorts of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6604)|
| 1:50:09| So those were the two sets of considerations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6609)|
| 1:50:11| A, reduce the benefit structure somewhat because it seemed quite rich and that it contributed to this whole issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6611)|
| 1:50:17| And B, assume that there would be city participation in the employee's retirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6617)|
| 1:50:21| and go across the entire range from, you know, from all employee bearing risk to all, to city bearing risk and in between.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6621)|
| 1:50:28| So in that sense we thought that still leaves lots of different ways to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6628)|
| 1:50:33| And, you know, for sure you could have just a match at whatever level or you could have it as a law firm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6633)|
| 1:50:39| but I think for purposes of discussion we drew those, we put the boundary sticks on those ends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6639)|
| 1:50:44| So, I mean, you didn't look at other cities or look at the private sector?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6644)|
| 1:50:48| I mean, these were just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6648)|
| 1:50:51| We looked a lot at other cities, I mean, to get some sense of the lay of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6651)|
| 1:50:55| I would say if there is a city in the country that varies from pretty much these parameters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6655)|
| 1:51:02| there are very, very few, would you not say that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6662)|
| 1:51:05| No, I would agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6665)|
| 1:51:06| One of the things we particularly looked at is, you know, however you structure the plan, the question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6666)|
| 1:51:14| what's the ultimate benefit to the employee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6674)|
| 1:51:16| Because the ultimate benefit is what drives the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6676)|
| 1:51:19| So how much benefit are we trying to get to the employees, question number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6679)|
| 1:51:24| And question number two is how much risk does the city want to retain, if any, in providing that ultimate benefit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6684)|
| 1:51:33| And so in coming up with these options, I did research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6693)|
| 1:51:36| I looked at what different states are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6696)|
| 1:51:38| I had several conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6698)|
| 1:51:39| I didn't go out and say, well, let's look at what they're doing because I like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6699)|
| 1:51:43| Let's pick that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6703)|
| 1:51:44| We looked at the situation here and said, let's come up with some sort of general frameworks that go from kind of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6704)|
| 1:51:51| end of the spectrum to this end of the spectrum, present them, let people consider them, and then flush them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6711)|
| 1:51:58| And then if one of those seems to feel good, we can, you know, put some more meat on the bones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6718)|
| 1:52:04| And if you guys look at it and say, well, hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6724)|
| 1:52:07| we'd really like one that accomplishes this objective because we don't think we're accomplishing this objective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6727)|
| 1:52:12| But we, you know, I think we kind of covered the gambit in terms of, you know, where could you end up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6732)|
| 1:52:19| and, you know, what are the objectives of the pension system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6739)|
| 1:52:23| Those are what we tried to take into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6743)|
| 1:52:26| Yeah, I mean, I just think it's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6746)|
| 1:52:29| Eventually we're going to be proposing this to the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6749)|
| 1:52:32| So, I mean, I think that's one consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6752)|
| 1:52:36| You know, what is your average taxpayer getting at their employment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6756)|
| 1:52:39| I mean, I think that should be part of the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6759)|
| 1:52:42| Real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6762)|
| 1:52:43| Yeah, and going back to what Alan said, we looked at risk allocation between city and employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6763)|
| 1:52:49| We looked at either the retirement age or the richness of the benefit aspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6769)|
| 1:52:54| And what was the third one you mentioned at least?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6774)|
| 1:52:57| Well, when we initially had the discussion, it was the risk allocation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6777)|
| 1:53:02| but it was also the total risk in terms of how the assets are invested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6782)|
| 1:53:08| Whether we go conservative like a pile of bonds or whether we go heavily into the stock market?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6788)|
| 1:53:13| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6793)|
| 1:53:14| That's the idea, just what can we afford to take as a risk in the investment process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6794)|
| 1:53:18| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6798)|
| 1:53:19| Where are we now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6799)|
| 1:53:20| Are we in the middle or where would you say we are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6800)|
| 1:53:22| You know, if this is the end on what's reasonable in terms of equity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6802)|
| 1:53:26| and this is the end on what's reasonable in terms of fixed income,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6806)|
| 1:53:29| we're clearly on this side of the spectrum right now where we have more equity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6809)|
| 1:53:34| In other words, if somebody said, let's put another 15 percent equity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6814)|
| 1:53:37| I don't think anybody would look at that and think that would be a reasonable thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6817)|
| 1:53:41| Did you buy Apple at $60?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6821)|
| 1:53:42| That would be a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6822)|
| 1:53:44| Sorry, I missed that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6824)|
| 1:53:45| I guess my final question is, and where I'm coming from, is that we have a plan that we're committed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6825)|
| 1:53:56| And I guess the question I have for the administration is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6836)|
| 1:54:00| how do we balance going forward what it is the commitment that we make to the employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6840)|
| 1:54:07| not only the ones that we have but the ones that we're going to hire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6847)|
| 1:54:10| and at the same time we make a commitment to our taxpayers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6850)|
| 1:54:14| because there's only going to be so much money in the pot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6854)|
| 1:54:17| And so how are we going to continue to honor the obligations that we have to the taxpayers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6857)|
| 1:54:23| as well as honor the obligations that we have to the employees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6863)|
| 1:54:27| And I'm not looking for an answer for that, but that's where I'm coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6867)|
| 1:54:31| I mean, we have our taxpayers on one side that are footing the bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6871)|
| 1:54:36| And I guess that's what you refer to the risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6876)|
| 1:54:39| It's really when we say the city, we're talking about the taxpayers that are at risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6879)|
| 1:54:42| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6882)|
| 1:54:43| So that's what it boils down to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6883)|
| 1:54:45| We have the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6885)|
| 1:54:47| We have the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6887)|
| 1:54:48| We have a program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6888)|
| 1:54:49| And where are we going to give?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6889)|
| 1:54:50| Are we going to raise taxes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6890)|
| 1:54:51| Are we going to cut services?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6891)|
| 1:54:53| You know, where are we headed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6893)|
| 1:54:55| Apparently, where we are right now is we owe a whole lot of money to make up for what it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6895)|
| 1:55:00| that we've already committed to, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6900)|
| 1:55:02| And it looks like in the next couple of years we're going to have a big chunk of money that we, as taxpayers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6902)|
| 1:55:07| are going to have to pay for the commitments we've made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6907)|
| 1:55:10| So what the question is, and I guess it goes back to Councilman Della Vopi,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6910)|
| 1:55:14| is where do we come up with the $20 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6914)|
| 1:55:18| Well, they have to help us, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6918)|
| 1:55:21| So I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6921)|
| 1:55:22| I'm not asking for an answer to that, Bill, but you sort of looked like you were going to say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6922)|
| 1:55:27| I was going to say, we do have to figure out how to pay what the existing obligations are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6927)|
| 1:55:32| That's the short and medium-term challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6932)|
| 1:55:34| But we have an immediate long-term challenge of changing the plan going out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6934)|
| 1:55:38| And that's why I think, as Mayor O'Hara said at the beginning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6938)|
| 1:55:40| if we can really keep concentrated on that first, we have a deadline for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6940)|
| 1:55:48| So our next meeting is going to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6948)|
| 1:55:51| we're going to hear from the employee groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6951)|
| 1:55:55| Is everybody comfortable with still moving forward as we plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6955)|
| 1:55:59| Is that Thursday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6959)|
| 1:56:01| Not this Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6961)|
| 1:56:02| Thursday week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6962)|
| 1:56:03| I think it's the 19th, if I'm not mistaken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6963)|
| 1:56:07| And so are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6967)|
| 1:56:10| What time is that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6970)|
| 1:56:12| 530.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6972)|
| 1:56:13| The rest of them will all be at 530.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6973)|
| 1:56:14| The last one will be in the small assembly room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6974)|
| 1:56:17| I believe it's the 23rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6977)|
| 1:56:20| Whatever we posted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6980)|
| 1:56:24| Well, that will be at the, however you all want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6984)|
| 1:56:28| You know, I'll get in here, whoever you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6988)|
| 1:56:32| You know, all I did was present an outline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6992)|
| 1:56:34| And then, you know, I knew it would evolve as we got into the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6994)|
| 1:56:39| So it's very flexible, and you all just give me guidance on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=6999)|
| 1:56:43| I guess back to your all's point about comparing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=7003)|
| 1:56:46| Do you want to compare?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=7006)|
| 1:56:47| I mean, you've got University of Tennessee right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=7007)|
| 1:56:49| Do you want to look at their program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=7009)|
| 1:56:50| Do you want to look at, would that be a benefit to us to look at those programs and compare?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=7010)|
| 1:56:56| You talk about, they're talking about competition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=7016)|
| 1:56:58| I can tell you what we're, you know, the private sector, several of us can speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=7018)|
| 1:57:02| But do you want to look at that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=7022)|
| 1:57:04| And would that help us any to really compare what UT is doing or what the state is doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=7024)|
| 1:57:11| Wouldn't UT fall under the state?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=7031)|
| 1:57:13| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=7033)|
| 1:57:14| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=7034)|
| 1:57:15| I feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=7035)|
| 1:57:16| UT has two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=7036)|
| 1:57:17| They have one for faculty, which is basically defined contribution, TIE-CREF, because that's what I'm on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=7037)|
| 1:57:22| And then they also have one for the general state employees, which is an entire different defined benefit program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=7042)|
| 1:57:29| But aren't municipalities and counties throughout the state under a state?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=7049)|
| 1:57:34| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=7054)|
| 1:57:35| None of the big four cities are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=7055)|
| 1:57:37| But up to a point, there is participation in a state program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=7057)|
| 1:57:41| What are they doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=7061)|
| 1:57:42| Does that help us any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=7062)|
| 1:57:43| I don't know if it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=7063)|
| 1:57:44| I mean, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=7064)|
| 1:57:45| Well, it gives you comparisons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=7065)|
| 1:57:50| Well, the reason I mentioned KUB is that they went through the very same process that we're going through right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=7070)|
| 1:57:58| And what I thought was interesting is we can hear about the program, how it developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=7078)|
| 1:58:03| and what the employees did and how they reacted in this sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=7083)|
| 1:58:08| That's, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=7088)|
| 1:58:09| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=7089)|
| 1:58:10| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=7090)|
| 1:58:11| I mean, it sounds interesting to me if she can, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=7091)|
| 1:58:13| I mean, I'd be in favor of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=7093)|
| 1:58:26| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=7106)|
| 1:58:27| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=7107)|
| 1:58:29| Keep in mind also, and Melissa has a copy of this article that Joe Sullivan wrote concerning municipalities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=7109)|
| 1:58:35| that are involved with the TCRS, Tennessee Consolidated Retirement System.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=7115)|
| 1:58:40| I don't know if that's an option for us or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=7120)|
| 1:58:43| I don't have a clue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=7123)|
| 1:58:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=7125)|
| 1:58:46| Well, and I would urge you to call either the council office or Attorney Frost and let them know your wishes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=7126)|
| 1:58:55| But let's do it, you know, let's be as quick as we can about it to get people, you know, on our schedule, if we may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=7135)|
| 1:59:02| And any other business to come before us this evening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=7142)|
| 1:59:08| Thank you so much for your in-depth answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=7148)|
| 1:59:12| It's very, very beneficial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=7152)|
| 1:59:15| Bill, is there any closing statement that the administration would like to make?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=7155)|
| 1:59:19| We just look forward to working with you on this and being as supportive as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=7159)|
| 1:59:22| This is obviously a very, very challenging situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=7162)|
| 1:59:25| And we have to have two meetings, two public meetings in May to actually adopt something that will go to the pension board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=7165)|
| 1:59:33| to consider before it gets to the ballot, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=7173)|
| 1:59:39| Two separate meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=7179)|
| 1:59:48| Are we adjourned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=7188)|
| 1:59:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=7190)|
| 1:59:51| We stand adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=7191)|
| 1:59:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=7192)|
| 2:00:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120409pension?start=7203)|
