| 2:32:53| Otherwise, we have undesirables, and that's the reason the gate is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=9173)|
| 2:32:57| So you don't think the gate is actually on the city street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=9177)|
| 2:33:01| My understanding is that that has always been private property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=9181)|
| 2:33:05| The church came to Victor Ashe after the telecommunication tower was erected up there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=9185)|
| 2:33:12| and they thought that they could do a lot of things if they were in the city that they couldn't do in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=9192)|
| 2:33:17| So, therefore, they became part of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=9197)|
| 2:33:20| After they got in there, they found out the things they wanted to do they were not able to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=9200)|
| 2:33:24| such as signage and lighting and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=9204)|
| 2:33:27| So at that time, that road was never designated as a regular road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=9207)|
| 2:33:34| It was more of a service road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=9214)|
| 2:33:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=9216)|
| 2:33:37| Really more to the point, I think, of what we have before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=9217)|
| 2:33:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=9219)|
| 2:33:43| Will that being a public street and the proposal, and that's not included in your motion, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=9223)|
| 2:33:48| but the proposal, as Mr. Seymour stated, to pursue the closure of that right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=9228)|
| 2:33:54| will any of this agreement be contingent on that closure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=9234)|
| 2:33:59| No, and I do not believe that is one of the primary concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=9239)|
| 2:34:03| I think that is just a concern regarding the property owner's needs there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=9243)|
| 2:34:10| And I think it's something that both parties really desire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=9250)|
| 2:34:13| Am I correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=9253)|
| 2:34:15| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=9255)|
| 2:34:16| I'm just concerned that I want to make sure we don't pass something that's contingent on another action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=9256)|
| 2:34:20| this council hasn't taken yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=9260)|
| 2:34:21| No, I think that is just simply specifying one of the points that concerns both property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=9261)|
| 2:34:26| But when I did my first walk through and with the developers actually asking me to come out and look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=9266)|
| 2:34:33| they indicated a desire to actually have a gated, they want their property to be gated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=9273)|
| 2:34:40| So where it's located will depend on what they can work out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=9280)|
| 2:34:43| And I think that will satisfy both parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=9283)|
| 2:34:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=9288)|
| 2:34:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=9289)|
| 2:34:51| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=9291)|
| 2:34:52| Is Steve Bethel here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=9292)|

| 2:35:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=9301)|
| 2:35:02| Ms. Pila, do you have anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=9302)|
| 2:35:04| Ms. Pila, do you have anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=9304)|
| 2:35:05| Are you okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=9305)|
| 2:35:06| No, I'm okay for the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=9306)|
| 2:35:09| I think that is the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=9309)|
| 2:35:10| Seeing none, we're ready to vote on the amendment at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=9310)|

| 2:35:41| Yes, and this is for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=9341)|
| 2:35:43| But Mr. Councilman Becker did ask about, or Councilman Bailey, I guess it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=9343)|
| 2:35:48| ask about the developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=9348)|

| 2:35:53| introduce yourselves, if that's all right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=9353)|

| 2:37:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=9440)|
| 2:37:21| I make a motion that Section 1 of the proposed ordinance be amended as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=9441)|
| 2:37:26| The zoning ordinance of the City of Knoxville being Ordinance Number 3369 be and is the same hereby be amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=9446)|
| 2:37:35| And I think, Mr. Seymour, you have some words out of order here, so this may not make great sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=9455)|
| 2:37:41| But, anyway, I didn't have an opportunity to speak to you about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=9461)|
| 2:37:44| I was doing the typing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=9464)|
| 2:37:46| Yeah, well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=9466)|
| 2:37:47| We'll deduct 25 percent from that legal bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=9467)|
| 2:37:49| We definitely understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=9469)|
| 2:37:50| So if the recorder thinks there might be a problem here, I think she's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=9470)|
| 2:37:56| But that it hereby be amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070814?start=9476)|
