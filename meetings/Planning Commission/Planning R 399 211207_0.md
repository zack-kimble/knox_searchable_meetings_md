| 0:00:30| Good morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=30)|
| 0:00:32| Welcome to the December agenda review meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=32)|
| 0:00:36| We have a number of commissioners that are still not live yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=36)|
| 0:01:05| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=65)|
| 0:01:30| Is this one working?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=90)|
| 0:01:31| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=91)|
| 0:01:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=99)|
| 0:01:40| Thank you, Kevin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=100)|
| 0:01:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=102)|
| 0:01:43| I just have a few announcements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=103)|
| 0:01:50| So as you all know, Knox County's comprehensive land use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=110)|
| 0:01:53| transportation plan has been approved by county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=113)|
| 0:01:58| It's currently underway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=118)|
| 0:02:00| We have our planning's web and graphic design team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=120)|
| 0:02:07| along with Knox County's communication team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=127)|
| 0:02:09| met with the consultants to discuss branding for the project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=129)|
| 0:02:13| as well as website design before the holiday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=133)|
| 0:02:16| But for now, I'll send out this URL to all of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=136)|
| 0:02:21| but before we get the websites stood up and the new brand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=141)|
| 0:02:26| we have web content related to the plan that's available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=146)|
| 0:02:29| at knoxplanning.org slash comprehensive dash plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=149)|
| 0:02:37| Our research staff, Aubrey and Dr. Terry Gahula,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=157)|
| 0:02:41| have been assisting Knox County's administrator of elections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=161)|
| 0:02:44| and election commission to make adjustments to voting precinct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=164)|
| 0:02:47| boundaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=167)|
| 0:02:49| With the release of the 2020 census data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=169)|
| 0:02:52| the administrator identified several precincts that grew in size beyond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=172)|
| 0:02:55| the state mandated limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=175)|
| 0:02:58| Since the last decennial census in 2010,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=178)|
| 0:03:02| which is a common occurrence every 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=182)|
| 0:03:05| So precincts should have no more than 6,000 registered voters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=185)|
| 0:03:09| if at all practical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=189)|
| 0:03:11| Knox County has identified several that exceed that number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=191)|
| 0:03:14| and they'll need to be split.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=194)|
| 0:03:15| So our staff is providing some GIS mapping assistance to them to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=195)|
| 0:03:20| them identify appropriate new boundaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=200)|
| 0:03:24| We will have a staff member, Debbie Mitchell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=204)|
| 0:03:27| She's currently, you all, most of you probably never met her,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=207)|
| 0:03:30| but she has been with us for 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=210)|
| 0:03:33| She's one of our administrative assistants and specifically helps out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=213)|
| 0:03:37| with our library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=217)|
| 0:03:39| And she is retiring after nearly 30 years of service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=219)|
| 0:03:45| and her last day will be on the 16th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=225)|
| 0:03:47| So she's really one of a handful of staff members that we have left that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=227)|
| 0:03:50| have 20 years plus experience with the agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=230)|
| 0:03:54| So we're really sad to see her go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=234)|
| 0:03:56| but we're happy for her and her new chapter ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=236)|
| 0:04:00| And that's all I have today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=240)|
| 0:04:04| I'll go ahead and get us started with agenda item number 31,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=244)|
| 0:04:08| which is 10A21OA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=248)|
| 0:04:10| This is an ordinance amendment that was initiated by the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=250)|
| 0:04:16| So this item is consideration of adding airport as a special use in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=256)|
| 0:04:21| institutional zoning district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=261)|
| 0:04:24| Most of you are probably familiar with the Knoxville Downtown Island Home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=264)|
| 0:04:26| Airport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=266)|
| 0:04:27| It's one of two airports operated by the Metropolitan Knoxville Airport| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=267)|
| 0:04:30| Authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=270)|
| 0:04:32| I think Mike's bringing it up here on the screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=272)|
| 0:04:34| It's just not very far from here, just a little over two miles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=274)|
| 0:04:38| It's a general aviation facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=278)|
| 0:04:40| and it's a base for private and corporate aircraft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=280)|
| 0:04:43| The airport was established in 1930 and became a public facility in 1963.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=283)|
| 0:04:48| Currently in the city's zoning code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=288)|
| 0:04:50| airports are permitted only in the IH heavy industrial zoning district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=290)|
| 0:04:55| The Downtown Island Airport is zoned institutional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=295)|
| 0:04:58| This airport did exist legally upon the effective date of the city code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=298)|
| 0:05:02| and is allowed to continue to exist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=302)|
| 0:05:04| but it is subject to part of the code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=304)|
| 0:05:06| Article 17.1 that relates to nonconforming building structures and uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=306)|
| 0:05:10| of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=310)|
| 0:05:12| The challenge is that the property's current status is legal nonconforming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=312)|
| 0:05:16| use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=316)|
| 0:05:17| and it requires that the airport authority request variances from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=317)|
| 0:05:19| Board of Zoning Appeals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=319)|
| 0:05:21| pretty much for anything they want to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=321)|
| 0:05:23| to alter any of the existing structures or to add additional structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=323)|
| 0:05:27| So although they're legal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=327)|
| 0:05:29| the nonconforming status of the airport use in the institutional zone does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=329)|
| 0:05:32| not meet the requirements of the Federal Aviation Administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=332)|
| 0:05:35| which long-term can create challenges for the airport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=335)|
| 0:05:38| So this ordinance amendment is to add airport as a special use in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=338)|
| 0:05:46| institutional district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=346)|
| 0:05:48| so that will allow them to submit a plan if they do have any future plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=348)|
| 0:05:52| for expansion or just even modifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=352)|
| 0:05:55| Obviously the airport's been there for a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=355)|
| 0:05:57| so there will be need from time to time to do maintenance and upgrades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=357)|
| 0:06:00| And so that would come before the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=360)|
| 0:06:05| I'm curious, why didn't we just rezone it back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=365)|
| 0:06:08| Why didn't we rezone it back to where an airport?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=368)|
| 0:06:11| To heavy industrial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=371)|
| 0:06:14| I think the thought was that heavy industrial wasn't a good zone for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=374)|
| 0:06:20| particular piece of property there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=380)|
| 0:06:22| It is a floodplain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=382)|
| 0:06:26| I mean, there's some challenges with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=386)|
| 0:06:28| Additionally, there had been discussions early on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=388)|
| 0:06:30| and I wasn't part of all those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=390)|
| 0:06:32| but Director Green was in talking to the airport about having an airport| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=392)|
| 0:06:37| overlay zone, and that just hasn't moved forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=397)|
| 0:06:40| So I think long-term that might be something that gets discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=400)|
| 0:06:43| A lot of other communities have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=403)|
| 0:06:47| Yeah, I'd definitely like doing it your way other than doing the industrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=407)|
| 0:06:52| because you're going through Island Home, and if that airport ever stopped,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=412)|
| 0:06:55| I mean, you wouldn't want heavy, intense uses going through Island Home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=415)|
| 0:07:00| So whether it's an overlay or the route you're going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=420)|
| 0:07:06| I think that's a more appropriate way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=426)|
| 0:07:09| Does this mean we can have airports in other institutional areas, though?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=429)|
| 0:07:13| Yeah, or do you do a planned development and a special use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=433)|
| 0:07:19| Somebody could propose one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=439)|
| 0:07:22| But we could say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=442)|
| 0:07:23| Yeah, and it has to be a public airport, too, so it can't be a private facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=443)|
| 0:07:26| So I think that does limit the interest in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=446)|
| 0:07:29| And, Commissioner, we did discuss planned development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=449)|
| 0:07:33| I think that they weren't interested in necessarily pursuing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=453)|
| 0:07:44| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=464)|
| 0:07:54| Item number 32, 12A.21.0A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=474)|
| 0:07:58| This item is consideration of adding drug treatment clinics to three zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=478)|
| 0:08:03| in the city's zoning code as a permitted use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=483)|
| 0:08:05| as well as some minor amendments to the principal use standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=485)|
| 0:08:08| for drug treatment centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=488)|
| 0:08:10| A drug treatment center clinic is defined in the code as a facility licensed by the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=490)|
| 0:08:14| to administer drugs that is not but limited to methadone or suboxone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=494)|
| 0:08:19| in the treatment, maintenance, and or detoxification of persons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=499)|
| 0:08:24| These clinics are currently permitted in the institutional zoning district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=504)|
| 0:08:26| and allowed as a special use in the CH zoning district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=506)|
| 0:08:30| Those of you who attended the Planning Commission retreat heard of the need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=510)|
| 0:08:34| our community has for these types of facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=514)|
| 0:08:37| And staff is recommending that adding these drug treatment clinics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=517)|
| 0:08:41| to three commercial districts as a permitted use does allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=521)|
| 0:08:47| for additional consideration of where these can be located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=527)|
| 0:08:51| I have a map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=531)|
| 0:08:52| I'm happy to send it around if you all want to look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=532)|
| 0:08:55| where they're currently allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=535)|
| 0:08:57| You'll see a lot of the deep dark purple around downtown is really UT's facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=537)|
| 0:09:03| So I would, in terms of looking at this, I would take that out of consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=543)|
| 0:09:09| in terms of these types of facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=549)|
| 0:09:15| One of the reasons that these three zones were identified was that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=555)|
| 0:09:19| these are areas in our community that are more accessible to transit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=559)|
| 0:09:22| as well as other commercial uses, which really does attempt to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=562)|
| 0:09:27| remove the barriers to this type of care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=567)|
| 0:09:31| Additionally, the medical professionals that serve drug treatment centers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=571)|
| 0:09:34| and drugs they administer are highly regulated by the state and federal authorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=574)|
| 0:09:38| And this level of oversight, coupled with our principal use standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=578)|
| 0:09:42| we believe would address any potential adverse impacts associated with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=582)|
| 0:09:45| adding this use to the additional zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=585)|
| 0:09:51| Do we have any specific questions about this ordinance amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=591)|
| 0:09:54| I do, Director Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=594)|
| 0:09:56| Did you all have any public comment sessions regarding this change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=596)|
| 0:10:00| to the zoning ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=600)|
| 0:10:02| We have not received any public comment on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=602)|
| 0:10:04| It's been posted for about a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=604)|
| 0:10:06| Has there been any sessions or reaching out to neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=606)|
| 0:10:09| or anyone specific about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=609)|
| 0:10:12| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=612)|
| 0:10:13| And was there any consideration given to a special use, especially the CG,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=613)|
| 0:10:18| since so much of that CG can border neighborhoods and more small businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=618)|
| 0:10:24| than the other two zones that are being proposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=624)|
| 0:10:28| Again, it goes back to how highly regulated this type of use is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=628)|
| 0:10:32| by the state and the federal government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=632)|
| 0:10:38| I don't know what other, in terms of what else we would add on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=638)|
| 0:10:44| as part of the special use process that would be a benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=644)|
| 0:10:49| Because there's already distance requirements, if you'll look in the memo itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=649)|
| 0:10:57| You actually limited the distance requirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=657)|
| 0:10:59| and then you took out some of the other uses that were going to be adjacent to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=659)|
| 0:11:11| So we aligned it with the drug-free zones are 500 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=671)|
| 0:11:19| and that was changed in 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=679)|
| 0:11:21| So we aligned it with that to be consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=681)|
| 0:11:24| Additionally, taking out the park, place of worship, residential dwelling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=684)|
| 0:11:29| or pharmacy or similar facilitated sales or dispenses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=689)|
| 0:11:32| either prescription drugs or over-the-counter drugs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=692)|
| 0:11:34| that was struck from the principal use standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=694)|
| 0:11:38| And that's for this vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=698)|
| 0:11:40| Correct, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=700)|
| 0:11:42| And then what about the last?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=702)|
| 0:11:44| I didn't pull up the zoning code, but there was another criteria,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=704)|
| 0:11:53| it was the last one listed that was taken out where you looked at any adjacent property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=713)|
| 0:12:00| and determined whether it was going to be impactful to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=720)|
| 0:12:06| Are you referring to the F in reviewing each application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=726)|
| 0:12:09| the Knox-Lenox County Planning Commission may establish additional requirements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=729)|
| 0:12:12| That's specific to the special use, a special use review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=732)|
| 0:12:16| No, I'm looking at...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=736)|
| 0:12:20| And that's typical of how we would look at any special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=740)|
| 0:12:23| We would look at the surrounding properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=743)|
| 0:12:27| and assess the type of use and what would be the potential impacts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=747)|
| 0:12:36| I'm looking at the F in reviewing each application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=756)|
| 0:12:40| Is that what you just said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=760)|
| 0:12:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=761)|
| 0:12:42| So that's going to be taken out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=762)|
| 0:12:44| That's specific to the special use process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=764)|
| 0:12:47| So when you're reviewing, it's very common when you're reviewing a special use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=767)|
| 0:12:51| this is what you would look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=771)|
| 0:12:54| the impact that the type of facility might have on surrounding properties or the use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=774)|
| 0:12:59| So this isn't going to be a special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=779)|
| 0:13:02| This is going to be permitted by right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=782)|
| 0:13:04| Why are you updating the special use criteria?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=784)|
| 0:13:07| Because it's specific to the Knox-Lenox County Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=787)|
| 0:13:12| and we don't review permits for these types of facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=792)|
| 0:13:15| We wouldn't review a building permit or any kind of...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=795)|
| 0:13:18| They would just go directly to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=798)|
| 0:13:20| So it wouldn't be kicked back to us or the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=800)|
| 0:13:27| Amy, was there any consideration of making this instead of a permitted use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=807)|
| 0:13:31| a use on review?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=811)|
| 0:13:32| Yes, that's what Commissioner Midas was just asking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=812)|
| 0:13:36| Yes, if that's something that you all feel that it should come back to you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=816)|
| 0:13:41| to review each one of these as a special use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=821)|
| 0:13:43| that is something that can be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=823)|
| 0:13:45| I know she was talking about special uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=825)|
| 0:13:48| I guess there's no difference between a special use and a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=828)|
| 0:13:51| Yes, so the use on review is the terminology used in the Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=831)|
| 0:13:54| In the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=834)|
| 0:13:55| And the special use is the city, but they're essentially the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=835)|
| 0:13:59| Why would we consider special use for this use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=839)|
| 0:14:04| and not for emergency clinics in these same zones?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=844)|
| 0:14:11| Yes, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=851)|
| 0:14:12| I don't disagree with you there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=852)|
| 0:14:14| I was just...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=854)|
| 0:14:15| You know, we're going to get a lot of...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=855)|
| 0:14:16| We're treating...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=856)|
| 0:14:17| Every time we look at a drug treatment facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=857)|
| 0:14:21| we get a whole bunch of flack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=861)|
| 0:14:24| You're going to get opposition from the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=864)|
| 0:14:27| You are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=867)|
| 0:14:28| They're also where it goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=868)|
| 0:14:29| But unless you have specific criteria that you want to apply to these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=869)|
| 0:14:33| rather than just being arbitrary and capricious,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=873)|
| 0:14:35| we've got to have some specific criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=875)|
| 0:14:38| And I see now, I'm thinking what you're saying makes sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=878)|
| 0:14:41| because then we're not sitting here listening to everybody argue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=881)|
| 0:14:44| I don't want it in my back door if it's permitted use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=884)|
| 0:14:47| Well, I guess my trickle-down question of TIMS would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=887)|
| 0:14:50| we're talking about doing it in the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=890)|
| 0:14:52| and a lot of the ones that I remember us having a lot of discussion on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=892)|
| 0:14:56| have been in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=896)|
| 0:14:57| That one on Ball Road, I think, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=897)|
| 0:14:59| was one that we got down in the weeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=899)|
| 0:15:01| And I think maybe Asheville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=901)|
| 0:15:04| Well, that's based on perception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=904)|
| 0:15:06| People have a perception of what these things are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=906)|
| 0:15:08| No, I get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=908)|
| 0:15:09| And what I understand is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=909)|
| 0:15:10| So my question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=910)|
| 0:15:11| why are we just doing this for the city and not doing it for the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=911)|
| 0:15:15| and the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=915)|
| 0:15:16| It's just my natural question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=916)|
| 0:15:18| And it's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=918)|
| 0:15:19| It's that the city, we were asked specifically to take a look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=919)|
| 0:15:23| With the new code going into effect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=923)|
| 0:15:26| this has been comment of, hey, did we consider all the districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=926)|
| 0:15:33| like this type that you should be considered in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=933)|
| 0:15:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=936)|
| 0:15:38| So you're likely to get a different answer at county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=938)|
| 0:15:43| But I think that it would be appropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=943)|
| 0:15:47| as we're going through this thought process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=947)|
| 0:15:50| if one thinks that there's a lot of merit to that to do it in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=950)|
| 0:15:54| I think that might be something that you want to ask county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=954)|
| 0:15:58| about in a public comment session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=958)|
| 0:16:01| or as you talk to them about monthly business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=961)|
| 0:16:05| That might be something that you want to make them aware of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=965)|
| 0:16:07| that you're doing in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=967)|
| 0:16:09| Do they have an interest in doing it in the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=969)|
| 0:16:11| Is that an appropriate question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=971)|
| 0:16:14| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=974)|
| 0:16:15| I mean, do you all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=975)|
| 0:16:17| I certainly would love to see it expanded to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=977)|
| 0:16:21| But I think there was a lot of emphasis on the bus line, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=981)|
| 0:16:25| making it accessible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=985)|
| 0:16:27| Because most people suffering these illnesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=987)|
| 0:16:30| often the first thing they lose is transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=990)|
| 0:16:33| Well, the reason I'm saying that is I do want to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=993)|
| 0:16:36| that we're consistent, that somebody's going to come up and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=996)|
| 0:16:40| well, why did you let them do it in the city and not the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1000)|
| 0:16:43| So I at least want to have that discussion to continue that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1003)|
| 0:16:47| Because that would be a valid point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1007)|
| 0:16:49| is that there's no bus availability, transportation availability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1009)|
| 0:16:53| But there's nothing that prevents this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1013)|
| 0:16:56| from submitting a proposal to the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1016)|
| 0:16:59| That can be done any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1019)|
| 0:17:01| We don't have to be requested to amend an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1021)|
| 0:17:07| No, you all can also request staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1027)|
| 0:17:09| to take something into consideration as a body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1029)|
| 0:17:11| and we can add it to our work program if you want us to consider adding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1031)|
| 0:17:14| I mean, we'd have to look at the definitions in the county code, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1034)|
| 0:17:18| It's just a totally different code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1038)|
| 0:17:20| But consideration of adding drug treatment clinics to the county code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1040)|
| 0:17:23| that's something that we could explore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1043)|
| 0:17:27| Can I go back to something Commissioner Phillips said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1047)|
| 0:17:30| about having very specific requirements around this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1050)|
| 0:17:34| Because if I'm understanding correctly, this does not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1054)|
| 0:17:40| This proposal is just permitted use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1060)|
| 0:17:44| But you were saying it'd be great if we had permitted use with the specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1064)|
| 0:17:50| No, I think in response to Jeff's comment or Amy's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1070)|
| 0:17:55| that if we look at doing it as a use on review or a special exception,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1075)|
| 0:17:59| I forget the exact terminology,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1079)|
| 0:18:01| you know, we know we're going to get opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1081)|
| 0:18:03| It's just a given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1083)|
| 0:18:05| So in order, we don't want to be arbitrary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1085)|
| 0:18:07| So my thought was if that was needed, which I'm not sure it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1087)|
| 0:18:11| then to have specific standards, then we need to have them itemized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1091)|
| 0:18:15| Because otherwise we start getting into discussions back and forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1095)|
| 0:18:20| with the public over, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1100)|
| 0:18:22| appropriateness of this type of facility in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1102)|
| 0:18:25| It gets arbitrary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1105)|
| 0:18:27| So I think being as controversial as they are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1107)|
| 0:18:30| we need to have more specific requirements outlined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1110)|
| 0:18:33| if we go in that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1113)|
| 0:18:35| But I'm not saying it's worth going that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1115)|
| 0:18:37| Understood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1117)|
| 0:18:38| Thank you for clarifying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1118)|
| 0:18:39| Let's not lose sight that this is tightly regulated by the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1119)|
| 0:18:43| I think that's where we land with a defense, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1123)|
| 0:18:49| And I'd like to, can I clarify real quick about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1129)|
| 0:18:52| what's in our standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1132)|
| 0:18:55| So, you know, as Commissioner Hill just said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1135)|
| 0:18:57| this is a tightly regulated industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1137)|
| 0:19:00| So the approval of a drug treatment clinic is contingent upon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1140)|
| 0:19:05| receipt of an appropriate license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1145)|
| 0:19:07| This is all part of the Tennessee Department of Mental Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1147)|
| 0:19:09| and Substance Abuse Services process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1149)|
| 0:19:11| They have to go through licensure as well as a certificate of need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1151)|
| 0:19:14| process to prove there is a need for additional treatment facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1154)|
| 0:19:17| in a geographic area in which they plan to locate a clinic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1157)|
| 0:19:22| And they also have to adhere to the 500 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1162)|
| 0:19:26| the drug-free zones adjacent to schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1166)|
| 0:19:29| So, you know, my question to you all would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1169)|
| 0:19:32| what additional standards would need to be applied above| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1172)|
| 0:19:37| and beyond what's already required by the state?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1177)|
| 0:19:39| And I would challenge us that it needs to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1179)|
| 0:19:42| if we want it to go through a special use process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1182)|
| 0:19:44| we need to be very specific and very clear so we can evaluate these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1184)|
| 0:19:47| all fairly and consistently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1187)|
| 0:19:49| I'm not advocating for the special use route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1189)|
| 0:19:52| I wanted to understand what Commissioner Phillips was saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1192)|
| 0:19:56| And, Commissioner Hill, I think the thing I'm blurring is there was a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1196)|
| 0:20:02| case a while back that there was a faith-based approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1202)|
| 0:20:10| This is the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1210)|
| 0:20:12| Completely different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1212)|
| 0:20:13| It's completely different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1213)|
| 0:20:14| This is medication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1214)|
| 0:20:15| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1215)|
| 0:20:16| That's what I was worried that there was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1216)|
| 0:20:19| Yeah, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1219)|
| 0:20:20| Is there a differentiation between is this an overnight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1220)|
| 0:20:25| or just a treatment clinic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1225)|
| 0:20:29| Or is this someplace that people would go and stay for days at a time to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1229)|
| 0:20:33| dry out or to be administered to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1233)|
| 0:20:37| Or is there any reason to even differentiate those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1237)|
| 0:20:43| It could be any of all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1243)|
| 0:20:45| No, I don't believe that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1245)|
| 0:20:46| They are not overnight facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1246)|
| 0:20:49| This is not an overnight facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1249)|
| 0:20:52| So, basically, what I understood from what you just said is it's like a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1252)|
| 0:20:55| hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1255)|
| 0:20:56| They have to have a certificate of need basically approved by the state?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1256)|
| 0:20:58| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1258)|
| 0:21:00| And, additionally, there is a location requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1260)|
| 0:21:03| So they do have to be on Arterial Street as shown on our city major road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1263)|
| 0:21:06| plan as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1266)|
| 0:21:09| One of my concerns is that the bus line or the public transit being a main| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1269)|
| 0:21:19| requirement really does start to be a self-fulfilling prophecy for how all of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1279)|
| 0:21:25| these facilities are in these specific places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1285)|
| 0:21:29| So I don't know how to detangle that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1289)|
| 0:21:32| Like, I understand the reason it's there for what someone was saying about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1292)|
| 0:21:36| persons losing their ability to drive and needing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1296)|
| 0:21:40| But I don't feel like it should be a requirement because that starts to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1300)|
| 0:21:47| like I said, just builds this expectation that if you're on a bus line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1307)|
| 0:21:50| that's a bad thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1310)|
| 0:21:52| And being on a bus line is a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1312)|
| 0:21:55| There's not a requirement specifically in here that it has to be on a bus line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1315)|
| 0:21:59| The location requirement is, of course, the 500 feet that I mentioned and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1319)|
| 0:22:03| the access to an Arterial Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1323)|
| 0:22:08| It's one that, so when we're, I think maybe it's come up because in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1328)|
| 0:22:11| county, when we talked about these in the past or similar type facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1331)|
| 0:22:15| that's been one of the things that staff and this commission have looked at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1335)|
| 0:22:20| is there access to a bus line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1340)|
| 0:22:24| What can we do to the body to encourage the county to take on a similar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1344)|
| 0:22:31| approach so there's some consistency and it's not only available in the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1351)|
| 0:22:38| I think the commission, if they so devoted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1358)|
| 0:22:40| could direct the staff to prepare an ordinance or a resolution to the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1360)|
| 0:22:46| in a similar fashion, same as the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1366)|
| 0:22:51| I'd be in favor of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1371)|
| 0:22:53| Does it have to be a public vote or a motion of some kind?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1373)|
| 0:22:55| Well, there has to be a motion and it has to be approved by the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1375)|
| 0:23:00| Would it have to be on the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1380)|
| 0:23:03| It wouldn't necessarily have to be on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1383)|
| 0:23:05| I don't, it's not clear in your bylaws or your administrative rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1385)|
| 0:23:09| I think if you all wanted us to put it on to our work program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1389)|
| 0:23:11| we could put it on our work program and then you all would vote on the work program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1391)|
| 0:23:15| Would this be for consideration?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1395)|
| 0:23:17| No, you don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1397)|
| 0:23:18| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1398)|
| 0:23:19| But that would be a long time from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1399)|
| 0:23:24| We're getting ready to update our work program for the next upcoming year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1404)|
| 0:23:28| Didn't we just stop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1408)|
| 0:23:29| Yes, it seems like we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1409)|
| 0:23:34| Can I make one more comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1414)|
| 0:23:41| That will be many years from now, probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1421)|
| 0:23:47| Just getting back to this, I respect what Commissioner Hill and Commissioner Phillips said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1427)|
| 0:23:54| You know, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1434)|
| 0:23:55| We definitely need these type of treatment facilities all throughout the city and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1435)|
| 0:24:01| I guess my only concern is that with the city zoning ordinance just being passed less than a couple of years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1441)|
| 0:24:08| there was a lot of input that was given to that document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1448)|
| 0:24:14| And I hadn't really heard anything about this amendment until I looked at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1454)|
| 0:24:17| I don't know how many people in the city have actually heard this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1457)|
| 0:24:22| This is impactful for neighborhoods all across the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1462)|
| 0:24:26| And I guess even having some more time to make certain that neighborhoods and businesses alike know what's being proposed here before we pass it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1466)|
| 0:24:34| seems to me like it would be a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1474)|
| 0:24:37| Were you at the last attendee review?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1477)|
| 0:24:40| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1480)|
| 0:24:41| With Karen Pershing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1481)|
| 0:24:42| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1482)|
| 0:24:44| No, I was at the training workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1484)|
| 0:24:47| Oh, workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1487)|
| 0:24:48| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1488)|
| 0:24:51| I wish you had been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1491)|
| 0:24:53| I really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1493)|
| 0:24:54| I think as much as I have been involved in this effort, it still changed my way of thinking in a way that I never thought of before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1494)|
| 0:25:04| And I go back to why do we want to put tougher guidelines on treating illness, this particular illness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1504)|
| 0:25:13| as we do treating other illnesses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1513)|
| 0:25:16| And I think that I just think it's wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1516)|
| 0:25:20| I think it's morally wrong to treat this illness in a more restrictive way than any other illness that we treat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1520)|
| 0:25:26| And the fact, if you look at those statistics that they've sent out, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1526)|
| 0:25:31| we're giving shots to people with COVID out in the parking lot and we're losing more to opioids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1531)|
| 0:25:42| And the ones that we're losing are the youth, the young with more years in their lives to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1542)|
| 0:25:51| You know, many people are dying with COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1551)|
| 0:25:54| We're losing people young, I mean, a whole generation of folks to this epidemic, and it is massive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1554)|
| 0:26:02| I just hope you'll consider it tomorrow in a way that we treat other illnesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1562)|
| 0:26:07| And I don't disagree with you, Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1567)|
| 0:26:10| I just am concerned that the public should have input on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1570)|
| 0:26:14| And I'm not sure if they have been informed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1574)|
| 0:26:17| That's just my only question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1577)|
| 0:26:19| There'll be public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1579)|
| 0:26:21| It does, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1581)|
| 0:26:22| Because of city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1582)|
| 0:26:23| So all the districts in the city would get represented by the folks that lead those districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1583)|
| 0:26:29| and they would get feedback as to what their constituents are telling them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1589)|
| 0:26:36| There would be public comment there, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1596)|
| 0:26:40| When will it come before council, if we approve it tomorrow, Director Brooks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1600)|
| 0:26:47| I believe it's in January for two readings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1607)|
| 0:26:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1610)|
| 0:26:54| I think there's a public perception that these contribute to crime and degradation of the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1614)|
| 0:27:01| and statistically it just doesn't really exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1621)|
| 0:27:04| I mean, there's really no reason to treat them that much different than a medical facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1624)|
| 0:27:12| And I would argue that treatment facilities probably reduce the crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1632)|
| 0:27:15| Probably not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1635)|
| 0:27:17| Because people are getting treated as opposed to being out there doing what they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1637)|
| 0:27:24| Yeah, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1644)|
| 0:27:25| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1645)|
| 0:27:27| Other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1647)|
| 0:27:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1652)|
| 0:27:35| Item number 24, prosperity crossings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1655)|
| 0:27:40| Concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1660)|
| 0:27:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1662)|
| 0:27:43| All right, thank you, Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1663)|
| 0:27:46| Let me get to my case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1666)|
| 0:27:48| So prosperity crossing is in the northwest corner of the Watt Road interchange with I-75, I-40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1668)|
| 0:27:55| It's a project that had a couple approvals in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1675)|
| 0:27:59| and they've started doing grading in the past, so you're probably familiar with this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1679)|
| 0:28:07| Let me back up just a hair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1687)|
| 0:28:10| You did receive a revised staff report from me yesterday, I believe, for 12SD21C, the brig station report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1690)|
| 0:28:20| I had accidentally put a condition in there that didn't relate to that project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1700)|
| 0:28:24| so I removed that condition and then updated the number of conditions for approval, which is seven now instead of eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1704)|
| 0:28:30| I just wanted to make sure you knew what that change was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1710)|
| 0:28:33| It was just a corrective mistake I made on that report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1713)|
| 0:28:39| Okay, so back to the prosperity crossing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1719)|
| 0:28:42| So this is a bit of a unique situation for us, for a concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1722)|
| 0:28:50| If you look at the plan itself, it's pretty minimalistic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1730)|
| 0:28:55| It just shows a road system coming through, a couple of cross streets within the subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1735)|
| 0:29:01| but there's no lots other than existing lot lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1741)|
| 0:29:05| What they're requesting is essentially to approve the bones of the development, let's put it that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1745)|
| 0:29:15| the road system so that they can establish the road profiles, so they can create a grading plan and start doing some work on the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1755)|
| 0:29:24| They do not intend to use this approval as a means to start the development per se, like sell lots and begin construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1764)|
| 0:29:33| As a matter of fact, we have conditions in the recommending conditions in the staff report that limit what kind of activity can happen on the site after this approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1773)|
| 0:29:43| There is not a traffic impact study associated with this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1783)|
| 0:29:49| That was one of our primary concerns when they submitted the application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1789)|
| 0:29:53| making sure that all the road improvements and things that need to be done in this intersection or interchange area do get done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1793)|
| 0:30:06| Like I said, this is a bit of a unique situation, so I wanted to briefly go over the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1806)|
| 0:30:14| If you're looking at this plan, I-40 is on the left side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1814)|
| 0:30:18| This is the intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1818)|
| 0:30:20| If you're going west, you'd pull off at the Watt Road interchange here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1820)|
| 0:30:24| The Flying J is to the southeast in this directional image, north to east side in reality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1824)|
| 0:30:32| El Camino Lane is a frontage road that extends out into Loudoun County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1832)|
| 0:30:39| They would access El Camino Lane with their main road going through the middle of the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1839)|
| 0:30:48| Everett Road goes to the north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1848)|
| 0:30:51| You connect into Buttermilk and then to Hickory Creek Road if you're going up the Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1851)|
| 0:30:59| Their main spine road would connect to Everett Road just south of Buttermilk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1859)|
| 0:31:05| In the previous approvals, this is a very similar layout to previous approvals they've had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1865)|
| 0:31:12| They do have a couple roads that extend out into Loudoun County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1872)|
| 0:31:15| so they would have to get Loudoun County's approval for those portions of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1875)|
| 0:31:20| Let me show you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1880)|
| 0:31:24| This is the road profile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1884)|
| 0:31:27| If you're familiar with this Watt Road interchange, you know it's pretty much a bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1887)|
| 0:31:33| They're planning on taking a road up the ridge and back down the ridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1893)|
| 0:31:37| and they will be removing a good portion of the top of the hill as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1897)|
| 0:31:45| So this is the dark line is the new road profile coming up and then coming over the ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1905)|
| 0:31:51| The dashed line is the existing topography.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1911)|
| 0:31:54| If you see, this is actually the rest of the ridge here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1914)|
| 0:31:57| It goes off the page up top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1917)|
| 0:31:59| So it's a good amount that they're taking off the top of the hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1919)|
| 0:32:04| and I'm just going to presume that it's going to be pushed down to the north side of the ridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1924)|
| 0:32:12| so the opposite side, not the interstate side, but the opposite side of the hill to create paths and such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1932)|
| 0:32:20| But there are a few variances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1940)|
| 0:32:25| so something that you're going to start seeing on concept plans, staff reports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1945)|
| 0:32:29| are an explanation of the variances that they're requesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1949)|
| 0:32:35| I guess I'll show you what we missed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1955)|
| 0:32:39| And this might, we might modify how we do this in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1959)|
| 0:32:42| but right now this is what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1962)|
| 0:32:45| For each subdivision variance, we will list them out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1965)|
| 0:32:50| and then give some rationale for approving those variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1970)|
| 0:32:55| Just so you know, variance number three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1975)|
| 0:32:58| we're actually requesting or recommending denial of variance three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1978)|
| 0:33:02| and I'll show you what they're requesting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1982)|
| 0:33:04| but in reality we're not, we're just recommending a different reduction than what they requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1984)|
| 0:33:13| They're requesting a vertical curve variance from K of 25 to K of 19,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=1993)|
| 0:33:21| and county engineering was recommending a K of 20 instead of 19,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2001)|
| 0:33:25| which is just a very slight change to what their request is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2005)|
| 0:33:29| And that's variance number four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2009)|
| 0:33:33| So technically we're recommending denial of a variance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2013)|
| 0:33:36| but in reality we're still recommending a variance for that same request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2016)|
| 0:33:43| And where that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2023)|
| 0:33:49| it's on road C, which is this little intersection here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2029)|
| 0:33:56| They're requesting a vertical curve variance at this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2036)|
| 0:34:00| Basically the road kind of dips down and then back up again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2040)|
| 0:34:05| So they're requesting, or the county engineers wanted that to be flattened out a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2045)|
| 0:34:09| so it's not abrupt of a sag curve right there at the intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2049)|
| 0:34:16| Mike, a couple of quick questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2056)|
| 0:34:19| What's the maximum grade on a collector road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2059)|
| 0:34:23| On this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2063)|
| 0:34:24| Well, this one is what, 11% or 10%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2064)|
| 0:34:30| Let me go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2070)|
| 0:34:34| Sorry, I need to back up just a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2074)|
| 0:34:42| Where was that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2082)|
| 0:34:45| I think it was 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2085)|
| 0:34:46| Yeah, 11.5, is that what it is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2086)|
| 0:34:48| Yeah, 11.5% grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2088)|
| 0:34:50| And what are the requirements for the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2090)|
| 0:34:53| Are those that complies with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2093)|
| 0:34:56| Yeah, and so the subdivision regulations don't address collector roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2096)|
| 0:35:02| They pretty much only address local streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2102)|
| 0:35:05| They point to the jurisdictional standards for those types of roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2105)|
| 0:35:10| and maybe, Jim, you might be able to elaborate further,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2110)|
| 0:35:16| but my understanding is that they use the TDOT standard for that particular type of road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2116)|
| 0:35:24| And I don't know, I'm not sure if it's 12% is the maximum that's permissible or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2124)|
| 0:35:31| but on the TDOT road or if they specified in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2131)|
| 0:35:34| But I know it had cross-section standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2134)|
| 0:35:41| I believe they used AASHTO standards for verticals and horizontals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2141)|
| 0:35:47| The response I received from county engineering was that this, like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2147)|
| 0:35:53| the road grade and horizontal curves and vertical curves on the main roads were appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2153)|
| 0:36:00| And acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2160)|
| 0:36:02| And what about turn lanes onto Everett as well as the other one, Colorado?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2162)|
| 0:36:10| There's a condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2170)|
| 0:36:15| I guess my concern, Mike, is that we don't know what's going in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2175)|
| 0:36:19| And if the county accepts responsibility for the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2179)|
| 0:36:22| and then something that really creates a lot of traffic impact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2182)|
| 0:36:27| well, we're going to be back in there making changes to it before it's even hardly used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2187)|
| 0:36:33| Yeah, so with the conditions of the approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2193)|
| 0:36:36| we're trying to tighten down exactly what can happen on the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2196)|
| 0:36:41| There is a condition that they cannot connect to Everett Road without a traffic study being done first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2201)|
| 0:36:47| And we're also recommending a condition that if they submit a final plat for the road system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2207)|
| 0:36:55| before they come back with a new concept plan with a traffic impact study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2215)|
| 0:36:59| then they have to put a note on the final plat saying that no access will be provided to the internal streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2219)|
| 0:37:07| until that new concept plan and traffic impact study is done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2227)|
| 0:37:12| I mean, they do have access to external roads and to part of their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2232)|
| 0:37:17| So, I mean, they could technically do a little bit of work out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2237)|
| 0:37:21| and stay connected to an existing road and not their internal road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2241)|
| 0:37:24| But the intent is to make sure that that comes back to us with a traffic study and the improvements are done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2244)|
| 0:37:33| So additional improvements will be required, you think, after?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2253)|
| 0:37:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2256)|
| 0:37:37| Chairman Phillips, Jim Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2257)|
| 0:37:39| Yeah, we've actually spoke with the developer and TDOT as late as last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2259)|
| 0:37:45| spoke with the chief engineer at TDOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2265)|
| 0:37:49| What the county is part of the county's commission meeting in December,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2269)|
| 0:37:54| we're asking for TDOT to approve a local interstate connector project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2274)|
| 0:37:59| which is a project that the state uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2279)|
| 0:38:02| It's kind of a grant that pays 50% to actually improve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2282)|
| 0:38:08| One of the things identified in the Hardin Valley mobility study is the connection into Hardin Valley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2288)|
| 0:38:14| and the limited mobility there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2294)|
| 0:38:17| and getting a large volume of traffic across Campbell Station is very difficult topography.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2297)|
| 0:38:23| So we think there's a lot of value in providing a larger facility here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2303)|
| 0:38:28| to provide access into the west side of Hardin Valley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2308)|
| 0:38:32| much more from an economical and cost-effective standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2312)|
| 0:38:38| as well as we've asked TDOT to identify that interchange for a single-point interchange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2318)|
| 0:38:45| We've asked them to modify the interchange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2325)|
| 0:38:48| We've actually even offered to pay for the design of the interchange| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2328)|
| 0:38:51| because we realize that the interchange and the roads leading up to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2331)|
| 0:38:55| are going to be problematic with this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2335)|
| 0:38:58| So I think that there are a couple of things that the county has at play here that would assist this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2338)|
| 0:39:04| and we have looked at the design standards of the road, and we're okay with that grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2344)|
| 0:39:09| It is at the upper limit of our comfort level, but we're okay with it at its current configuration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2349)|
| 0:39:16| Thank you, Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2356)|
| 0:39:22| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2362)|
| 0:39:23| Mike, did they end up kind of topping off this ridgeline to make this road grade work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2363)|
| 0:39:30| Is that how that worked?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2370)|
| 0:39:32| That's going to be part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2372)|
| 0:39:34| I mean, they couldn't go straight up the ridge without doing some switchback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2374)|
| 0:39:40| or just a much different alignment of a road, let's put it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2380)|
| 0:39:46| And in order to make developable areas, I mean, they really do need to flatten off part of that property up top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2386)|
| 0:39:58| That's, I guess, a question you can have for the developer, what the rationale there is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2398)|
| 0:40:03| but that's just looking at the plan is kind of what I'm seeing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2403)|
| 0:40:21| Comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2421)|
| 0:40:28| Thank you, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2428)|
| 0:40:29| So the next six items fall under Liz's review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2429)|
| 0:40:35| So number eight, Thunder Mountain Properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2435)|
| 0:40:39| She's switching them around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2439)|
| 0:40:40| You all have received a lot of correspondence on this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2440)|
| 0:40:43| It's for the property in South Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2443)|
| 0:40:45| Liz, how come you got all the good ones this month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2445)|
| 0:40:48| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2448)|
| 0:40:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2455)|
| 0:40:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2456)|
| 0:40:57| Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2457)|
| 0:41:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2461)|
| 0:41:02| So this is a revised application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2462)|
| 0:41:04| It was initially received for the November meeting for an approximate 64-acre area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2464)|
| 0:41:13| This was the original area of the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2473)|
| 0:41:17| The application was revised on November 5th to add an additional 95-acre area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2477)|
| 0:41:26| So now the total property included in the application for the rezoning and the plan amendment is approximately 158 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2486)|
| 0:41:35| It's in South Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2495)|
| 0:41:37| It's adjacent to Sevier Highway, east of Chapman or, sorry, adjacent to the Sevier County line and adjacent to Sevierville Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2497)|
| 0:41:49| and it is east of Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2509)|
| 0:41:52| So this is the Valgro Road industrial area that you might be familiar with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2512)|
| 0:41:57| So this is surrounding that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2517)|
| 0:42:02| And recently some improvements have been made where Sevierville Pike accesses Chapman Highway at this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2522)|
| 0:42:12| And the applicant is requesting to go from agriculture and hillside protection to low-density residential and hillside protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2532)|
| 0:42:24| They're also requesting a rezoning from the existing agricultural zoning, and there is some CA and CB zoning also on this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2544)|
| 0:42:37| as well as some RA in the corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2557)|
| 0:42:40| They are requesting for the entire thing to go up to four dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2560)|
| 0:42:50| And the applicant has, sorry, actually they are asking for it to go up to three dwelling units an acre for the entire area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2570)|
| 0:42:58| When they modified the application, it went to three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2578)|
| 0:43:01| So quickly just to look at the slopes in this area, in the first 64 acres that was applied for, you know, it's relatively flat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2581)|
| 0:43:11| There is some small area of hillside protection in this area, but it's quite small, about 7 1⁄2 acres of the 64 acres overall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2591)|
| 0:43:23| So then when the additional 95 acres came in for review, we ran a slope analysis for that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2603)|
| 0:43:31| and over 88 acres of the site are within the hillside protection area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2611)|
| 0:43:36| And there are very steep slopes out there, as you can see shown in the red.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2616)|
| 0:43:42| Most of the area over 44 acres of the site are slopes greater than 40%, so some challenging topography.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2622)|
| 0:43:53| And because of the topography challenges, the staff recommendation for the plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2633)|
| 0:44:00| is low-density residential and hillside protection for the 64-acre portion of the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2640)|
| 0:44:07| and then rural residential and hillside protection for the other 95-acre portion of the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2647)|
| 0:44:16| And this is primarily because of the access improvements that have occurred near Sevierville Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2656)|
| 0:44:22| or at Sevierville Pike, where it accesses Chapman Highway, and then the demand for additional housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2662)|
| 0:44:30| The rezoning is also split up based on some of the topographical challenges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2670)|
| 0:44:40| so staff is recommending planned residential up to three dwelling units an acre on the flatter portion of the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2680)|
| 0:44:48| and then for the steeper portion of the site, we're recommending up to one dwelling unit an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2688)|
| 0:44:55| And this is because of the steep slope constraints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2695)|
| 0:44:59| and the PR zone would require development plan review to address some of the environmental design challenges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2699)|
| 0:45:06| whereas the current agricultural zoning would not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2706)|
| 0:45:11| Are there questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2711)|
| 0:45:13| Liz, a couple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2713)|
| 0:45:18| Would it be possible, I mean, really, the ridge area, I mean, the steep slopes don't need to be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2718)|
| 0:45:24| Is it possible to use that acreage and density to move into those flatter areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2724)|
| 0:45:33| and increase the density in that area and try to preclude development along the slopes there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2733)|
| 0:45:41| Kind of balance it out and kind of protect, because that is awfully steep in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2741)|
| 0:45:46| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2746)|
| 0:45:47| You're talking about 40% is difficult development, particularly at one unit per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2747)|
| 0:45:52| So at the time of rezoning, without conditions placed on the rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2752)|
| 0:45:58| it would be, you know, probably impossible to make sure that that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2758)|
| 0:46:07| However, since both the planned residential zone districts that are recommended here will require use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2767)|
| 0:46:14| if they submit a development plan at the time of use on review for the entire area, the 158-acre area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2774)|
| 0:46:22| then they would be able to put the majority of the development in the flatland area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2782)|
| 0:46:32| However, that use on review application development plan would have to be tied to that whole area, the approval for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2792)|
| 0:46:40| So if they just came in for a development plan for just the three-dwelling unit per acre area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2800)|
| 0:46:48| then we wouldn't necessarily know what they intended to do with the density that remains for the other half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2808)|
| 0:46:55| So the time of use on review would be the time to try to encourage the concentration of the development in the flatter portion of the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2815)|
| 0:47:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2834)|
| 0:47:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2835)|
| 0:47:20| Okay, thank you, Liz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2840)|
| 0:47:23| Move on to item number 1312F21RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2843)|
| 0:47:27| Jason McMahan, applicant has requested PR and staff is recommending RA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2847)|
| 0:47:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2852)|
| 0:47:33| So this is east of Norris Freeway and the north side of Gordon Smith Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2853)|
| 0:47:41| This is Andersonville Pike, shown in green over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2861)|
| 0:47:44| You can also see the parental responsibility zones for the halls, schools in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2864)|
| 0:47:53| The property is just over an acre in size, and the applicant is requesting to go from the agricultural zone district to planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2873)|
| 0:48:03| They are seeking up to five dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2883)|
| 0:48:07| However, you know, the surrounding area is primarily zoned agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2887)|
| 0:48:11| It is adjacent to commercial zoning, but the lots in this area are mostly over a half acre in size or at least 20,000 square feet in size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2891)|
| 0:48:23| The reason for that or so the reason for the staff recommendation as RA rather than planned residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2903)|
| 0:48:31| up to five dwelling units per acre is because of these larger lot sizes in this area with primarily single family residential uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2911)|
| 0:48:39| And the RA will require lot sizes of at least 10,000 square feet if sewer is available or 20,000 square feet if not served by sewer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2919)|
| 0:48:49| So the RA zoning seems to be more in character than the PR up to five for this lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2929)|
| 0:48:57| It's also quite small in size and not really challenged by topography or other environmental issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2937)|
| 0:49:09| Questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2949)|
| 0:49:15| Thanks, Liz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2955)|
| 0:49:17| Item number 15, 12H21RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2957)|
| 0:49:23| I'm sorry, number 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2963)|
| 0:49:25| Robert Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2965)|
| 0:49:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2966)|
| 0:49:27| So this is the east side of Alcoa Highway at the entrance of the Martha Washington Heights neighborhood adjacent to Mount Vernon Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2967)|
| 0:49:38| and the new frontage road that is part of the Alcoa Highway improvements, Dresser Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2978)|
| 0:49:45| The applicant is asking to go from low density residential on the sector plan to an expansion of the mixed use special district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2985)|
| 0:49:55| that is shown along Alcoa Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2995)|
| 0:49:58| They're also asking to rezone from a mix of RB zoning and RA zoning to extend the shopping center zone district that is just to the south of here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=2998)|
| 0:50:13| And one of the reasons we're discussing this item is related to the concerns that have been expressed by the adjacent neighborhood abutting this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3013)|
| 0:50:26| So the applicant is also asking to extend this mixed use special district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3026)|
| 0:50:31| It allows consideration of a mix of office and commercial uses, which would include the shopping center zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3031)|
| 0:50:41| So this is a 2016 aerial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3041)|
| 0:50:44| We can see the parcel had very limited access to Mount Vernon Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3044)|
| 0:50:48| However, the construction of Dresser Road as part of the Alcoa Highway improvements has provided additional frontage for this parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3048)|
| 0:51:01| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3061)|
| 0:51:02| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3062)|
| 0:51:03| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3063)|
| 0:51:06| So you can see now this is the 2020 aerial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3066)|
| 0:51:09| You can see that there is additional frontage for this parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3069)|
| 0:51:14| The parcel was also reduced in size during right away acquisition for Dresser Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3074)|
| 0:51:21| The SC zone district requires a 50 foot setback when adjacent to residential and requires a development plan to be approved by the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3081)|
| 0:51:32| The existing RA zoning could permit three to four houses with 10,000 square foot lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3092)|
| 0:51:40| It would also require 75 foot lot widths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3100)|
| 0:51:43| However, the setbacks would be only eight to 12 feet adjacent to the Martha Washington Heights neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3103)|
| 0:51:50| And the lot sizes in this adjacent neighborhood range from approximately 15,000 square feet in size to over 36,000 square feet in size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3110)|
| 0:52:01| And the lot widths are generally larger than 100 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3121)|
| 0:52:06| So because of the development plan that is required as part of the shopping center zone district and the significant setbacks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3126)|
| 0:52:18| staff is recommending extension of this shopping center zone district to this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3138)|
| 0:52:29| Are there questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3149)|
| 0:52:34| Liz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3154)|
| 0:52:37| What would you say the distance is from the back of the section that is currently mixed use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3157)|
| 0:52:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3166)|
| 0:52:48| It looks like there's a lot of green space there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3168)|
| 0:52:50| There is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3170)|
| 0:52:51| So what would you say that green space is from the end of that commercial development to the beginning of the lot line for the houses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3171)|
| 0:53:00| I mean, it appears to be at least 100 feet, maybe more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3180)|
| 0:53:05| You know, if this is 111 feet at this location, it's pretty close to that right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3185)|
| 0:53:11| And so, I mean, while that's just the way that is at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3191)|
| 0:53:16| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3196)|
| 0:53:18| The area that's being applied for, that would now be how much less?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3198)|
| 0:53:26| 50 feet is the minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3206)|
| 0:53:29| You know, that's just it's a minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3209)|
| 0:53:31| They could choose to do more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3211)|
| 0:53:34| You know, I think, honestly, given the significant setbacks for this parcel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3214)|
| 0:53:38| it would be challenging to develop it as the shopping center zone district on its own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3218)|
| 0:53:44| If there was some larger redevelopment that came into this area, particularly because there is a lot of vacancy here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3224)|
| 0:53:52| then this would give them the opportunity to have some additional area for a larger redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3232)|
| 0:54:01| Seems like with all the vacancy there and the small amount of buffer that's provided by the existing trees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3241)|
| 0:54:10| that is a nice way to get into the neighborhood as opposed to having more empty commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3250)|
| 0:54:21| So is access on Mount Vernon Road not the new road, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3261)|
| 0:54:28| At the time of rezoning, we don't know where their access would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3268)|
| 0:54:33| You know, I imagine that they would perhaps be allowed to have some sort of access to Mount Vernon or Dresser Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3273)|
| 0:54:42| It would be up to, I believe the county would have a CISO for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3282)|
| 0:54:50| Would that be TDOT, Jim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3290)|
| 0:54:55| Yeah, Liz, we'd want to check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3295)|
| 0:54:56| I don't know. TDOT may have bought access control through there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3296)|
| 0:54:58| so we'd want to touch base with them to make sure because they may have restricted access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3298)|
| 0:55:08| I have the same question that I had on the other end of the parcel with the apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3308)|
| 0:55:18| On the sector plan, the sector plan says specifically that it was drawn up with all the changes on Alcoa Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3318)|
| 0:55:36| assumed that they were in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3336)|
| 0:55:40| So how do you say that the Alcoa Highway has changed when the sector plan assumed that it was in place when it was drawn up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3340)|
| 0:55:56| So the sector plan actually gave two alternative designs for land uses along the corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3356)|
| 0:56:04| because it was still up in the air when the sector plan was developed in 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3364)|
| 0:56:09| We didn't know if there would be frontage roads on both sides or one side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3369)|
| 0:56:15| so we didn't have a very clear idea of exactly what the design would be in 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3375)|
| 0:56:23| So we didn't know necessarily for sure that Dresser Road would come in at this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3383)|
| 0:56:30| It was on the table as a possibility, but we didn't know for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3390)|
| 0:56:37| That's really how it reads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3397)|
| 0:56:43| That's for Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3403)|
| 0:56:46| We're not going to decide it now, but that's how it reads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3406)|
| 0:56:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3416)|
| 0:56:57| Thank you, Liz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3417)|
| 0:56:59| Move on to item number 15, which is 12A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3419)|
| 0:57:03| Liz, you've been busy this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3423)|
| 0:57:04| Oh, my gosh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3424)|
| 0:57:05| She has been very busy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3425)|
| 0:57:07| 12H21RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3427)|
| 0:57:11| So this property is approximately four acres in size,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3431)|
| 0:57:15| and the applicant is requesting to go to RB, which is the county's general residential zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3435)|
| 0:57:22| This is in the Powell-Bell Campground community area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3442)|
| 0:57:26| This road is Bell Campground Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3446)|
| 0:57:28| It's a minor collector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3448)|
| 0:57:30| Clint Highway is just over in this area for reference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3450)|
| 0:57:35| This property does not have frontage on a public right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3455)|
| 0:57:39| but it is connected by a joint permanent easement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3459)|
| 0:57:42| or now we call it a private right-of-way to Bell Campground Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3462)|
| 0:57:51| And this is what the zoning looks like in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3471)|
| 0:57:55| The property is adjacent to RB zoning and agricultural zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3475)|
| 0:58:00| However, although there is a lot of RB zoning in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3480)|
| 0:58:08| the RB areas are primarily built out as single-family residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3488)|
| 0:58:13| and they are on lots that are ranging from over a half acre to over an acre in size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3493)|
| 0:58:20| So that is more consistent development intensity with the agricultural zone district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3500)|
| 0:58:27| and the RA low-density residential zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3507)|
| 0:58:31| So the lot is also covered by some hillside protection area on the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3511)|
| 0:58:42| and this entire area, even the existing RB zoned area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3522)|
| 0:58:46| shows up as low-density residential in the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3526)|
| 0:58:52| It's primarily a forested lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3532)|
| 0:58:54| and again you can see that it doesn't have direct access to Bell Campground Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3534)|
| 0:59:01| And the property is predominantly forested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3541)|
| 0:59:06| So I wanted to quickly show the differences between the RA and the RB zoned district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3546)|
| 0:59:14| So permitted residential uses in the RA zoned district include houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3554)|
| 0:59:20| Through use on review, you could be permitted to do duplexes in the RA zoned district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3560)|
| 0:59:27| In the RB zoned district, however, houses are permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3567)|
| 0:59:30| Multi-dwelling up to 12 dwelling units per acre is also permitted as a use by right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3570)|
| 0:59:37| As a use on review, you could potentially get up to 24 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3577)|
| 0:59:42| The setbacks are largely the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3582)|
| 0:59:46| However, RB allows additional height to accommodate multifamily uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3586)|
| 0:59:52| which would then require additional setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3592)|
| 0:59:57| So because of the development potential for RB in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3597)|
| 1:00:03| staff feels that that would be inconsistent with the existing development in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3603)|
| 1:00:10| and we are recommending denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3610)|
| 1:00:13| Questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3613)|
| 1:00:14| Liz, how many lots can you create off a private easement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3614)|
| 1:00:18| So the maximum is five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3618)|
| 1:00:21| They would, you know, I believe the applicant has at least sort of verbally communicated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3621)|
| 1:00:29| that they own a lot that is adjacent next door to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3629)|
| 1:00:35| So they might be able to figure out another access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3635)|
| 1:00:39| It's my understanding that they own this lot right here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3639)|
| 1:00:42| but they again would still have to put in, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3642)|
| 1:00:47| a substantial improvement for access at this location to be able to fully utilize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3647)|
| 1:00:52| the development potential for the RB zoning for this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3652)|
| 1:00:56| And currently this is the private right of way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3656)|
| 1:01:01| and so there's this lot, one, two, three, four lots using this right of way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3661)|
| 1:01:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3667)|
| 1:01:11| So you said there's already four houses on the private easement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3671)|
| 1:01:15| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3675)|
| 1:01:16| So they could only use one on this lot anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3676)|
| 1:01:19| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3679)|
| 1:01:20| Regardless of what the zoning is or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3680)|
| 1:01:23| Unless they figure out another access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3683)|
| 1:01:25| And bring the road up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3685)|
| 1:01:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3688)|
| 1:01:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3696)|
| 1:01:37| Seeing no more questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3697)|
| 1:01:39| Move on to item number 1612I21RZ, the safe harbor residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3699)|
| 1:01:43| This is another application that you all received a number of comments on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3703)|
| 1:01:48| So this is the south side of Couch Mill Road east of Caspian Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3708)|
| 1:01:55| and east of Steel Road in the Hardin Valley community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3715)|
| 1:01:59| This property is quite large, over 131 acres in size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3719)|
| 1:02:03| Couch Mill Road is a major collector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3723)|
| 1:02:07| And you can also see that it is within the parental responsibility zone of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3727)|

| 1:02:23| You can see that this is in the rural area of the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3743)|
| 1:02:29| With frontage on Couch Mill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3749)|
| 1:02:31| And this is, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3751)|
| 1:02:32| a minor collector leading to the planned growth area just past Steel Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3752)|
| 1:02:39| As a reminder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3759)|
| 1:02:40| this is the section of the growth policy plan that allows consideration of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3760)|
| 1:02:46| extension of low-density residential up to three dwelling units an acre into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3766)|

| 1:03:39| Staff is recommending, or sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3819)|
| 1:03:44| the application is they're asking to go from agriculture to planned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3824)|
| 1:03:50| residential up to three dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3830)|
| 1:03:53| And it's currently classified as rural residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3833)|
| 1:03:59| which allows consideration up to three dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3839)|
| 1:04:02| This is an excerpt of the rural residential part of the land use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3842)|
| 1:04:08| classification table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3848)|
| 1:04:11| And this is what the current land use designation is for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3851)|
| 1:04:20| This shows the zoning in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3860)|
| 1:04:23| You can see that it is largely agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3863)|
| 1:04:26| However, there is also some planned residential zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3866)|
| 1:04:29| It's mostly in the range of one to two dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3869)|
| 1:04:34| There are some development constraints on the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3874)|
| 1:04:38| This is showing the topography of this application area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3878)|
| 1:04:43| You can see these forefoot contours that are showing closed depressions on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3883)|
| 1:04:50| the property that are probable sinkholes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3890)|
| 1:04:52| You can also see this reflected in the slope map for this site as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3892)|
| 1:05:02| And because of the topographic constraints and the surrounding zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3902)|
| 1:05:10| staff is recommending planned residential up to two dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3910)|
| 1:05:17| Are there questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3917)|
| 1:05:21| So, Liz, I'm assuming then that you believe that the exceptions in 3.5 were met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3921)|
| 1:05:34| Let's go back to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3934)|
| 1:05:35| So we actually, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3935)|
| 1:05:37| received some communication from Knox County Engineering regarding the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3937)|
| 1:05:44| traffic impact letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3944)|
| 1:05:46| So if Jim is here, I might let you all provide some information related to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3946)|
| 1:05:56| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3956)|
| 1:05:58| Yeah, we had worked with the traffic engineer to provide him some documentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3958)|
| 1:06:03| and we were comfortable with his recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3963)|
| 1:06:06| They are proposing to widen Couch Mill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3966)|
| 1:06:09| It's about 18 feet now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3969)|
| 1:06:11| They're going to widen it to 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3971)|
| 1:06:13| And we've also talked briefly to them about the sidewalk ordinance says along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3973)|
| 1:06:20| your frontage so that we may ask them to supplement that instead of in their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3980)|
| 1:06:23| frontage offsite and built down to the Steel Road intersection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3983)|
| 1:06:28| which would create a nice pedestrian connectivity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3988)|
| 1:06:31| and maybe even a partnership with the intersection of Steel Road and Couch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3991)|
| 1:06:35| Mill and Sam Lee because with the development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3995)|
| 1:06:39| there is going to be some level of service issues there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=3999)|
| 1:06:42| and we think it would be helpful if we could partner with the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4002)|
| 1:06:45| and possibly improve it with a roundabout or something along those lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4005)|
| 1:06:52| So, Liz, getting back to the exceptions in 3.5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4012)|
| 1:06:56| it states what I think a maximum of two unless there are exceptions in 3.5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4016)|
| 1:07:05| if I read that right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4025)|
| 1:07:06| I'm reading part of the applicant's letter here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4026)|
| 1:07:08| It seems to have a reasonable case here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4028)|
| 1:07:12| and so I guess I'd just like to hear a little more from staff as to how much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4032)|
| 1:07:18| the applicant's letter was considered and if you agree or disagree with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4038)|
| 1:07:23| basis of their argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4043)|
| 1:07:25| Do you mean the traffic impact letter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4045)|
| 1:07:27| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4047)|
| 1:07:28| It looks like there was an applicant letter sent out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4048)|
| 1:07:31| It was a comment today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4051)|
| 1:07:32| Yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4052)|
| 1:07:33| Yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4053)|
| 1:07:36| I haven't had an opportunity to review that letter yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4056)|
| 1:07:39| so I can do that before the meeting on Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4059)|
| 1:07:41| We'll get a question for Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4061)|
| 1:07:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4062)|
| 1:07:51| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4071)|
| 1:07:54| All right, Liz, you've got one more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4074)|
| 1:07:55| Oh, Lord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4075)|
| 1:07:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4076)|
| 1:07:57| Number 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4077)|
| 1:08:00| I'm glad you guys are still awake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4080)|
| 1:08:03| We gave all our cases to Liz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4083)|
| 1:08:06| So this is also in the Hardin Valley community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4086)|
| 1:08:09| This is the north side of Hickory Creek Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4089)|
| 1:08:13| This is west side of Galahar Ferry Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4093)|
| 1:08:17| The applicant is requesting a plan amendment from agriculture and hillside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4097)|
| 1:08:23| protection to rural residential and hillside protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4103)|
| 1:08:27| They're also requesting rezoning from agriculture to planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4107)|
| 1:08:32| This property is approximately 24 acres in size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4112)|
| 1:08:37| It's currently shown as ag,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4117)|
| 1:08:40| and the sector plan request is for rural residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4120)|
| 1:08:48| There is some rural residential across the street from this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4128)|
| 1:08:52| There's also some LDR that is just down from here as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4132)|
| 1:08:57| It is across the street from Creekside Manor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4137)|
| 1:09:01| which was rezoned in 2013 to PR up to 2.8 dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4141)|
| 1:09:08| And it's a primarily forested site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4148)|
| 1:09:13| There are some steep slopes on the eastern side of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4153)|
| 1:09:19| But, however, you can see the slopes are not really that steep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4159)|
| 1:09:25| They do fall within the HP area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4165)|
| 1:09:27| but they're primarily within that zero to 15 percent range of slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4167)|
| 1:09:33| And although there are not a lot of steep slopes on the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4173)|
| 1:09:39| there does appear to be some indication of closed depressions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4179)|
| 1:09:43| possible sinkholes in this area as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4183)|
| 1:09:47| And because of the topography and the development intensity in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4187)|
| 1:09:52| surrounding area, staff is recommending up to three dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4192)|
| 1:09:58| We're also recommending rural residential and hillside protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4198)|
| 1:10:02| for the sector plan designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4202)|
| 1:10:07| Questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4207)|
| 1:10:12| Can you go back to that map that showed the other subdivisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4212)|
| 1:10:17| and their density real quick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4217)|
| 1:10:25| So this one is 2.8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4225)|
| 1:10:27| I don't know if you can see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4227)|
| 1:10:29| This one is PR up to 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4229)|
| 1:10:32| This is adjacent to PR up to 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4232)|
| 1:10:37| And we have PR up to 2.5 down here, PR up to 2 here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4237)|
| 1:10:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4245)|
| 1:10:49| Liz, correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4249)|
| 1:10:51| but I think we've talked about this a little bit before about some of the briefings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4251)|
| 1:10:58| and some of the training we've had, the need for additional density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4258)|
| 1:11:02| And it seems to me like, and maybe it's just my perception from today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4262)|
| 1:11:08| that staff usually recommends less density than what the proposer is proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4268)|
| 1:11:18| Can you address that to me a little bit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4278)|
| 1:11:21| Well, I mean, I think we generally look at a range of characteristics in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4281)|
| 1:11:30| So it's not intentional to necessarily always be less than what someone requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4290)|
| 1:11:37| But, you know, looking at this site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4297)|
| 1:11:41| and looking at the surrounding development characteristics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4301)|
| 1:11:44| we generally feel that this is the appropriate zoning density for this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4304)|
| 1:11:54| So I think it depends on multiple things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4314)|
| 1:11:58| not just that we think it should be lower than what's requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4318)|
| 1:12:01| And additionally, what you all see at these meetings are typically the more challenging properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4321)|
| 1:12:06| the ones where there's a lot of comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4326)|
| 1:12:08| And there's a lot of things that, you know, I was going to say, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4328)|
| 1:12:11| Liz isn't the only one working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4331)|
| 1:12:12| We have a lot of other cases, but those aren't necessarily controversial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4332)|
| 1:12:15| And most of those go on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4335)|
| 1:12:17| We might be just recommending what someone has asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4337)|
| 1:12:21| I was actually going to ask the opposite question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4341)|
| 1:12:23| because there's only one development that's even listed there as up to three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4343)|
| 1:12:28| and it's not clear that it was even built at three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4348)|
| 1:12:32| So how did you get to three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4352)|
| 1:12:36| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4356)|
| 1:12:37| Let's go to the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4357)|
| 1:12:40| So when we look at the slope analysis, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4360)|
| 1:12:43| even it recommended up to two dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4363)|
| 1:12:48| You know, we are getting a lot of requests for additional density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4368)|
| 1:12:54| obviously in Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4374)|
| 1:12:56| This area has had multiple traffic impact letters submitted as part of the additional rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4376)|
| 1:13:03| that have happened in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4383)|
| 1:13:06| So, you know, given that the site is not as constrained environmentally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4386)|
| 1:13:14| as some of the other sites that we look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4394)|
| 1:13:16| you know, there don't appear to be floodways or floodplain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4396)|
| 1:13:21| The slopes are pretty minimal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4401)|
| 1:13:24| It seems that developing this property at a little bit of a higher density makes more sense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4404)|
| 1:13:31| say, than some of the more topographically challenged areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4411)|
| 1:13:35| You know, Liz, I'm looking at the hillside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4415)|
| 1:13:42| Compare something to the chart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4422)|
| 1:13:46| And we've talked about this before, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4426)|
| 1:13:48| On the non-hillside, you only got two units per acre there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4428)|
| 1:13:53| when I think before we were allowing five units in the non-hillside per acre to come to this calculation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4433)|
| 1:14:04| And I think maybe we talked about this last month or the month before about figuring out exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4444)|
| 1:14:10| Because sometimes it's three there, sometimes it's two there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4450)|
| 1:14:14| Where do we base that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4454)|
| 1:14:15| I did also want to remind everyone that this is also in the rural area of the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4455)|
| 1:14:21| So, you know, generally we don't recommend above what the growth policy plan recommends for the rural area as staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4461)|
| 1:14:35| So that, you know, relays or plays into part of the decision-making on that zero to 15| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4475)|
| 1:14:46| and the areas not within the hillside area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4486)|
| 1:14:53| I have another general question about density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4493)|
| 1:14:56| I know that when we are looking at cases in the city a lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4496)|
| 1:15:00| there's a lot of conversations about transit related to density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4500)|
| 1:15:06| Is there any public transit in these areas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4506)|
| 1:15:09| No, there is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4509)|
| 1:15:11| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4511)|
| 1:15:21| Are there any other items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4521)|
| 1:15:23| Yeah, I was going to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4523)|
| 1:15:25| I was going to give Liz a break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4525)|
| 1:15:26| I think this is Michelle, but I wondered if she could kind of review application 12-D-21-UR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4526)|
| 1:15:34| It's a use and review by Tommy Hunt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4534)|
| 1:15:39| Did you have a specific question you wanted me to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4539)|
| 1:15:41| or would you just want me to review the whole thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4541)|
| 1:15:43| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4543)|
| 1:15:45| I was just concerned about the residential that surrounds the area and how you came up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4545)|
| 1:15:52| What's the application number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4552)|
| 1:15:54| It's 12-D-21-UR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4554)|
| 1:16:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4561)|
| 1:16:02| He is a dog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4562)|
| 1:16:10| So I don't have a presentation prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4570)|
| 1:16:12| 26.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4572)|
| 1:16:13| Item 26.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4573)|
| 1:16:14| Yeah, I will open it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4574)|
| 1:16:15| I've got the files open here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4575)|
| 1:16:18| So this is a request for a gas station slash convenience store slash restaurant with a drive-through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4578)|
| 1:16:26| This is located on Johnson and Shod at that intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4586)|
| 1:16:31| Let me pull that up on the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4591)|
| 1:16:36| So Shod Road comes through here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4596)|
| 1:16:38| This is Johnson along here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4598)|
| 1:16:41| And then looking at the major road plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4601)|
| 1:16:46| you can see that Shod Road is an arterial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4606)|
| 1:16:52| Okay, so going back into here, so we've got the gas station on the Shod Road side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4612)|
| 1:16:57| which is the side opposite the residential development along here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4617)|
| 1:17:01| This property is vacant to be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4621)|
| 1:17:04| They have two entry points along Shod Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4624)|
| 1:17:06| Both are right in, right out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4626)|
| 1:17:08| and then the main exit point and entry point that are two-way along Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4628)|
| 1:17:13| Traffic impact study recommended an additional turn lane on Johnson coming out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4633)|
| 1:17:18| additional turn lane on Shod Road going this way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4638)|
| 1:17:21| and also traffic signalization, which will come at a later time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4641)|
| 1:17:25| And looking at this, the zoning is CN, which does allow all three of these uses as a special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4645)|
| 1:17:31| That's why it's coming before you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4651)|
| 1:17:34| The CN zone has its own planting requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4654)|
| 1:17:39| Because it's got double frontage, the county allows for the applicant to decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4659)|
| 1:17:43| which part of the property will be reviewed as a side setback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4663)|
| 1:17:46| and which would be reviewed as a rear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4666)|
| 1:17:48| So this along here was the side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4668)|
| 1:17:50| This along here is the rear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4670)|
| 1:17:51| So that's the reason they've got 20 feet of planting along here at that adjacent side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4671)|
| 1:17:58| I'm sure a lot of your questions are going to be about the landscaping plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4678)|
| 1:18:01| due to some comments that came through from Knox County Planning Alliance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4681)|
| 1:18:05| so we'll go ahead and jump to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4685)|
| 1:18:08| So this is the landscaping plan that's shown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4688)|
| 1:18:11| These sort of white, bubbly circles are shrubs that grow to about three to four feet in height,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4691)|
| 1:18:19| and then these little clusters along here are evergreen trees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4699)|
| 1:18:22| that can grow up to 12 to 20 feet, I believe, in diameter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4702)|
| 1:18:28| So the CN zone requires for evergreen trees to be planted every 30 feet on center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4708)|
| 1:18:34| The clusters of evergreen trees are located from the outer to the outer at about 24 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4714)|
| 1:18:39| so it actually exceeds that because it's more than one every 30 groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4719)|
| 1:18:44| The shrub height grows to about three to four feet in height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4724)|
| 1:18:47| Just as a point of reference, typical headlights can range from 24 inches to up to 54 inches in height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4727)|
| 1:18:52| So staff feels like the shrubs would guide, would buffer from most headlights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4732)|
| 1:18:57| and the trees in groupings as opposed to a line of trees is more aesthetically pleasing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4737)|
| 1:19:02| than seeing just sort of an undulating green wall that a lot of evergreen trees planted in a row can be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4742)|
| 1:19:08| I also want to point out the fact that, and I can bring it up in the aerial view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4748)|
| 1:19:21| So a lot of these trees along through here are on the applicant's property performing a denser buffer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4761)|
| 1:19:27| so there's sort of the double vegetation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4767)|
| 1:19:29| There's the vegetation that's provided by the applicant and also the existing vegetation on that lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4769)|
| 1:19:35| Also looking at the landscaping plans, as someone's coming from Shod Road this way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4775)|
| 1:19:39| which is one of the more vulnerable points of the property, you've got much more dense vegetation along here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4779)|
| 1:19:44| There's shrubs and trees. These are all trees here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4784)|
| 1:19:47| So it really does sort of blind the view onto that property from approaching cars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4787)|
| 1:19:51| and of course you come around this way and you're sideways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4791)|
| 1:19:54| The drive-through window is located on this side, so it's on Johnson, away from that adjacent residential property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4794)|
| 1:20:00| So staff believes that these landscaping requirements help buffer it from the site, the sounds, the headlights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4800)|
| 1:20:08| those kinds of issues, and then tries to protect the privacy of that adjacent landowner as much as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4808)|
| 1:20:16| I'm trying to think if there's anything else I would need to cover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4816)|
| 1:20:19| I'm happy to entertain any questions anyone might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4819)|
| 1:20:24| Have you heard from the adjacent property owners on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4824)|
| 1:20:28| I have not. They've not reached out to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4828)|
| 1:20:31| And I actually haven't heard any questions from anyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4831)|
| 1:20:34| so the only one I have heard from is the Knox County Appliance Alliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4834)|
| 1:20:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4840)|
| 1:20:43| Is there a fence in this buffer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4843)|
| 1:20:47| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4847)|
| 1:20:48| Is this a Class A or Class B buffer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4848)|
| 1:20:51| Neither. So the county does have that requirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4851)|
| 1:20:54| but the CN has its own landscaping buffer requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4854)|
| 1:20:57| which are actually a bit more robust than the county's screening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4857)|
| 1:21:12| That concludes the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4872)|
| 1:21:14| I'll see everyone tomorrow night at Maple Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4874)|
| 1:21:18| If you have not already paid me, please do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211207?start=4878)|
