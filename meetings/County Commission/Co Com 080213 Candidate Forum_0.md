| 0:00:00| Before we get started, I would like for all the candidates to raise their hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=0)|
| 0:00:09| Jolie is going to give you a court ruling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=9)|
| 0:00:13| I think all of you will probably need to review it and have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=13)|
| 0:00:18| Please raise your hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=18)|
| 0:00:23| If you were not here Monday, the rules are each candidate will get five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=23)|
| 0:00:28| After your five minutes, the commissioners will ask you questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=28)|
| 0:00:36| After each district is over with all the applicants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=36)|
| 0:00:42| if anyone from that particular district would like to speak, you will have two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=42)|
| 0:00:49| We're going to jump right in on the sixth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=49)|
| 0:00:51| Tank, we should say, or any member of the public who wishes to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=51)|
| 0:00:54| Any member to speak on that particular district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=54)|
| 0:01:00| We have two candidates from the sixth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=60)|
| 0:01:04| The first candidate, Roger Coleman Kane, Jr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=64)|
| 0:01:17| Hello, I'm Roger Kane, and I'm looking to be put in as the interim county commissioner for District 6A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=77)|
| 0:01:23| I'm currently living in the Carnes community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=83)|
| 0:01:25| I've lived there since 1997.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=85)|
| 0:01:27| I have four children and a wife.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=87)|
| 0:01:29| They've all gone through the Carnes elementary, middle, and high school program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=89)|
| 0:01:33| My two oldest are athletes at the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=93)|
| 0:01:37| I'm a president of the Carnes Business Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=97)|
| 0:01:40| and has been the fair board president in the Carnes community for the last four or five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=100)|
| 0:01:45| I'm used to handling a lot of the phone calls that the people in the community come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=105)|
| 0:01:50| and they ask for things, whether it be related to the fair, how to rent the community club buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=110)|
| 0:01:57| who do I talk to about the Carnes community club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=117)|
| 0:02:02| I have my office right on Oak Ridge Highway just down from Grace Baptist Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=122)|
| 0:02:07| And since I'm centrally located in the Carnes community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=127)|
| 0:02:09| I feel I can be a good facilitator for getting the issues that the people in the sixth district have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=129)|
| 0:02:15| Before the commission, I'm active in the community in other ways, go to church in that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=135)|
| 0:02:23| So I'm very familiar with the issues in the Carnes area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=143)|
| 0:02:26| I've been involved with road projects that have gone on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=146)|
| 0:02:31| have had to make tough decisions sometimes that aren't particularly always pleasing to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=151)|
| 0:02:37| A road project that we were looking at putting in in front of the Ingalls grocery store on Oak Ridge Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=157)|
| 0:02:43| We had several people of a subdivision not particularly happy with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=163)|
| 0:02:48| But in looking at it and evaluating the project, it was for the betterment of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=168)|
| 0:02:54| Our fire department can now get out with pushing a button.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=174)|
| 0:02:57| Once the project is done, they'll be able to push a button and the lights will turn to red.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=177)|
| 0:03:01| The fire trucks can then get onto Oak Ridge Highway because sometimes they've had to sit for several minutes waiting for traffic to slow down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=181)|
| 0:03:08| We can get more business development in Carnes now because Ingalls will now develop their out parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=188)|
| 0:03:13| We had to work with a landowner in a trading of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=193)|
| 0:03:20| And, you know, we were able to also get Ingalls to raise their offer from $90,000 to $120,000 to help put that light in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=200)|
| 0:03:29| Although I'm not a big advocate of having lights every 15 feet, having one in front of the fire department we felt was important to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=209)|
| 0:03:37| I coordinate the trash pickups and the parades that go on in Carnes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=217)|
| 0:03:41| so I feel I'll be a good fit for the Carnes community as far as representation wise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=221)|
| 0:03:46| until the actual commissioner can be appointed after the election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=226)|
| 0:03:53| Are there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=233)|
| 0:03:58| Roger, two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=238)|
| 0:04:02| Well, I'll start with budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=242)|
| 0:04:04| Give me some examples of what budget that you've worked with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=244)|
| 0:04:07| and I'm sure you're aware of the size budget that we have here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=247)|
| 0:04:11| What have you done comparable to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=251)|
| 0:04:13| And then in the six-, eight-, or seven-month period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=253)|
| 0:04:16| what do you think if there's anything that can be accomplished for the 6th District during that timing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=256)|
| 0:04:20| particularly that you want to try to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=260)|
| 0:04:23| The first thing, I've worked for the same company since 1988, and although I'm an agent now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=263)|
| 0:04:27| I did work in the claims division as a manager and a supervisor in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=267)|
| 0:04:31| And we had pretty large budgets over there, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=271)|
| 0:04:33| I had 28 to 30 people that I had to budget for, office space to be budgeted for, claims cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=273)|
| 0:04:39| all that kind of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=279)|
| 0:04:40| So I'm able to look at stuff and evaluate it and see how it works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=280)|
| 0:04:44| and if it's going to be good for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=284)|
| 0:04:52| The other projects I would like to see is looking at the building developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=292)|
| 0:04:56| that's going to go on in the Carnes community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=296)|
| 0:04:58| I'd like to look at some infrastructure improvements in the Carnes community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=298)|
| 0:05:01| or the 6th District, rather, and just see what's out there that needs to be pushed through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=301)|
| 0:05:08| This project, the Ingalls project that I talked about, sat in the backwater for almost four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=308)|
| 0:05:13| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=313)|
| 0:05:14| And it was a perfect example of how community and government can come together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=314)|
| 0:05:20| and people will contribute and everybody gives and takes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=320)|
| 0:05:24| But until the business association decided to jump in with our 65 members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=324)|
| 0:05:28| and get in with TDOT and get everybody in a room and have them all kind of pounded out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=328)|
| 0:05:33| it was going to stay on the backwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=333)|
| 0:05:35| There's other projects in the Carnes community that aren't done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=335)|
| 0:05:37| We have road projects that have started and stopped, the Carnes Connector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=337)|
| 0:05:42| We'd like to see some road improvements along 131.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=342)|
| 0:05:45| We still have a one-lane bridge and a one-lane underpass that we need to try to get some things done with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=345)|
| 0:05:52| I think there's still some infrastructure projects that need to go on out there, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=352)|
| 0:05:57| And all those things are going to be important in the next six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=357)|
| 0:05:59| I don't want the 6th District just to sit there and languor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=359)|
| 0:06:03| because we don't have a real commissioner serving in that post.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=363)|
| 0:06:08| I want to be that real commissioner until Kathy Bryant or Brad Anders is able to take over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=368)|
| 0:06:14| and actually do what they're supposed to do once the election process is done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=374)|
| 0:06:18| Are you familiar with the mulch site out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=378)|
| 0:06:20| Have you ever been out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=380)|
| 0:06:21| Yes, I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=381)|
| 0:06:22| I've both been out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=382)|
| 0:06:23| We've had meetings out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=383)|
| 0:06:25| They've invited us out as the business association to show the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=385)|
| 0:06:28| I've bought mulch out there, and I've dropped off stuff to be mulched.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=388)|
| 0:06:31| And it's a big issue out there, especially a lot of the smell and the other issues that go on out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=391)|
| 0:06:39| A lot of the constituents are not happy with some of the things that have gone on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=399)|
| 0:06:43| and some of the deals that have gone on with that mulch facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=403)|
| 0:06:51| Thank you for stepping up and wanting to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=411)|
| 0:06:54| So I guess my question to you would be, why would you want to do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=414)|
| 0:06:59| I mean, you've talked about your experience and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=419)|
| 0:07:01| but why step up and say, I want to take this abuse for six months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=421)|
| 0:07:06| You know, I already kind of do a lot of what you guys do just in a non-paid, non-governmental function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=426)|
| 0:07:14| I mean, I'll take, as the fair board president, we're the last community fair in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=434)|
| 0:07:19| I'll take anywhere between 40 and 150 phone calls a day towards the last two or three weeks before the fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=439)|
| 0:07:25| And it's everything from how many tomatoes can I bring to where do I buy chickens to, you know, can I bring this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=445)|
| 0:07:32| And it's a huge amount of coordination, but it's what I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=452)|
| 0:07:34| And people say, well, you don't get paid to be the fair board president.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=454)|
| 0:07:37| And it's like, well, yeah, but if I don't do it, we won't have a fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=457)|
| 0:07:41| I'm just very community-minded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=461)|
| 0:07:43| You know, there are lots of good things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=463)|
| 0:07:45| When we moved to Carnes 11 years ago, it was a very rural, beautiful place that was all within a very short drive of West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=465)|
| 0:07:55| It's getting very congested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=475)|
| 0:07:56| It's getting very overbuilt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=476)|
| 0:08:00| But those are things that we have to work through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=480)|
| 0:08:03| And that's one of the reasons that we need to have somebody who's willing to stand up for the people of Carnes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=483)|
| 0:08:07| and be able to facilitate at the same time and get things processing and moving so we can get a better quality of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=487)|
| 0:08:13| You talked about one of the issues that I think is supreme there in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=493)|
| 0:08:19| and that when I first came on commission in 2004, you saw a lot of development in the 5th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=499)|
| 0:08:24| Now it's moving to the 6th District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=504)|
| 0:08:26| and you're seeing a lot of development on our agenda for the Metropolitan Planning Commission every month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=506)|
| 0:08:33| as well as the 7th District and others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=513)|
| 0:08:36| Your thoughts about development interests versus homeowner and neighborhood interests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=516)|
| 0:08:41| Development interests are things that have to be taken on a case-by-case basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=521)|
| 0:08:45| There is no pat answer that we're all against development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=525)|
| 0:08:49| I mean, the running joke in Carnes is that every time a farmer dies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=529)|
| 0:08:52| two subdivisions go up where the farmer used to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=532)|
| 0:08:55| And that's just a part of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=535)|
| 0:08:58| But if we keep up with infrastructure, I think that's where you get a lot of friction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=538)|
| 0:09:02| You know, we have 13,000 cars a day go through the Carnes red light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=542)|
| 0:09:08| And it's a two-lane, 20-mile-an-hour one direction, 30-mile-an-hour another country lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=548)|
| 0:09:14| It wasn't designed for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=554)|
| 0:09:16| But if infrastructure keeps up with development, I think you'll have a whole lot more people happy with the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=556)|
| 0:09:22| It's inevitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=562)|
| 0:09:23| We are the last undeveloped tract between all the development in Powell and all the development in West Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=563)|
| 0:09:30| you know, Hardin Valley, Turkey Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=570)|
| 0:09:32| We're it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=572)|
| 0:09:33| We're left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=573)|
| 0:09:34| The people of Carnes have, you know, relinquished the idea that we're going to have to be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=574)|
| 0:09:39| But if it's smart development, that's what they're looking at, not just, you know, rampant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=579)|
| 0:09:44| just tearing everything down and just putting up anything that you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=584)|
| 0:09:49| It has to be smart development, and there has to be infrastructure that goes along with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=589)|
| 0:09:53| When you leave August 31st, looking back on the six months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=593)|
| 0:09:56| what would you like to look at and say, this is the one thing I've accomplished or would like to accomplish?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=596)|
| 0:10:04| Well, I don't really know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=604)|
| 0:10:05| I don't know what's actually on the agenda that we can accomplish in six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=605)|
| 0:10:08| I mean, although there's things on an agenda that should be taking three weeks, four weeks, five weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=608)|
| 0:10:14| I mean, you guys have seen how things can actually come to a crawl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=614)|
| 0:10:18| You know, I would like to just be able to get the budget prepared, get all that stuff done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=618)|
| 0:10:24| I'm guessing that that's going to be coming up before the August appointments, if I'm not wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=624)|
| 0:10:29| And just make it easier for either Kathy or Brad to get in here and do the work of the 6th District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=629)|
| 0:10:35| and not have to worry about – I'm a very – I do a lot of administrative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=635)|
| 0:10:40| That's what I'm good at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=640)|
| 0:10:41| I like to go through, get everything analyzed, get everything done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=641)|
| 0:10:44| and then let other people get out there and do the showmanship stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=644)|
| 0:10:49| If you are – if you do receive the appointment, would you insist on being sworn in immediately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=649)|
| 0:10:54| or would you wait for the swearing-in ceremony?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=654)|
| 0:10:56| Swearing-in ceremony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=656)|
| 0:10:58| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=658)|
| 0:11:00| One issue that has come up and certainly will probably come up in the six or seven months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=660)|
| 0:11:06| will be tax increment financing, TIFs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=666)|
| 0:11:10| Your position on when they're appropriate, when they're not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=670)|
| 0:11:15| TIFs are useful when you have a blighted area or an area needing development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=675)|
| 0:11:20| I am currently not aware of anywhere in Carnes or in the 6th District that that would apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=680)|
| 0:11:26| I saw it in the paper at least used well for the development around the Gay Street area where –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=686)|
| 0:11:32| I believe that's where they were using TIFs to help get business owners and things back in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=692)|
| 0:11:36| That, to me, is a good use of a TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=696)|
| 0:11:40| The Halls area, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=700)|
| 0:11:42| I don't know enough about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=702)|
| 0:11:43| It didn't seem to be a blighted area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=703)|
| 0:11:45| Business seemed to be going out there and doing what they needed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=705)|
| 0:11:49| But you guys know more about it than I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=709)|
| 0:11:51| I'm just looking at what the Knox New Sentinel tells me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=711)|
| 0:11:57| Roger, one of the projects that we have going on in the 6th District right now is a skate park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=717)|
| 0:12:04| We're working toward making that a reality, working with both government and with the private sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=724)|
| 0:12:11| How do you feel about skate parks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=731)|
| 0:12:13| Do you support them, against them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=733)|
| 0:12:17| I went to a fundraiser a couple of weeks ago over at Ironwood Studios| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=737)|
| 0:12:23| where they were doing a fundraiser for the skate parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=743)|
| 0:12:26| I think we need all sorts of different avenues for our kids to be out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=746)|
| 0:12:29| whether it be Frisbee, golf, or whether it be –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=749)|
| 0:12:32| my attitude is if you keep them busy with activities, it keeps them from drugs and other things worse than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=752)|
| 0:12:39| People have issues sometimes with the kind of people that come with a skate park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=759)|
| 0:12:44| but I think it can be run just like the newest one they just opened up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=764)|
| 0:12:48| You can run it as an example, and it can still be –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=768)|
| 0:12:51| you have set hours and curfew times and stuff like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=771)|
| 0:12:54| and that kind of eliminates some of the problems that you might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=774)|
| 0:13:01| Roger, I've got another question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=781)|
| 0:13:03| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=783)|
| 0:13:04| This may not be a fair question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=784)|
| 0:13:05| You may not know the answer to this, but you just got through an election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=785)|
| 0:13:08| and in the 6th district there, do you know how many votes that you got from the precincts there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=788)|
| 0:13:13| I came in second or third in most of the precincts, whether it be 63 or 63 North or Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=793)|
| 0:13:21| It really depended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=801)|
| 0:13:22| Some of them were second, and some of them were third.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=802)|
| 0:13:25| Overall, I got 4,600 votes countywide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=805)|
| 0:13:27| but the majority of my power base was in the northwest section in the Carnes area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=807)|
| 0:13:33| I think I got 62 votes in Carter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=813)|
| 0:13:38| But most of them were the Hardin Valley, Carnes, Powell area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=818)|
| 0:13:42| because that's where my name recognition was best through all the business association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=822)|
| 0:13:46| and the fairs and all the other stuff that I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=826)|
| 0:13:49| I'm familiar with all your work that you've done with the business professional associations and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=829)|
| 0:13:57| Is there any other commissioner who would like to ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=837)|
| 0:14:03| Thank you, Mr. Cain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=843)|
| 0:14:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=844)|
| 0:14:05| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=845)|
| 0:14:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=846)|
| 0:14:07| Robert F. Roundtree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=847)|
| 0:14:17| Good evening, Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=857)|
| 0:14:18| Thank you for the opportunity that allows me to present to you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=858)|
| 0:14:22| I'm very grateful for this chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=862)|
| 0:14:24| Bob, I need your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=864)|
| 0:14:26| Bob Roundtree, 221 Mayview Drive, Powell, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=866)|
| 0:14:33| I have lived at 221 Mayview Drive in the 6th District for 22 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=873)|
| 0:14:37| and I have never considered living anywhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=877)|
| 0:14:41| I'm married to Barbara.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=881)|
| 0:14:43| We celebrate our 35th anniversary next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=883)|
| 0:14:47| We have two grown children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=887)|
| 0:14:49| My son Bart is 28 and a graduate of Tennessee Wesleyan College.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=889)|
| 0:14:54| Our daughter, Sarah Buff Pratt, graduated with her master's degree from the University of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=894)|
| 0:15:00| and is in her fourth year of marketing teaching at Central High School in Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=900)|
| 0:15:09| I am interested in this appointment because I believe that I can make a difference in the 6th District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=909)|
| 0:15:15| and for Knox County over the next seven months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=915)|
| 0:15:18| I have never pursued an elected office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=918)|
| 0:15:21| and at this time I have no burning desire to do that going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=921)|
| 0:15:26| I graduated from the University of Tennessee College of Agriculture in 1977| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=926)|
| 0:15:31| with a bachelor of science degree in wildlife and fishery science.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=931)|
| 0:15:35| In 1978, I accepted a position with TVA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=935)|
| 0:15:39| and I served for 17 years as a public safety officer and supervisor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=939)|
| 0:15:43| My responsibilities included performing law enforcement, fire protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=943)|
| 0:15:48| visitor reception, and EMT services at many TVA facilities in East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=948)|
| 0:15:56| I have a great respect for the law enforcement personnel in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=956)|
| 0:16:00| because I was once one of those guys, and I really respect them and the job they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=960)|
| 0:16:06| In 1995, I retired from the Tennessee Valley Authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=966)|
| 0:16:10| and began working for the Public Building Authority as the manager of security and life safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=970)|
| 0:16:16| I was later promoted to the position of director of property management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=976)|
| 0:16:20| and served in that role until September of last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=980)|
| 0:16:27| In this role, I worked closely with two Knox County administrations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=987)|
| 0:16:32| the directors of every Knox County office, and numerous elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=992)|
| 0:16:37| I was responsible for directing TVA's facility management role at many Knox County properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=997)|
| 0:16:43| including the libraries, the senior centers, and the health departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1003)|
| 0:16:48| I also managed the city county building, the Andrew Johnson building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1008)|
| 0:16:52| and the old Knox County courthouse properties for Knox County and the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1012)|
| 0:16:57| That portfolio included more than 1.5 million square feet of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1017)|
| 0:17:02| 23 acres of public parkland, and had a budget of approximately $10 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1022)|
| 0:17:08| I also directed the maintenance, the custodial, and the horticultural activities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1028)|
| 0:17:13| for the city of Knoxville at World's Fair Park and Volunteer Landing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1033)|
| 0:17:17| I worked closely with two Knox County, city of Knoxville administrations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1037)|
| 0:17:22| and senior staffs on these projects and others to include the new Regal Riviera 8 theater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1042)|
| 0:17:32| My military career includes 26 years of service in the Tennessee Air National Guard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1052)|
| 0:17:37| at McGee-Tyson Air Force Base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1057)|
| 0:17:39| I retired in 1997 with the rank of Master Sergeant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1059)|
| 0:17:43| My entire career in the Air National Guard was spent in the fire protection career field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1063)|
| 0:17:49| In 1999, I was awarded the Master of Science degree in Safety Education and Services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1069)|
| 0:17:54| from the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1074)|
| 0:17:56| I attended classes in the evening, on weekends, all while working full time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1076)|
| 0:18:03| My community involvement includes more than 20 years of support to youth baseball,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1083)|
| 0:18:08| many of those years working with kids in the 6th District who have gone to school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1088)|
| 0:18:14| and moved back and now reside in our district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1094)|
| 0:18:18| I am a member of the Board of Directors for the Jubilee Community Arts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1098)|
| 0:18:22| and a longtime volunteer and supporter of the Amateur Athletic Union athletic programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1102)|
| 0:18:28| which were held in Knoxville last summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1108)|
| 0:18:33| The 6th District commissioners will face several significant issues over the next seven months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1113)|
| 0:18:38| Besides approving next year's budget, the Hardin Valley Academy will be opening in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1118)|
| 0:18:44| The Callahan and Emery Road corridors and the Hardin Valley community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1124)|
| 0:18:48| continue to experience tremendous growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1128)|
| 0:18:51| It will be imperative that the 6th District commissioners balance the wants and the needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1131)|
| 0:18:57| of the developers with those of the neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1137)|
| 0:19:00| The 6th District is the fastest growing district in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1140)|
| 0:19:03| and must continue to have sound leadership in the months to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1143)|
| 0:19:08| I am confident that my education, my training, my people skills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1148)|
| 0:19:14| and my experience working in government qualifies me as a candidate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1154)|
| 0:19:18| worthy of your consideration for this appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1158)|
| 0:19:21| Thank you very much for allowing me to address you this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1161)|
| 0:19:25| Are there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1165)|
| 0:19:32| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1172)|
| 0:19:34| Bob, there is a movement to try to get Hardin Valley Road to be designated a scenic highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1174)|
| 0:19:46| so that billboards can't be placed along that stretch of road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1186)|
| 0:19:51| Is that something you could support?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1191)|
| 0:19:56| Commissioner Lutho, that's the first I've heard of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1196)|
| 0:19:59| But personally, that would be very difficult for me to support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1199)|
| 0:20:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1203)|
| 0:20:04| And why would that be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1204)|
| 0:20:07| I'm like you guys when I travel down I-75.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1207)|
| 0:20:11| I see the billboards to get off to find a place to eat or a place to gas up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1211)|
| 0:20:17| But I just think I've known Hardin Valley since I was a kid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1217)|
| 0:20:20| I remember when it was a two-lane road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1220)|
| 0:20:24| and my mother and father used to take us out there to swim in Melton Hill Lake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1224)|
| 0:20:28| And it's a beautiful place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1228)|
| 0:20:30| and I just don't know that billboards would be appropriate for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1230)|
| 0:20:35| Well, that's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1235)|
| 0:20:36| Would you support it being a scenic highway so that they could not place billboards along Hardin Valley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1236)|
| 0:20:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1244)|
| 0:20:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1245)|
| 0:20:46| So you would support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1246)|
| 0:20:47| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1247)|
| 0:20:48| I misunderstood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1248)|
| 0:20:49| You surprised me by surprise with that answer, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1249)|
| 0:20:52| That happens with me sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1252)|
| 0:20:56| Some of the questions that you've probably heard, again, is land use issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1256)|
| 0:21:01| and trying to decide when someone comes to force on a zoning issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1261)|
| 0:21:08| and you have maybe a neighborhood group with their concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1268)|
| 0:21:15| and, of course, you have the property owner or the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1275)|
| 0:21:18| with trying to do something with a piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1278)|
| 0:21:21| and trying to make a balance between landowner's rights versus community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1281)|
| 0:21:29| and neighborhood, you know, concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1289)|
| 0:21:31| What factors would you use to weigh that balance in trying to make a decision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1291)|
| 0:21:40| With regards to the homeowners and the neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1300)|
| 0:21:44| I think that development must keep up front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1304)|
| 0:21:48| and in the open the thought process that this development is not going to devalue an individual's property value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1308)|
| 0:21:59| or take away from their quality of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1319)|
| 0:22:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1323)|
| 0:22:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1324)|
| 0:22:08| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1328)|
| 0:22:09| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1329)|
| 0:22:10| There's been a suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1330)|
| 0:22:11| I want to go back to your role in public building authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1331)|
| 0:22:14| that perhaps the county does not need the Andrew Johnson Building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1334)|
| 0:22:17| Sell that building and move the offices that are there to other locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1337)|
| 0:22:21| Do you think we need the Andrew Johnson Building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1341)|
| 0:22:25| Commissioner Hammond, the Andrew Johnson Building is on the National Registry of Historic Places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1345)|
| 0:22:34| We've all seen the growth of residential relocation downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1354)|
| 0:22:40| If you were to sell the Andrew Johnson Building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1360)|
| 0:22:43| you have got to find a place to relocate the school administrative staff to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1363)|
| 0:22:49| and that could be as expensive as what you might gain in earnings from the sale of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1369)|
| 0:22:59| Personally, I think the school staff is well situated downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1379)|
| 0:23:07| They're close to the administrative activities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1387)|
| 0:23:10| and the legislative activities that you folks perform every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1390)|
| 0:23:15| And I really believe that unless there is a greater demand for that building than I'm aware of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1395)|
| 0:23:23| then they're well situated where they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1403)|
| 0:23:27| As I recall, that building is almost paid off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1407)|
| 0:23:30| I mean, I don't have the exact figures, but I think they were close to maybe having that building paid off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1410)|
| 0:23:34| Paul, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1414)|
| 0:23:35| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1415)|
| 0:23:36| I believe it's paid off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1416)|
| 0:23:38| It may already be paid off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1418)|
| 0:23:40| What effect is the Orange Route or proposed Orange Route having there in the 6th District?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1420)|
| 0:23:44| I know that from time to time people will come to us with some rezonings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1424)|
| 0:23:48| and it's land that's in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1428)|
| 0:23:51| And they're saying, well, we're just going to go ahead and roll the dice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1431)|
| 0:23:54| and we'll go ahead and do some development there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1434)|
| 0:23:56| And we don't think the Orange Route will ever be built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1436)|
| 0:23:58| or if it is, it's going to be 20 years from now or 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1438)|
| 0:24:02| How does the Orange Route affect what's going on there in the 6th District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1442)|
| 0:24:05| or the proposed route, I should say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1445)|
| 0:24:07| Commissioner Hammond, I've paid attention to the east side of Clinton Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1447)|
| 0:24:13| more so than the west side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1453)|
| 0:24:17| I do know where it's scheduled to route to through Raccoon Valley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1457)|
| 0:24:20| but it would probably not be best for me to answer that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1460)|
| 0:24:25| because I'm not that familiar with that Orange Route location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1465)|
| 0:24:31| I've read about that route for several years, but I haven't studied it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1471)|
| 0:24:37| And that's something that certainly is going to impact the 6th District greatly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1477)|
| 0:24:43| And someone, whether it's the next elected official or Commissioner Lambert,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1483)|
| 0:24:49| will certainly be dealing with that in a year or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1489)|
| 0:24:55| When you leave and you look back on your six to seven months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1495)|
| 0:24:58| what would you like to look back and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1498)|
| 0:25:02| I tried to accomplish this or was able to accomplish it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1502)|
| 0:25:04| In other words, what is your priority?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1504)|
| 0:25:06| Like I said in my remarks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1506)|
| 0:25:08| I think it's critical that we get Hardin Valley Academy opened on time and in budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1508)|
| 0:25:14| And I think that that's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1514)|
| 0:25:22| I would like to say that in my seven months of service that I added value to this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1522)|
| 0:25:30| And I would like probably more so to know that I earned the respect of this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1530)|
| 0:25:40| by serving for seven short months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1540)|
| 0:25:44| And will you be willing to wait to be sworn in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1544)|
| 0:25:47| If you would like, I'll be the last one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1547)|
| 0:25:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1550)|
| 0:25:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1551)|
| 0:25:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1552)|
| 0:25:53| What about the standards you would apply to TIFs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1553)|
| 0:25:55| Pardon me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1555)|
| 0:25:56| The standards you would apply to tax increment financing or TIFs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1556)|
| 0:26:00| Commissioner Harmon, I probably give you the same answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1560)|
| 0:26:03| and I've been to both public forums, both candidate forums,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1563)|
| 0:26:06| probably give you the same answer that most of the other candidates have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1566)|
| 0:26:13| It has to be determined on a case-by-case basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1573)|
| 0:26:19| But of utmost importance is, in the end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1579)|
| 0:26:24| it has to be good for the citizens and the taxpayers of this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1584)|
| 0:26:34| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1594)|
| 0:26:35| Go ahead, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1595)|
| 0:26:37| Bob, you're saying you're over all the buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1597)|
| 0:26:39| How many buildings are you over total?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1599)|
| 0:26:42| I was, Larry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1602)|
| 0:26:43| Gosh, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1603)|
| 0:26:44| I lost count.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1604)|
| 0:26:47| Numbers up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1607)|
| 0:26:48| Yeah, it was more than 60, maybe 70.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1608)|
| 0:26:50| In your opinion, what's our biggest need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1610)|
| 0:26:54| What's in the very near future that we really need to be paying attention at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1614)|
| 0:27:01| that needs replaced or anything on the radar screen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1621)|
| 0:27:06| Probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1626)|
| 0:27:08| Will it be a library school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1628)|
| 0:27:10| Some of the libraries, the Sequoia Library,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1630)|
| 0:27:12| the Norwood Library are taking a lot of the county's money just to condition them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1632)|
| 0:27:22| just to heat them, just to air condition them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1642)|
| 0:27:25| They were built back in the 60s, and I'm sure you've seen both those facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1645)|
| 0:27:32| Those are great libraries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1652)|
| 0:27:35| They serve a tremendous need in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1655)|
| 0:27:38| They're well used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1658)|
| 0:27:40| And I'm not sure the Norwood Library actually has enough room any longer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1660)|
| 0:27:46| and we know what happened out there the other night when the folks went out there to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1666)|
| 0:27:51| So those are some of your older buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1671)|
| 0:27:53| But I can tell you this, and I know this for a fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1673)|
| 0:27:57| PBA has taken excellent care of your properties with a limited staff and a limited budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1677)|
| 0:28:07| Those properties right now are in a lot better shape than they were five years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1687)|
| 0:28:14| when the public building authority first started managing this portfolio of properties for Noss County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1694)|
| 0:28:22| Do you see any conflict of interest of anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1702)|
| 0:28:25| I have no conflict of interest other than, like I stated in my remarks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1705)|
| 0:28:29| that my daughter is a young teacher at Central High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1709)|
| 0:28:34| And this is for you and Mr. Kane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1714)|
| 0:28:36| I forgot to mention this to him, but do you realize that you're appointed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1716)|
| 0:28:39| that you will be sitting next to Lumpy Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1719)|
| 0:28:42| Well, you know, I saw a billboard about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1722)|
| 0:28:46| And you don't get paid any extra for it either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1726)|
| 0:28:52| Short note, I met Greg for the first time a couple of days ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1732)|
| 0:28:57| and I found him at his uncle's boat shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1737)|
| 0:29:03| And I'm glad I did because his uncle runs a very, very good operation where they weld aluminum boats,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1743)|
| 0:29:16| and the eye hook on my new boat is about to fall off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1756)|
| 0:29:19| So I've got to get down there and see him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1759)|
| 0:29:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1761)|
| 0:29:24| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1764)|
| 0:29:25| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1765)|
| 0:29:27| I told someone the other day, they asked me what I was doing now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1767)|
| 0:29:31| and I said, whatever my wife tells me to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1771)|
| 0:29:38| Are there any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1778)|
| 0:29:39| I have a couple of quick ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1779)|
| 0:29:40| With PBA, did you work with the budget at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1780)|
| 0:29:43| Oh, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1783)|
| 0:29:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1784)|
| 0:29:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1785)|
| 0:29:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1786)|
| 0:29:47| Our budget was, of course, there was a piece of the city budget in there with regards to World's Fair Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1787)|
| 0:29:52| and volunteer landing and the city county building, but it was upwards of $10 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1792)|
| 0:29:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1798)|
| 0:29:59| And same question about the skate park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1799)|
| 0:30:01| I know you're really big on youth recreation and organized sports like baseball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1801)|
| 0:30:07| How do you feel about skate parks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1807)|
| 0:30:10| Greg, I drive by the new Powell Spray Park four or five times a week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1810)|
| 0:30:18| and usually one of those times I see the kids out there skating on the new seats and the new benches,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1818)|
| 0:30:24| and they do that because they don't have any other place to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1824)|
| 0:30:28| And if we've got the money and we've got the land near or adjacent to that spray park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1828)|
| 0:30:36| then I would be in total favor of doing something like that for that recreational activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1836)|
| 0:30:42| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1842)|
| 0:30:43| There's an old saying, if your community doesn't have a skate park, your community becomes a skate park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1843)|
| 0:30:49| That's about the truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1849)|
| 0:30:54| Are there any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1854)|
| 0:30:56| I appreciate you stepping up and trying to be a point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1856)|
| 0:30:59| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1859)|
| 0:31:00| And thank you all for allowing me to speak to you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1860)|
| 0:31:03| I really appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1863)|
| 0:31:04| Thank you, Mr. Browntree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1864)|
| 0:31:06| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1866)|
| 0:31:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1867)|
| 0:31:09| Bob, the question about the scenic drive, when Bob was talking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1869)|
| 0:31:14| it sort of sparked something in me to ask him that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1874)|
| 0:31:18| I think it would be fair for me to ask that of Mr. Cain if that would be all right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1878)|
| 0:31:22| if I could just broaden forward and ask him that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1882)|
| 0:31:29| Roger, I guess you heard the question about making,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1889)|
| 0:31:32| there is a movement to make Hardin Valley Road a scenic drive, which would prevent billboards on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1892)|
| 0:31:38| Would you be in favor of making it a scenic drive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1898)|
| 0:31:41| Well, I'd have to look at it, but it sounds like it would be a good proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1901)|
| 0:31:45| I mean, it's a beautiful rural area that needs to be preserved in its state as much as it can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1905)|
| 0:31:51| but it would just really depend on what it came out to be as far as the proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1911)|
| 0:31:55| But, yeah, it sounds very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1915)|
| 0:31:57| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1917)|
| 0:32:01| Thank you, Mr. Cain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1921)|
| 0:32:04| We're going to move along to the 8th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1924)|
| 0:32:08| Public comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1928)|
| 0:32:09| Oh, you forgot public comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1929)|
| 0:32:11| Two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1931)|
| 0:32:14| I'm trying to move this meeting along faster than what I should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1934)|
| 0:32:20| Smith's got a ballgame to get to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1940)|
| 0:32:22| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1942)|
| 0:32:23| I'm coaching tonight, so I'm going to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1943)|
| 0:32:25| We're going to put the blame on you if we don't come through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1945)|
| 0:32:27| Well, we're winning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1947)|
| 0:32:28| Larry, if you're here, they might win.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1948)|
| 0:32:32| Thank you for recognizing me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1952)|
| 0:32:35| I'm Irving Williams, and I've lived in the 6th District for over 30 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1955)|
| 0:32:41| and I've known Bob Browntree for at least 20 of those years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1961)|
| 0:32:47| And I have known him to be a very dependable person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1967)|
| 0:32:52| He's also a person that you can trust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1972)|
| 0:32:56| He is also a good communicator, and if Bob tells you he's going to do something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1976)|
| 0:33:02| he's going to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1982)|
| 0:33:05| We need a person like Bob Browntree to represent the 6th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1985)|
| 0:33:13| And I'm saying this from the bottom of my heart because I've known Bob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1993)|
| 0:33:17| I worked with him at TVA when he was a public safety officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=1997)|
| 0:33:23| and I was in dam safety at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2003)|
| 0:33:26| And Bob is good talking with people and communicating with people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2006)|
| 0:33:32| And I think that he would take the people in the 6th District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2012)|
| 0:33:36| and ask them what their concerns are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2016)|
| 0:33:40| and he would come back to this commission and represent them in a fine manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2020)|
| 0:33:47| Thank you for giving me this opportunity to speak for Bob Browntree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2027)|
| 0:33:51| and I hope you would select him as the representative for the 6th District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2031)|
| 0:33:57| because he will represent all the people in the 6th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2037)|
| 0:34:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2040)|
| 0:34:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2041)|
| 0:34:03| Is there anyone else that would like to speak on the 6th District?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2043)|
| 0:34:09| If not, we're moving on to the 8th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2049)|
| 0:34:11| We have four candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2051)|
| 0:34:14| First, Mr. James Boyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2054)|
| 0:34:26| Thank you, Mr. Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2066)|
| 0:34:28| I've been a resident of East Knox County in the 6th District for 60-plus years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2068)|
| 0:34:34| I hate to admit that in a way, but I'm glad of it, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2074)|
| 0:34:39| I've seen the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2079)|
| 0:34:42| and the surrounding parts of the community grow, evolve into what they are now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2082)|
| 0:34:47| I have lived there, like I say, for 60-some odd years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2087)|
| 0:34:50| Family, complete all my family is in that district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2090)|
| 0:34:54| And so it's of great interest to me what happens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2094)|
| 0:34:57| and what goes on within the confines of that district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2097)|
| 0:35:03| I graduated from Carter High School in 1957, joined the Air Force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2103)|
| 0:35:07| spent four years in the Air Force, received an honorable discharge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2107)|
| 0:35:13| was sent to the University of Syracuse to a Russian language school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2113)|
| 0:35:17| when I was in the Air Force, came out of the Air Force, went to work for TVA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2117)|
| 0:35:22| got a degree in civil engineering, spent 16 years either as a structural steel civil engineer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2122)|
| 0:35:29| in structural design and or in land administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2129)|
| 0:35:34| moved to the point where when I left TVA I was what they call 26A coordinator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2134)|
| 0:35:41| which doesn't mean anything to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2141)|
| 0:35:43| It's the job that coordinates between the Corps of Engineers, TVA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2143)|
| 0:35:50| and local issues for permits and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2150)|
| 0:35:57| At that point in time, when I left TVA, I went into private practice as a land surveyor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2157)|
| 0:36:03| I have a business of my own, Boyer Surveying Company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2163)|
| 0:36:06| I've spent 30 plus years in land surveying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2166)|
| 0:36:11| and knowing the business community in the Eighth District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2171)|
| 0:36:18| I'm talking about six districts long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2178)|
| 0:36:20| I've moved to the Sixth District, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2180)|
| 0:36:24| That's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2184)|
| 0:36:25| I'd come over, Mr. Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2185)|
| 0:36:27| You all have a good district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2187)|
| 0:36:30| But spent some 30 years as a land surveyor in private practice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2190)|
| 0:36:36| and during that time ran for elective office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2196)|
| 0:36:40| and was elected to five successive terms in the State House of Representatives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2200)|
| 0:36:45| a total of 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2205)|
| 0:36:47| The last four years of that I served as House Republican Caucus Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2207)|
| 0:36:53| I am married, and if we make it to April the 21st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2213)|
| 0:36:59| my lovely bride will have shared 50 years with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2219)|
| 0:37:03| So I count that as a blessing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2223)|
| 0:37:05| and something that's not the least of my qualifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2225)|
| 0:37:10| to have negotiated 50 years of marriage with the same woman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2230)|
| 0:37:14| I've got three children, three sons, eight grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2234)|
| 0:37:22| My youngest son is a chaplain in the U.S. Air Force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2242)|
| 0:37:25| and is currently stationed in England.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2245)|
| 0:37:29| When this opportunity opened up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2249)|
| 0:37:31| I have been in civic and community affairs for 40-plus years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2251)|
| 0:37:36| I have been part of every civic organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2256)|
| 0:37:39| or an officer in every civic organization in the East End of the Eighth District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2259)|
| 0:37:47| One of the things I'm really proud of is I was the last PTA president at the old Skaggson School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2267)|
| 0:37:53| and the first PTA president at East Knox County Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2273)|
| 0:37:58| I have participated in all other civic organizations within that area of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2278)|
| 0:38:08| Like I said, I will quit at that point and allow you to quit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2288)|
| 0:38:17| Jim, I don't think we need to ask you about budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2297)|
| 0:38:22| You've been working with the state as much as you have with the states.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2302)|
| 0:38:25| When I was House Caucus Chairman, I sat on the Finance Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2305)|
| 0:38:29| and you just add several more zeros to the Knox County budget, and that's what we dealt with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2309)|
| 0:38:37| We have a question about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2317)|
| 0:38:41| Jim, I appreciate you being here and coming up tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2321)|
| 0:38:45| Two questions that I'll probably ask every candidate in my district here is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2325)|
| 0:38:50| one, what would you like to see? You know our needs and stuff out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2330)|
| 0:38:54| Two, the District 8 is a little bit in a unique position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2334)|
| 0:38:58| in that the winner of the election does not have any opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2338)|
| 0:39:06| We hear about caretakers and stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2346)|
| 0:39:09| So first, or take it any order that you would like, is what would you like to see?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2349)|
| 0:39:15| And then second, since in a ----| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2355)|
| 0:39:19| Let me address the caretaker kind of concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2359)|
| 0:39:21| And in a sense, that's really what we are talking about to some degree, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2361)|
| 0:39:28| My thought was, like I say, I have been in public service the biggest part of my life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2368)|
| 0:39:33| off and on in one form or another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2373)|
| 0:39:35| I see this as another opportunity to be part of public service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2375)|
| 0:39:39| And what I would probably, one of the questions that's going to get asked in a minute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2379)|
| 0:39:43| but I can answer it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2383)|
| 0:39:45| One of the things I would like to see happen is that the citizens of that district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2385)|
| 0:39:49| that we preserve all the rights that they have now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2389)|
| 0:39:52| and we protect all the interests that they have now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2392)|
| 0:39:55| that when that time period is over and the duly elected commissioner is sworn into office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2395)|
| 0:40:02| that those people will be at least as well off as they were today and hopefully better off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2402)|
| 0:40:09| As far as, you know, objectives on what's going to happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2409)|
| 0:40:13| you're as aware as I am that the 6th District is getting a lot of new growth and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2413)|
| 0:40:20| but the 8th District is getting a tremendous amount of growth, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2420)|
| 0:40:23| And the little comment that was made a while ago is probably not far off base,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2423)|
| 0:40:27| that every farmer that dies, there's two subdivisions that spring up over his grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2427)|
| 0:40:34| As the sewers continue to extend and the young people that inherit that property when their families are gone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2434)|
| 0:40:43| it's not unreasonable to expect them to develop it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2443)|
| 0:40:46| I mean, they're going to develop it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2446)|
| 0:40:48| It is unreasonable to not expect the other members in the community to have some say so in that, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2448)|
| 0:40:56| And so there is a fine balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2456)|
| 0:40:58| And, you know, I've worked with bipartisan issues in the legislature and at the local level both,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2458)|
| 0:41:04| trying to bring groups together to some median point that is probably in the best interest of both sides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2464)|
| 0:41:13| when you get right down to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2473)|
| 0:41:15| And I think that can be done in land use development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2475)|
| 0:41:17| I think we have the ability to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2477)|
| 0:41:19| I fought the rapid annexation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2479)|
| 0:41:25| that some previous city administrations had carried on in this county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2485)|
| 0:41:30| and did the best I could to change some of that and was successful in changing it to some degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2490)|
| 0:41:36| So, you know, the land use is not a thing that's just totally overriding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2496)|
| 0:41:43| and something that cannot be dealt with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2503)|
| 0:41:46| But it is something that we need to address in a very logical manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2506)|
| 0:41:51| We need to address it in a way that there is going to be some development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2511)|
| 0:41:55| I don't think we can avoid that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2515)|
| 0:41:57| I don't think there's any way to avoid some development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2517)|
| 0:41:59| But the development should not hamper or harm the rest of the citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2519)|
| 0:42:04| nor should it hamper or harm those that are trying to develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2524)|
| 0:42:07| I think they have a right to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2527)|
| 0:42:09| It's their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2529)|
| 0:42:10| They have certain rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2530)|
| 0:42:12| The community, though, also has certain rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2532)|
| 0:42:14| And we have to come to that real balance of dealing with those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2534)|
| 0:42:18| And that's probably the most difficult issue that I see this county dealing with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2538)|
| 0:42:22| except maybe for the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2542)|
| 0:42:25| In that regard, the community involvement in development decisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2545)|
| 0:42:33| would you regard what has happened with regard to the Midway Road project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2553)|
| 0:42:37| to have met your standards as to community involvement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2557)|
| 0:42:42| There is, when you say meet my standards, I really don't want it to be my standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2562)|
| 0:42:47| I want it to be the community standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2567)|
| 0:42:50| At this point, there's a great deal of division between the two groups dealing with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2570)|
| 0:42:56| where I think still division between them as to whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2576)|
| 0:42:59| or not they have had resolvement on both sides of that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2579)|
| 0:43:05| I'm not sure that either side is satisfied even at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2585)|
| 0:43:14| And so, you know, to tell you that they've met the standards that would be set for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2594)|
| 0:43:19| Mr. Horne, I can't really answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2599)|
| 0:43:30| Any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2610)|
| 0:43:31| I have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2611)|
| 0:43:32| Mr. Boyer, I really like your presentation tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2612)|
| 0:43:38| One thing, since there isn't a Democrat running for this seat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2618)|
| 0:43:42| I am probably going to be more inclined to support Mr. Wright simply because, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2622)|
| 0:43:49| his race is over since there's nobody else on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2629)|
| 0:43:53| If you're not chosen for this, would you consider reapplying in a few months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2633)|
| 0:43:58| Because I think in a few months we may be electing a tax assessor out of your district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2638)|
| 0:44:05| Would you consider reapplying at that time for another open seat that I think we Republicans are going to create?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2645)|
| 0:44:12| Let me be very honest with you, Mr. Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2652)|
| 0:44:14| I enjoy the life that my wife and I get to lead right now because we are not hamstrung by being tied down too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2654)|
| 0:44:25| So in the short term, yes, I would be more than glad to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2665)|
| 0:44:29| Long term, for something else, I will never say never.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2669)|
| 0:44:33| That's one piece of wisdom that I have learned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2673)|
| 0:44:35| I never say never.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2675)|
| 0:44:36| Well, that would actually be two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2676)|
| 0:44:38| Will there be two years left on the time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2678)|
| 0:44:43| Like I say, I never say never.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2683)|
| 0:44:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2685)|
| 0:44:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2686)|
| 0:44:52| Since everybody else is getting asked about TIFs and how would you take a look at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2692)|
| 0:45:00| and what do you think the important issues are concerning TIFs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2700)|
| 0:45:05| and how do you come up with a final decision on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2705)|
| 0:45:08| Well, we dealt with it quite a bit at the state level in the first place over the years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2708)|
| 0:45:13| and that's kind of where it came from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2713)|
| 0:45:15| Obviously, that's where it came from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2715)|
| 0:45:18| And the concept, as I understand the concept, I mean from my viewpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2718)|
| 0:45:23| the concept is you're trying to fairly balance taxation with spending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2723)|
| 0:45:30| is really the nutshell of the issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2730)|
| 0:45:33| because those groups that you're trying to aid in some way or abet in some way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2733)|
| 0:45:39| should in return bring back into the community either additional revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2739)|
| 0:45:44| or additional assets of some kind by being able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2744)|
| 0:45:48| And, of course, a prime example that basically we started out with in legislature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2748)|
| 0:45:52| was Super Bowl and Pigeon Forge in that we granted use of a change in the tax structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2752)|
| 0:46:01| so that the revenue they generated could be put back into the uses up there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2761)|
| 0:46:06| that generate more revenue for the whole state long term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2766)|
| 0:46:10| and can be divided up among the other units in the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2770)|
| 0:46:13| And I kind of see the TIPS idea being somewhat to that same degree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2773)|
| 0:46:19| in that it should be beneficial not just to that group that you're trying to aid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2779)|
| 0:46:23| but it also should be beneficial to the rest of the community at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2783)|
| 0:46:31| I've known Mr. Boyer and his family for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2791)|
| 0:46:33| I don't think I even need to ask this question, but I'll be consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2793)|
| 0:46:36| Would you wait to be sworn in or would you want to be sworn in immediately?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2796)|
| 0:46:39| I would wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2799)|
| 0:46:40| So, be it the will of this committee, if I were selected to be appointed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2800)|
| 0:46:44| I'd be at the will of this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2804)|
| 0:46:51| Are there any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2811)|
| 0:46:54| Thank you, Mr. Boyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2814)|
| 0:46:55| I certainly appreciate the opportunity to be here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2815)|
| 0:46:58| and I really want you to know that I would enjoy serving given that opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2818)|
| 0:47:04| and feel like it could make a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2824)|
| 0:47:06| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2826)|

| 0:47:49| I live at 7322 Ridgeview Road, Coryton, Tennessee, 37721.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2869)|
| 0:47:56| I'd first and foremost like to thank the Knox County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2876)|
| 0:48:00| for this opportunity to express my interest in representing the 8th District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2880)|
| 0:48:04| and the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2884)|
| 0:48:07| My belief is trust in our government is the foremost cornerstone of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2887)|
| 0:48:15| Over the last year, some of this trust has been lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2895)|
| 0:48:19| I am a registered Republican,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2899)|
| 0:48:21| and at my next birthday I'll be 50 years old, if the Lord willing, in June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2901)|
| 0:48:27| Providing this service is one of the foremost opportunities I feel that we can do for our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2907)|
| 0:48:35| Proudly, I'd like to say that I am a product of the Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2915)|
| 0:48:39| and the state of Tennessee educational system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2919)|
| 0:48:42| I was born here in Knox County, went to Fulton High School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2922)|
| 0:48:45| graduated from the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2925)|
| 0:48:50| The degrees that I earned at the University of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2930)|
| 0:48:52| I have many people to thank and many businesses in this area to thank as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2932)|
| 0:48:57| While I was in college, I worked at the UPS and St. Mary's Medical Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2937)|
| 0:49:03| These people actually gave me the opportunity to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2943)|
| 0:49:06| and still get my education at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=2946)|

| 0:52:20| Mr. Wright is a very viable candidate and has done an excellent job in his campaign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3140)|
| 0:52:26| but there were 3,100 votes that were opposed to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3146)|
| 0:52:32| Not that that's anything that's pertinent, but it is more than he received votes that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3152)|
| 0:52:41| During the election, I have stayed completely neutral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3161)|
| 0:52:45| I stayed completely neutral during this election so as this opportunity would be here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3165)|
| 0:52:49| that I could stand before you tonight and say I supported no one during the election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3169)|
| 0:52:55| I have no one backing me right now for this position except for my pure desire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3175)|
| 0:53:01| of wanting to put respectability back into the office and the position in the 8th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3181)|
| 0:53:07| Jim Boyer and I have known each other since I was 20 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3187)|
| 0:53:11| I went to church with him before for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3191)|
| 0:53:16| I feel like that my representation of myself would be forthright,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3196)|
| 0:53:24| would be upfront and honest with the citizens in the 8th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3204)|
| 0:53:30| Going forward, what would I like to accomplish during my time period?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3210)|
| 0:53:34| I'd like for the citizens to feel like that they have been represented well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3214)|
| 0:53:39| fairly, openly, and honestly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3219)|
| 0:53:45| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3225)|
| 0:53:47| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3227)|
| 0:53:49| I have a few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3229)|
| 0:53:50| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3230)|
| 0:53:53| Tom, I appreciate you being here tonight and stepping up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3233)|
| 0:53:57| It's hard to come forward sometimes and take questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3237)|
| 0:54:01| I just appreciate you for doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3241)|
| 0:54:03| A couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3243)|
| 0:54:04| A lot of people don't realize the size of the 8th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3244)|
| 0:54:07| We have 10 schools, one of the largest land mass, rapid development, and all like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3247)|
| 0:54:14| One, I'd be interested in what, during this interim period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3254)|
| 0:54:19| that you would like to accomplish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3259)|
| 0:54:21| I know the needs out there, but it is such a large district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3261)|
| 0:54:24| Two is that you work in the private sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3264)|
| 0:54:29| I notice here on your resume that you're in Louisville, Tennessee, which is Blount County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3269)|
| 0:54:35| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3275)|
| 0:54:36| We're right at the corner of Blount County Topside Road and Pellissippi Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3276)|
| 0:54:39| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3279)|
| 0:54:41| Would that be a hindrance for the flexibility and stuff that you might need to bring to this district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3281)|
| 0:54:47| I've actually had a discussion with my employer with this entire concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3287)|
| 0:54:52| They have been extremely international, moved here in the year 2000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3292)|
| 0:54:58| We may have a discussion in a few minutes a little bit about TIFs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3298)|
| 0:55:02| From the standpoint that they are supporting me fully in my effort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3302)|
| 0:55:07| they understand my personal reasons for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3307)|
| 0:55:11| They also understand that they have to be a good corporate citizen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3311)|
| 0:55:15| to the community of all Blount County and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3315)|
| 0:55:20| Every day I take the trek across town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3320)|
| 0:55:23| I travel around 640, 275, Interstate 40, Alcoa Highway, Topside Road every single day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3323)|
| 0:55:31| I think that gives me a good view of actually what's going on in the other areas of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3331)|
| 0:55:36| Geographically, the 8th District is a very large district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3336)|
| 0:55:40| It's very diverse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3340)|
| 0:55:42| It has many different issues from the Midway Road, as we talked about a little bit earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3342)|
| 0:55:50| infrastructure issues, land use issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3350)|
| 0:55:55| All of those things won't be solved in the next six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3355)|
| 0:55:59| It may not be solved in the next six years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3359)|
| 0:56:02| But by giving the citizens of that district a sincere effort and listening ear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3362)|
| 0:56:11| that's what people want to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3371)|
| 0:56:13| They don't want to hear lip service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3373)|
| 0:56:15| They don't want you just passing over their thoughts and their ideals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3375)|
| 0:56:18| They want you to listen to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3378)|
| 0:56:21| I can do that very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3381)|
| 0:56:23| That's what I have to do every single day with my work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3383)|
| 0:56:25| and it's the same thing I can do every single evening with my children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3385)|
| 0:56:29| or every single evening with the citizens of my community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3389)|
| 0:56:33| So have you identified any special project or anything that you would like to work on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3393)|
| 0:56:38| I have not identified any special project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3398)|
| 0:56:40| I'd like to first have the opportunity to be appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3400)|
| 0:56:45| At that point in time, have a little time of having some open meetings with some of the communities, associations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3405)|
| 0:56:52| I'd like to listen to what their concerns are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3412)|
| 0:56:55| I don't want to ramrod something that I'm not certain it's needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3415)|
| 0:57:01| Caretaking is something that is going to be done with this district and all the districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3421)|
| 0:57:07| But respectability is what I'd like to bring back to the organization of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3427)|
| 0:57:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3436)|
| 0:57:18| Let me put to you the same question I put to Mr. Boyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3438)|
| 0:57:21| How would you evaluate the level of neighborhood involvement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3441)|
| 0:57:25| and respect associated with the Midway Road project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3445)|
| 0:57:32| I don't really say that I can say that it has been completely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3452)|
| 0:57:38| I'm not certain that each side has listened to the other side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3458)|
| 0:57:42| This is a very large issue that's been going on for some time now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3462)|
| 0:57:48| Like I say, you can't necessarily solve some of these issues in a six-month time frame| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3468)|
| 0:57:53| or sometimes a two- or three-year time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3473)|
| 0:57:56| I think we heard earlier about some projects that were held up for three or four years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3476)|
| 0:58:01| and this is one of those situations that may be the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3481)|
| 0:58:06| As the city expands or as the community is changing, change is not easy for people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3486)|
| 0:58:16| I do feel like I am a good agent for change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3496)|
| 0:58:19| and trying to get everyone working together during that change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3499)|
| 0:58:27| But going back to your basic question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3507)|
| 0:58:30| I'm not very certain that all sides have really listened to the other side's opinions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3510)|
| 0:58:35| and statements and processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3515)|
| 0:58:38| I think there needs to be more meetings held on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3518)|
| 0:58:51| I guess you go by Tom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3531)|
| 0:58:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3532)|
| 0:58:53| Okay, Tom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3533)|
| 0:58:54| And if you've known me for 25 years and went to high school with me, it's Tommy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3534)|
| 0:58:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3539)|
| 0:59:02| How do you feel about TIFs, and do you think that they're useful, or how can they be useful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3542)|
| 0:59:12| and in what instances do you think would you not be in favor of them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3552)|
| 0:59:22| TIFs, I definitely believe in blighted areas TIFs are warranted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3562)|
| 0:59:29| There have been several situations that Knox County has used that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3569)|
| 0:59:35| Every development project that's done by a developer should be able to stand on its own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3575)|
| 0:59:43| If a developer comes into an area, he should have a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3583)|
| 0:59:47| He should have an entrance and an exit plan in every project he ever does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3587)|
| 0:59:52| But there's always a but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3592)|
| 0:59:55| Every individual situation has to be viewed upon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3595)|
| 0:59:59| Competition is out there today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3599)|
| 1:00:03| I kind of feel that Knox County in some places has lost business because of not using some TIFs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3603)|
| 1:00:14| At the same time, I think that there has been certain situations where we may have used a TIF when unnecessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3614)|
| 1:00:22| Every project should be reviewed by the board before it comes to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3622)|
| 1:00:29| I definitely feel that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3629)|
| 1:00:31| The industrial board should be doing that evaluation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3631)|
| 1:00:33| and giving us a recommendation before we see that TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3633)|
| 1:00:39| Sometimes this body is able to get into the details they need to be into,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3639)|
| 1:00:44| and sometimes you're not given all the details that you may have overlooked or not been aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3644)|
| 1:00:51| TIFs are a thing of the day today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3651)|
| 1:00:56| Businesses are looking for those opportunities, whether it be for education, for tax diversion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3656)|
| 1:01:03| You know, they're looking for ways to make their profit quicker and sooner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3663)|
| 1:01:07| Developers are the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3667)|
| 1:01:09| We have to find out where, you know, they're asking for the dollar, but they'll take 50 cents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3669)|
| 1:01:16| You know, we've got to figure out where that line is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3676)|
| 1:01:19| We've got to be able to work with that developer and with that company to figure out just, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3679)|
| 1:01:25| how can we get your business and your company, but at the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3685)|
| 1:01:28| you've got to understand that we are responsible to the taxpayers of this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3688)|
| 1:01:37| If you were presented with a budget, and we're going to be presented with a budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3697)|
| 1:01:40| should you be appointed here in the next 90 to 120 days, would you vote for a tax increase?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3700)|
| 1:01:52| Without knowing the specifics about the budget, I can't say that I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3712)|
| 1:02:00| I'm very conservative in nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3720)|
| 1:02:02| I'm very service-oriented in nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3722)|
| 1:02:06| I do know that the citizens of Knox County are taxed, you know, in my opinion, a little high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3726)|
| 1:02:18| But what services are we providing with that tax increase?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3738)|
| 1:02:24| The first thing I'd want to look at is what do the citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3744)|
| 1:02:29| and the community that I represent feel about that tax increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3749)|
| 1:02:35| I'd want to get some input from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3755)|
| 1:02:38| Wisdom is something that my pastor tells me that you get with age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3758)|
| 1:02:43| It also is something that's not easily always kept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3763)|
| 1:02:47| You know, I want to be humble to say the fact that I don't want to do a tax increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3767)|
| 1:02:54| but I want to be wise enough to say that it may be warranted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3774)|
| 1:02:58| based on what we actually need to do in this community at this moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3778)|
| 1:03:09| Are there any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3789)|
| 1:03:13| Good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3793)|
| 1:03:15| Thank you, Tom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3795)|
| 1:03:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3796)|
| 1:03:17| Got it right, didn't I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3797)|
| 1:03:19| Yes, you did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3799)|
| 1:03:20| Thank you, gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3800)|
| 1:03:21| I do appreciate this opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3801)|
| 1:03:24| Dave Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3804)|
| 1:03:35| Mr. Chairman, commissioners, ladies and gentlemen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3815)|
| 1:03:39| my name is Dave Wright, 6930 Borough Road, Corrington, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3819)|
| 1:03:47| I'm seeking appointment to a county commission, Knox County Commission, seat 8B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3827)|
| 1:03:56| I've campaigned for this job for the last three months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3836)|
| 1:04:03| If there are things that need to be known about me, you can ask a question in a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3843)|
| 1:04:12| I have traveled from Texas Valley Road to Kodak Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3852)|
| 1:04:17| I have talked to people in various community centers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3857)|
| 1:04:20| and got a lot of input on what I think people want in the 8th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3860)|
| 1:04:32| The campaign that I was involved in had five candidates in the primary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3872)|
| 1:04:39| and I received more than 40% of the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3879)|
| 1:04:46| I will be seated on county commission because I'm unopposed in the general election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3886)|
| 1:04:52| I will be seated in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3892)|
| 1:05:00| And I offer myself to be appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3900)|
| 1:05:05| I'm seeking the appointment because I believe it will help me come online quicker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3905)|
| 1:05:10| and help the commission whenever it gets down to the other people coming on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3910)|
| 1:05:16| rather than everyone coming on at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3916)|
| 1:05:19| So it will be a learning benefit for me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3919)|
| 1:05:22| and I am asked by almost everyone that I pass if I'm seeking the appointment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3922)|
| 1:05:30| and I've got good acceptance of me seeking the appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3930)|
| 1:05:34| And having said that, more questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3934)|
| 1:05:38| We've got a basketball game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3938)|
| 1:05:39| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3939)|
| 1:05:42| Who wants to start?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3942)|
| 1:05:44| I will, and I'm actually going to make more of a comment than a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3944)|
| 1:05:49| You know, I'm supporting you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3949)|
| 1:05:51| I feel like you've won.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3951)|
| 1:05:53| You don't have an opponent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3953)|
| 1:05:55| And I also think it's extremely important in your case in particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3955)|
| 1:06:00| because there's an extremely good chance that the Republican Party is going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3960)|
| 1:06:03| or the voters are going to elect your seatmate to the tax assessor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3963)|
| 1:06:11| So I think it would be very beneficial for Knox County for you to go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3971)|
| 1:06:16| and be seated now because in just a few months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3976)|
| 1:06:20| I believe you're going to be the senior commissioner in your district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3980)|
| 1:06:24| And so I just wanted to comment, nothing against the other folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3984)|
| 1:06:27| but congratulations on your race, and I think you've won.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3987)|
| 1:06:34| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3994)|
| 1:06:36| As you were going around and talking with people in the campaign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3996)|
| 1:06:39| what did they tell you their issues were?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=3999)|
| 1:06:43| What did they say if you are elected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4003)|
| 1:06:46| and if you serve through the appointment process and whatnot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4006)|
| 1:06:49| that they would like to see you accomplish?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4009)|
| 1:06:52| Most of the things that people have remarked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4012)|
| 1:06:55| deal with probably what's the largest budgetary item, and that's schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4015)|
| 1:07:02| You go to the Carter community and people talk about the elementary school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4022)|
| 1:07:08| probably the oldest physical plant in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4028)|
| 1:07:12| And over in the Gibbs area, they talk about the nonexistent middle school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4032)|
| 1:07:21| Now, I realize county commission is not in the business of schools per se| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4041)|
| 1:07:25| because that's what the school board is about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4045)|
| 1:07:27| but that's a couple of things that I've heard traveling across the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4047)|
| 1:07:34| I would take the swearing in whenever the swearing in is scheduled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4054)|
| 1:07:41| Let me know in advance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4061)|
| 1:07:42| I'd like to have my mom and dad there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4062)|
| 1:07:46| I suppose the answer to that is whether you mean 2 p.m. or September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4066)|
| 1:07:52| So let me ask the same question about what you're hearing from the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4072)|
| 1:07:57| about Midway and how the neighborhood was treated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4077)|
| 1:08:02| If you get out in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4082)|
| 1:08:04| you hear the community saying they were not treated very well, not enough input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4084)|
| 1:08:10| Now, that's not to say what the outcome should be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4090)|
| 1:08:12| but that's to say what you hear in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4092)|
| 1:08:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4097)|
| 1:08:20| Dave, I want to comment on your campaign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4100)|
| 1:08:24| You had a five-person race and you came out with over 40%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4104)|
| 1:08:27| I can feel with you the same way in my race.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4107)|
| 1:08:29| I had five people and got over 40%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4109)|
| 1:08:32| And I tend to agree with Commissioner Lambert exactly with what he said there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4112)|
| 1:08:37| and what you have said about coming on and doing early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4117)|
| 1:08:41| And the two people that have come up tonight are great individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4121)|
| 1:08:45| Former Representative Boyer, I know him really well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4125)|
| 1:08:47| Thank the world of Jim Boyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4127)|
| 1:08:49| And Mr. Tomlin first met him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4129)|
| 1:08:51| He seemed like a great individual too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4131)|
| 1:08:53| But I think that I'm leading that way, that you have earned it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4133)|
| 1:08:59| You've been out there working for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4139)|
| 1:09:01| And I can't wait to have you sit up there with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4141)|
| 1:09:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4144)|
| 1:09:07| Are there any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4147)|
| 1:09:09| Seeing none, thank you, Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4149)|
| 1:09:11| I appreciate this opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4151)|
| 1:09:17| Is there anyone from the 8th District that would like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4157)|
| 1:09:23| Seeing none, we'll move on to the 9th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4163)|
| 1:09:27| I'd like to tell you also that Kendall G. Wells will be interviewing Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4167)|
| 1:09:35| She couldn't come from the 2nd District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4175)|
| 1:09:39| Before we start on the 9th District candidates, I'd like to read a letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4179)|
| 1:09:42| Members of County Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4182)|
| 1:09:44| I regret that I am unable to be there tonight for your interview session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4184)|
| 1:09:50| I have had a prior commitment for months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4190)|
| 1:09:53| Frankly, I did not want the interim appointment to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4193)|
| 1:09:57| I only submitted my name after my opponent asked that he be chosen to fill the vacant 9A seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4197)|
| 1:10:03| I sincerely believe that you will be given an unfair advantage to a candidate by naming either of us to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4203)|
| 1:10:10| A caretaker seems to be a fair solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4210)|
| 1:10:14| If Mike Brown withdraws his name for consideration, I will withdraw mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4214)|
| 1:10:19| Again, let me remind you I received the most votes in the past election for seat 9A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4219)|
| 1:10:25| Chairman Strickland, please have this letter read in the record at the appropriate time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4225)|
| 1:10:31| Sincerely, Vernon Rose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4231)|
| 1:10:33| Vernon Rose has withdrawn his name and Mike Brown has also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4233)|
| 1:10:40| So to start the 9th District, Victoria DeFreeze.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4240)|
| 1:10:54| Thank you for having us here this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4254)|
| 1:10:58| Actually, for seat 9A, it's no longer worthy of discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4258)|
| 1:11:03| We do need a caretaker now for this seat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4263)|
| 1:11:06| because the candidates do need a fair race for the August election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4266)|
| 1:11:10| People have asked, why would you consider yourself a qualified candidate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4270)|
| 1:11:15| a qualified applicant to be a caretaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4275)|
| 1:11:18| And I just have had an experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4278)|
| 1:11:22| I have always learned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4282)|
| 1:11:24| I've been trained to learn by doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4284)|
| 1:11:26| I was given a golden opportunity in my youth to serve on some mission trips to some places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4286)|
| 1:11:31| such as Panama, Costa Rica, Portugal, Scotland, some inner cities in Hartford, Connecticut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4291)|
| 1:11:36| also New York City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4296)|
| 1:11:38| As a young person, I witnessed the political turmoil and political unrest that was done to Panama.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4298)|
| 1:11:45| I visited that country shortly after the Noriega regime had fallen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4305)|
| 1:11:51| and the political climate made it a bit dangerous for us to be in the capital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4311)|
| 1:11:55| I remember sitting and crouching down with a group that I was with in the bottom of a school bus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4315)|
| 1:12:01| and we were surrounded by the natives who were trying to protect us from being seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4321)|
| 1:12:06| That was the first time that I had ever had to think about personal safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4326)|
| 1:12:11| and hide on account of my nationality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4331)|
| 1:12:14| Fortunately, that summer I worked in very remote areas of Panama and Costa Rica,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4334)|
| 1:12:19| and this experience was the closest encounter that I had had with the negative results of dictatorship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4339)|
| 1:12:25| I also had to help arbitrate with international custom offices to get much-needed supplies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4345)|
| 1:12:30| into some of these areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4350)|
| 1:12:32| We had to collaborate with American embassies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4352)|
| 1:12:34| and I learned really quick that you need to ally close to the American embassies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4354)|
| 1:12:40| I also had to learn quickly the customs and the practices of the people of those various places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4360)|
| 1:12:46| so that I would not offend the people and that my message would be delivered with integrity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4366)|
| 1:12:51| I had to learn quickly and apply what I had learned to communicate with the people that I was with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4371)|
| 1:12:56| and through these excursions I have seen needs, desperation, and poverty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4376)|
| 1:13:02| but not only in faraway places, also in our own country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4382)|
| 1:13:06| I've seen foreigners and Americans alike yearn for life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4386)|
| 1:13:12| even though these three aspects are listed as unalienable rights of man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4392)|
| 1:13:17| These multicultural experiences set the framework for my global vision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4397)|
| 1:13:21| and these experiences helped me understand that I am a very minute part in the workings of this world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4401)|
| 1:13:28| Included in my resume you will see the wide variety of schools in the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4408)|
| 1:13:31| where I have spent a number of hours in field work over a period of six years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4411)|
| 1:13:36| and through my professional training I learned to value and appreciate the theories,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4416)|
| 1:13:40| the philosophies, the research, and publications that the academic world produced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4420)|
| 1:13:45| However, I also learned that you must discern professional advice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4425)|
| 1:13:48| for it does not always work as expected in application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4428)|
| 1:13:52| I worked for Knox County Schools as an instructor for talented and gifted children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4432)|
| 1:13:57| I have worked as a satellite program instructor in West Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4437)|
| 1:14:00| for those who desired a blend of homeschooling and traditional school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4440)|
| 1:14:05| and since 2000 I have been an educator in private practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4445)|
| 1:14:09| I consider myself a lifelong learner and encourage the students that I work with to be the same,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4449)|
| 1:14:14| for life is a voyage for discovery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4454)|
| 1:14:18| For a short while between 2005 and 2006 I served on the Knox County Library Board of Trustees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4458)|
| 1:14:23| which unfortunately was reduced to the status of Knox County Library Advisory Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4463)|
| 1:14:29| As a lifelong learner I spend quite a bit of time in the libraries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4469)|
| 1:14:33| however I had to be a quick study on library governance issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4473)|
| 1:14:38| I collaborated with the state librarian, other state officials, other state librarians,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4478)|
| 1:14:44| the board, the people in the community, local officials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4484)|
| 1:14:47| on trying to maintain the library board of trustees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4487)|
| 1:14:51| Through this experience I learned that it is incredibly difficult to communicate to people in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4491)|
| 1:14:56| that their rights are being slowly trimmed away, even by our own local government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4496)|
| 1:15:02| I have been engaged in my community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4502)|
| 1:15:04| I started attending the South Delaware Area Homeowners Association in 2002,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4504)|
| 1:15:09| and I currently serve as president.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4509)|
| 1:15:11| I appreciate the gifts and the qualities of the people in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4511)|
| 1:15:15| and I try to encourage those people to use those gifts to serve their community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4515)|
| 1:15:19| I have helped assemble single-issued initiative groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4519)|
| 1:15:22| I have helped organize a couple of candidate meet and greets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4522)|
| 1:15:25| I have helped plan an arts and crafts show at the John Sevier Home that was attended by 600 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4525)|
| 1:15:31| I am passionate about listening and learning about the concerns of the people of South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4531)|
| 1:15:36| I have been married to a very encouraging and supportive husband for 15 years, Donald DeFreece,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4536)|
| 1:15:41| and have a beautiful family consisting of four children that I homeschool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4541)|
| 1:15:46| They have been a great joy and a great challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4546)|
| 1:15:50| I have learned a great deal about life by being a mother.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4550)|
| 1:15:54| I hope that our children, all of our children, will grow up in this county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4554)|
| 1:15:58| and be proud of its reputation and its integrity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4558)|
| 1:16:02| I have high hopes that Knox County will rise above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4562)|
| 1:16:06| It was asked of me recently, so how does one so involved in education get involved in politics?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4566)|
| 1:16:11| My answer, if ordinary people do not get involved in the political affairs of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4571)|
| 1:16:18| and other levels of government, it will be the demise of us all and the downfall of our democracy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4578)|
| 1:16:24| I am prepared to serve as caretaker for County Commission District Seat 9A| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4584)|
| 1:16:28| until the general election should you grant me the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4588)|
| 1:16:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4592)|
| 1:16:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4593)|
| 1:16:35| Commissioners, who wants to start?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4595)|
| 1:16:39| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4599)|
| 1:16:40| Victoria, this is a question I'm going to ask every candidate here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4600)|
| 1:16:45| To my knowledge, Knox County has only granted one TIF in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4605)|
| 1:16:52| and that was at the South Grove Shopping Center over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4612)|
| 1:16:56| Do you think that that TIF, now TIFs are set up for infrastructure and blighted areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4616)|
| 1:17:03| Do you think that that TIF has any way helped the community of South Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4623)|
| 1:17:09| In South Knoxville, I believe that has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4629)|
| 1:17:11| That intersection was really terrible, but now we have red lights there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4631)|
| 1:17:14| and that was a blighted area, and it has stimulated a lot of economic growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4634)|
| 1:17:20| And I know that a lot of the people in the community have really enjoyed having those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4640)|
| 1:17:25| that infrastructure provided there at the intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4645)|
| 1:17:27| and the availability of that development has been an encouraging thing in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4647)|
| 1:17:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4652)|
| 1:17:33| Another question I have to ask you, the budget seems to be a big issue too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4653)|
| 1:17:37| Each department of the Knox County government turns their budget in to the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4657)|
| 1:17:43| It takes them a while to get that together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4663)|
| 1:17:46| The mayor scrutinizes it, then he brings it to county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4666)|
| 1:17:50| We have approximately one month to digest this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4670)|
| 1:17:53| Do you have any solutions to how we might do a better job at this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4673)|
| 1:17:59| I think that for a budget of that size, it probably best to break it into subparts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4679)|
| 1:18:04| and have different committees and different members of the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4684)|
| 1:18:08| to review those different sections of that budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4688)|
| 1:18:11| I also think that it would be a good idea to have the submitted budget posted online| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4691)|
| 1:18:15| because we have a lot of CPAs and accountants who live in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4695)|
| 1:18:19| who would like to know what's going on with their tax dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4699)|
| 1:18:22| And I'm sure that they would be very eager to share their thoughts and views| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4702)|
| 1:18:27| to members on county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4707)|
| 1:18:29| What, if any, would be your main interest on commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4709)|
| 1:18:32| and where do you feel you could do the most for your community at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4712)|
| 1:18:36| I really believe that I would listen to the constituents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4716)|
| 1:18:39| and I would like to work with this body on anything on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4719)|
| 1:18:43| But I really think that listening to the people in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4723)|
| 1:18:47| would probably be one of my gifts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4727)|
| 1:18:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4730)|
| 1:18:54| Victoria, I remember you coming before us a couple months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4734)|
| 1:18:59| You did a really good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4739)|
| 1:19:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4740)|
| 1:19:01| I went out and congratulated you after the meeting there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4741)|
| 1:19:03| You all were really well organized, did a great thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4743)|
| 1:19:07| A couple things real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4747)|
| 1:19:08| Do you have any conflict of interest that you know of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4748)|
| 1:19:11| No, I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4751)|
| 1:19:12| My husband works for the federal government and I tutor a little bit on the side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4752)|
| 1:19:15| but I predominantly homeschool my children and do volunteer service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4755)|
| 1:19:19| And you mentioned that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4759)|
| 1:19:21| What about time there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4761)|
| 1:19:23| Do you have time to do things at 10 o'clock in the morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4763)|
| 1:19:26| or 3 o'clock in the afternoon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4766)|
| 1:19:27| Can you adjust your schedule to make it so?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4767)|
| 1:19:29| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4769)|
| 1:19:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4770)|
| 1:19:31| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4771)|
| 1:19:34| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4774)|
| 1:19:35| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4775)|
| 1:19:38| Victoria, as far as land use issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4778)|
| 1:19:41| I probably have an idea of where you fall because you've been before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4781)|
| 1:19:46| But just so that the public would know, if you were on this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4786)|
| 1:19:52| how would you view land use issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4792)|
| 1:19:55| especially when there's maybe some concerns out there in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4795)|
| 1:20:00| versus the rights of a landowner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4800)|
| 1:20:04| I agree with Lumpy Lambert on the rights of a property owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4804)|
| 1:20:09| but I don't believe that it should infringe on the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4809)|
| 1:20:13| I really believe and firmly believe, as you have heard me say before, about the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4813)|
| 1:20:17| I stand behind that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4817)|
| 1:20:19| I think that's a great plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4819)|
| 1:20:20| I don't think that's something that you should deviate greatly from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4820)|
| 1:20:24| Transitional growth, I think natural transitions can occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4824)|
| 1:20:29| Spot zoning, I'm against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4829)|
| 1:20:33| Finger annexation and things like that I would be against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4833)|
| 1:20:36| But as far as land use, I would really stand behind the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4836)|
| 1:20:42| You served on the library board, and how do you feel about our branch libraries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4842)|
| 1:20:47| and as far as the budget is concerned with the library that we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4847)|
| 1:20:53| The libraries are really hurting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4853)|
| 1:20:55| I mentioned I heard somebody say about the Norwood Branch and the Sequoia Branch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4855)|
| 1:20:59| We have a mascot library that doesn't even have a public restroom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4859)|
| 1:21:02| and that's pretty pitiful for Knox County, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4862)|
| 1:21:07| The branch libraries, there's a lot of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4867)|
| 1:21:10| Knox County is so diverse, and geographically there's all these different remote areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4870)|
| 1:21:15| and I've heard some people say, well, there only needed to be one north, one south, one east, one west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4875)|
| 1:21:21| But the diversity of our county and the geographics, I don't know if we just need to have little kiosks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4881)|
| 1:21:28| but I know that they have tried to centralize the ordering to the downtown area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4888)|
| 1:21:33| and the budget is really cramped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4893)|
| 1:21:36| The numbers, it's going to be hard to maintain a library, but it's something that we need to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4896)|
| 1:21:41| because if we don't have a good library system, we're not going to get the businesses in here that we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4901)|
| 1:21:50| Have you been involved with the schools there in the 9th District?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4910)|
| 1:21:53| I know that you were homeschooling, but have you been involved with the educational process there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4913)|
| 1:21:59| in terms of the PTAs or any of the things that are going on in the schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4919)|
| 1:22:03| I have not been involved with the PTA, although I do communicate quite often with the principal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4923)|
| 1:22:08| at Bonnie K Elementary, and she and I often speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4928)|
| 1:22:12| and I'm very involved with a lot of the parents in the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4932)|
| 1:22:15| I think we have a great school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4935)|
| 1:22:18| If there were any improvements that you would like to see made in the schools there in South Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4938)|
| 1:22:22| what would that be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4942)|
| 1:22:27| I think just for parents and to spend more time with their kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4947)|
| 1:22:35| That's what all kids need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4955)|
| 1:22:36| Would you be willing to wait on being sworn in if you were appointed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4956)|
| 1:22:39| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4959)|
| 1:22:45| Are there any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4965)|
| 1:22:48| Thank you, Mr. Dupree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4968)|
| 1:22:53| Next, Ed Frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4973)|
| 1:23:07| My name is Ed Frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4987)|
| 1:23:08| I'm at 3709 Southview Circle, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4988)|
| 1:23:15| I'll give you some brief information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4995)|
| 1:23:18| I assume everybody's got the resume there in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=4998)|
| 1:23:21| I'll go down that briefly and then elaborate a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5001)|
| 1:23:26| I'm 67 years old, married to Judy Simpson Frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5006)|
| 1:23:31| My wife was born in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5011)|
| 1:23:34| She lived there about 20 years, went to South High School, so she knows South Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5014)|
| 1:23:39| and the people of South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5019)|
| 1:23:41| I married her, and we moved to Kentucky, and I'll elaborate on that a little later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5021)|
| 1:23:48| We have two children, both married, have five grandchildren.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5028)|
| 1:23:52| I served my military in the United States Coast Guard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5032)|
| 1:23:55| As far as education is concerned, I went to Carson-Newman College,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5035)|
| 1:23:59| earned a degree in political science,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5039)|
| 1:24:02| and was accepted at the University of Louisville Law School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5042)|
| 1:24:07| That's the reason we left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5047)|
| 1:24:09| I married my wife when I was a senior at Carson-Newman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5049)|
| 1:24:12| and we went to Louisville where I attended the University of Louisville Law School at night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5052)|
| 1:24:18| worked during the day for State Farm Insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5058)|
| 1:24:22| My job at State Farm, which I worked for 35 years, was in claims,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5062)|
| 1:24:27| so my experience is in investigating, negotiating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5067)|
| 1:24:32| and settling mostly personal injury automobile accident claims.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5072)|
| 1:24:37| So in that type of job, in that type of environment, you must do a lot of listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5077)|
| 1:24:42| You can imagine people who have been involved in accidents are pretty upset,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5082)|
| 1:24:47| so it requires somebody to get in there and try to calm their nerves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5087)|
| 1:24:53| and try to resolve the issues that you're faced with lots of times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5093)|
| 1:24:57| injuries, resolving the settlement of their cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5097)|
| 1:25:01| So I look at myself as a listener, not a talker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5101)|
| 1:25:05| If I'm appointed by you all, then I feel like that would be my main point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5105)|
| 1:25:10| would be to listen to your experience and to trust you as far as issues that are concerned come before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5110)|
| 1:25:19| As far as political office experience, we lived in Kentucky 35 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5119)|
| 1:25:25| in a little town called Flatwoods, Kentucky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5125)|
| 1:25:27| Many of you probably aren't familiar with that town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5127)|
| 1:25:29| It's in far eastern Kentucky right on the Ohio River where Ohio and West Virginia come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5129)|
| 1:25:34| Probably the most famous person that came out of Flatwoods is Billy Ray Cyrus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5134)|
| 1:25:38| the father of Miley Cyrus of Hannah, Montana.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5138)|
| 1:25:41| So if you've got any grandkids or young children, you're probably familiar with that name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5141)|
| 1:25:46| I was elected to the city council there in 1990 and was re-elected three times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5146)|
| 1:25:54| I am somewhat familiar with budgets, although considerably less than the ones that you'll be dealing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5154)|
| 1:25:59| In Kentucky you don't fool with school board issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5159)|
| 1:26:03| The school boards in Kentucky deal with their own budgets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5163)|
| 1:26:08| but we work with a budget every year, so that would be eight budgets that I was involved in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5168)|
| 1:26:15| As far as volunteer activity is concerned, I volunteer at the Bonnecate Elementary School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5175)|
| 1:26:25| where I volunteer as a reader for Laura Snapp's first grade class,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5185)|
| 1:26:30| which I work with her once a week for several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5190)|
| 1:26:34| Now she teaches kindergarten, so I'm working again with her reading for her kindergarten class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5194)|
| 1:26:40| They also have a little program out there, which I think is nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5200)|
| 1:26:43| Paul's probably familiar with it, where they have greeters that are parents, grandparents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5203)|
| 1:26:49| and some school board person there where you stand in front of the school early in the morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5209)|
| 1:26:53| and as the parents pull up in their cars, you open the car door and extend a greeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5213)|
| 1:27:00| and help the child out of the car and let them go into the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5220)|
| 1:27:04| I've also worked on the South Knoxville Senior Center Search Committee with Paul,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5224)|
| 1:27:13| appointed with others by Mayor Ragsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5233)|
| 1:27:16| I worked with Dr. Bruce Walker, who headed that committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5236)|
| 1:27:19| as we went out and tried to secure, with the permission of the committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5239)|
| 1:27:24| the piece of property that's now sitting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5244)|
| 1:27:27| I also worked with the committee in the design, getting input from the community in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5247)|
| 1:27:35| I live in the South Point Community Subdivision off of Maryville Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5255)|
| 1:27:40| and in the year 2000, the developer turned that over to the Homeowners Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5260)|
| 1:27:47| and I was on the board of directors there for four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5267)|
| 1:27:51| We also established a neighborhood watch program, and they asked me to be the coordinator for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5271)|
| 1:27:56| so I worked with former Sheriff Tim Hutchinson and his group, Nancy Brown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5276)|
| 1:28:01| as we began to develop and put into place a neighborhood watch program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5281)|
| 1:28:05| and that continues to function to this day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5285)|
| 1:28:10| I do the buying for the Chihuahua Baptist Association, which is in Blount County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5290)|
| 1:28:15| I go to Second Harvest every week, where we purchase food for a free food and clothing pantry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5295)|
| 1:28:23| And lastly, as far as volunteer experience, I'm a volunteer for the American Heart Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5303)|
| 1:28:28| simply collecting money in my neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5308)|
| 1:28:35| I think I can work with Paul, should you choose to appoint me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5315)|
| 1:28:41| and we've known each other for several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5321)|
| 1:28:49| I think that's about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5329)|
| 1:28:51| Take any questions you might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5331)|
| 1:28:54| I'd like to start the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5334)|
| 1:28:56| Ed, I'm going to ask you the same thing about the TIF over in South Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5336)|
| 1:29:01| and do you think there is a good use for TIFs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5341)|
| 1:29:05| Yeah, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5345)|
| 1:29:07| I like Mr. Boyer's answer there, that there's going to be those situations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5347)|
| 1:29:11| where the developer is going to need some assistance, and where that's the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5351)|
| 1:29:17| Just for the example of that South Grove development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5357)|
| 1:29:23| but I think you also need to look at what impact that's going to have on the rest of the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5363)|
| 1:29:29| So I'd be willing to consider that seriously, should that come before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5369)|
| 1:29:36| You know we're having a growth experience in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5376)|
| 1:29:40| Of course, you know, the developers are wanting to make every penny they can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5380)|
| 1:29:45| and the community wants to protect their assets too, you know, their houses and things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5385)|
| 1:29:51| and keep it sort of like it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5391)|
| 1:29:53| How would you work, to be fair, what would you do or could you do to help get both parties together?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5393)|
| 1:30:04| Oh, gosh, Paul.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5404)|
| 1:30:06| You mean where there's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5406)|
| 1:30:08| Yeah, where the developer wants to do this, and the community is against this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5408)|
| 1:30:12| How could you work, to be fair, to both sides?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5412)|
| 1:30:15| What would you do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5415)|
| 1:30:16| Well, we've got this situation on...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5416)|
| 1:30:18| I don't know if they're all familiar with the situation across from Winkles there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5418)|
| 1:30:22| where the gentlemen want the apartments or the townhouses to go in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5422)|
| 1:30:26| Are you referring to a situation like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5426)|
| 1:30:28| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5428)|
| 1:30:30| I'm a strong believer in the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5430)|
| 1:30:32| I mean, if we're going to have a plan of that nature that's trying to control, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5432)|
| 1:30:38| where commercial goes, where residential goes, where businesses go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5438)|
| 1:30:42| then I think we need to stick with that, assuming it's a good plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5442)|
| 1:30:46| So I would probably be strongly opposed to changing that concept, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5446)|
| 1:30:53| once that's been put into place, unless there's some extenuating circumstances, Paul,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5453)|
| 1:30:57| that I wouldn't know about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5457)|
| 1:31:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5460)|
| 1:31:02| I understood you went to law school there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5462)|
| 1:31:05| If you found money missing or being misappropriated in any of the county offices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5465)|
| 1:31:10| would you bring this to the forefront and ask for clarification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5470)|
| 1:31:14| even if it would mean harassment to you and your family?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5474)|
| 1:31:18| And how could or would you handle this to ensure the person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5478)|
| 1:31:20| or persons responsible were held accountable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5480)|
| 1:31:24| Well, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5484)|
| 1:31:25| I mean, the integrity of our community of offices is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5485)|
| 1:31:32| And if that was known to me, I think it's only the fair thing to do to bring that to light,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5492)|
| 1:31:40| and hopefully that wouldn't play too much on your family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5500)|
| 1:31:45| But you've got to be honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5505)|
| 1:31:48| You've got to be fair in that regard, and I know you've been through some of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5508)|
| 1:31:53| so I applaud you for the stand that you've taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5513)|
| 1:31:57| But, yeah, I'd certainly bring that to light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5517)|
| 1:32:01| We have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5521)|
| 1:32:03| I mean, government has taken a big enough hit here lately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5523)|
| 1:32:06| You've got the stigma that has caused the commission to be brought to the forefront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5526)|
| 1:32:14| So we've got to change that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5534)|
| 1:32:16| We've got to get people in there that are willing to be honest and fair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5536)|
| 1:32:21| and just bring a better light on our commission in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5541)|
| 1:32:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5547)|
| 1:32:33| Are you well enough?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5553)|
| 1:32:37| I'm retired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5557)|
| 1:32:38| I've got all the time in the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5558)|
| 1:32:42| Mr. Hammond, I think we need to have the chairman just state that everybody needs to state that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5562)|
| 1:32:47| right off the bat when they come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5567)|
| 1:32:49| Please do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5569)|
| 1:32:53| And I've got a quick question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5573)|
| 1:32:54| Are you through, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5574)|
| 1:32:57| Commissioner Hammond, are you finished?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5577)|
| 1:33:01| How long have you been in the community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5581)|
| 1:33:02| This is a great resume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5582)|
| 1:33:03| I really like your resume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5583)|
| 1:33:04| You've done a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5584)|
| 1:33:06| You've been in South Knox for how long?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5586)|
| 1:33:07| How long have you lived in the district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5587)|
| 1:33:08| About ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5588)|
| 1:33:13| So, you know, that's given me a chance to –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5593)|
| 1:33:16| I know I'm not from here originally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5596)|
| 1:33:18| but how long do you have to live in an area to get to know the people and the way they think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5598)|
| 1:33:22| And the ninth district is rural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5602)|
| 1:33:27| The growth is coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5607)|
| 1:33:28| You can see it coming gradually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5608)|
| 1:33:31| You know, you've got the South Grove coming in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5611)|
| 1:33:34| That's going to draw subdivisions, which it already has, and apartments and that type of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5614)|
| 1:33:40| So hopefully it will be done right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5620)|
| 1:33:43| You know, we can learn from the way things have taken place in the other areas of the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5623)|
| 1:33:47| and South Knoxville has got to do it right so we don't have the messes that some of the other parts are enduring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5627)|
| 1:33:55| Ed, when you were on city council there, what was the size of the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5635)|
| 1:33:59| What was the population?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5639)|
| 1:34:00| About 10,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5640)|
| 1:34:01| 10,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5641)|
| 1:34:02| Yeah, our budget was maybe $4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5642)|
| 1:34:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5643)|
| 1:34:06| You just go through, to some extent, some of the same things you do, just in a larger scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5646)|
| 1:34:13| Good resume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5653)|
| 1:34:20| No other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5660)|
| 1:34:24| Thank you, Mr. Frank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5664)|
| 1:34:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5665)|
| 1:34:28| Claudia Lentz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5668)|
| 1:34:36| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5676)|
| 1:34:37| My name is Claudia Lentz, and I live at 816 Dedrick Road in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5677)|
| 1:34:44| I'm here today because for the first time since moving to Knoxville 11 years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5684)|
| 1:34:49| I'm truly excited about the direction of our county government, and I'd like to be a part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5689)|
| 1:34:54| My credentials for this appointment are simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5694)|
| 1:34:57| I'm a citizen of Knox County, and I care about what is happening in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5697)|
| 1:35:02| Also, I believe that the people chosen to fill these temporary positions should have neither a political agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5702)|
| 1:35:09| nor a vested interest in the outcome of the upcoming elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5709)|
| 1:35:14| I know that some of you are concerned about the experience and budgeting expertise of the applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5714)|
| 1:35:20| However, if you consider the events of the last year for which the eyes of the country are now upon us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5720)|
| 1:35:27| as well as the voice of the voters as raised in the recent primary elections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5727)|
| 1:35:32| I would fervently hope that the remaining commissioners and their appointees would, if at all possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5732)|
| 1:35:38| defer major budgetary decisions to the commission chosen by the voters in the upcoming election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5738)|
| 1:35:45| With regard to zoning and land use issues, I can only assure you that I would make it my business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5745)|
| 1:35:51| to familiarize myself with any zoning and land use issues I would be asked to vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5751)|
| 1:35:58| I would not only learn the existing zoning status of each parcel, as well as the proposed changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5758)|
| 1:36:03| but will consider the Zoning Committee's findings and recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5763)|
| 1:36:07| And I would personally visit each location prior to the commission meeting at which it is scheduled to be on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5767)|
| 1:36:15| I understand that I'm not a politician nor even a public figure, but simply a concerned citizen who is willing to get involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5775)|
| 1:36:24| That is exactly why I hope that you give my application serious consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5784)|
| 1:36:29| If appointed, I will work very hard and do my best to fulfill the obligations of the seat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5789)|
| 1:36:34| and assist in conducting the regular business of this commission until the voters elect their new commission in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5794)|
| 1:36:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5801)|
| 1:36:43| Thank you. Commissioner Pasternak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5803)|
| 1:36:46| Ma'am, I'm going to ask you the same thing about these TIFs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5806)|
| 1:36:49| Do you think that TIFs are needed in other parts of the county like they were in South Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5809)|
| 1:36:53| Or do you think that one in South Knoxville was needed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5813)|
| 1:36:56| I do not know enough about TIFs to answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5816)|
| 1:37:00| Okay. Well, you answered the one already on land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5820)|
| 1:37:03| I knew that would come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5823)|
| 1:37:10| How do you think business on the commission should be conducted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5830)|
| 1:37:17| How should the business be conducted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5837)|
| 1:37:20| How do you think we should conduct business on our commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5840)|
| 1:37:23| In other words, do you think that – well, I don't want to answer the question for you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5843)|
| 1:37:29| but we've had a lot of talk at some times we get offered for the agenda and things like that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5849)|
| 1:37:36| leading to other things, but I guess I'm answering it for you, though, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5856)|
| 1:37:40| But do you think that when our agenda is set that it should be right in concrete,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5860)|
| 1:37:45| that we could not deviate from that even though something important was to come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5865)|
| 1:37:50| between the time the agenda items were put on and the commission meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5870)|
| 1:37:55| I think that the agendas for the meetings are so full that, yes, I think that the agenda should be followed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5875)|
| 1:38:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5888)|
| 1:38:11| Let me ask what kind of interactions or connections or contacts you've had with the schools in your area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5891)|
| 1:38:17| None.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5897)|
| 1:38:18| I'm single with no children, so I have a lot of time to devote to this endeavor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5898)|
| 1:38:27| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5907)|
| 1:38:29| You know the question I'm going to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5909)|
| 1:38:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5911)|
| 1:38:33| I will certainly wait until the very end of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5913)|
| 1:38:38| I like your passion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5918)|
| 1:38:40| I am very passionate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5920)|
| 1:38:41| And I like your enthusiasm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5921)|
| 1:38:43| And whether you get this appointment or not, I just want to encourage you to maintain that passion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5923)|
| 1:38:48| because you seem to have a real want to be involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5928)|
| 1:38:52| And so I would just encourage you to continue to do that because seeing the type of passion that you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5932)|
| 1:38:57| and you're obviously interested and you want to make a difference, that's very refreshing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5937)|
| 1:39:02| And so, again, I would just encourage you to continue on regardless of what happens here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5942)|
| 1:39:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5946)|
| 1:39:09| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5949)|
| 1:39:10| Claudia, what about any experience with budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5950)|
| 1:39:12| Do you know what our budget is a year and have any idea?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5952)|
| 1:39:14| I do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5954)|
| 1:39:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5955)|
| 1:39:19| I'm willing to learn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5959)|
| 1:39:22| I'm very clever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5962)|
| 1:39:28| Are there any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5968)|
| 1:39:29| Do you have any conflict of interest you can think of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5969)|
| 1:39:31| I do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5971)|
| 1:39:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5972)|
| 1:39:38| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5978)|
| 1:39:40| Thank you, Ms. Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5980)|
| 1:39:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5981)|
| 1:39:44| Next we have Martin Pleasant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5984)|
| 1:39:59| I'm Martin Pleasant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=5999)|
| 1:40:01| I live at 4737 Reed Lane in South Knoxville, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6001)|
| 1:40:08| First I want to thank my wife, Virginia, who's here this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6008)|
| 1:40:11| Thanks for your support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6011)|
| 1:40:13| I also want to thank my son, who's with my mother, and I want to thank both of them for their support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6013)|
| 1:40:18| And I also want to take a moment for us to think about the soldiers who are in Iraq| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6018)|
| 1:40:25| because that's going on in our nation now, and I want us to reflect on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6025)|
| 1:40:29| and wish them a safe return home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6029)|
| 1:40:32| And I want to ask everyone here if you support the troops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6032)|
| 1:40:37| Everybody support the troops?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6037)|
| 1:40:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6040)|
| 1:40:41| This body has reached consensus?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6041)|
| 1:40:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6044)|
| 1:40:47| That's kind of the tone I want to set with where I would be with this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6047)|
| 1:40:52| is to work towards consensus and how we achieve that and we find common ground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6052)|
| 1:40:58| and where are those things that we agree on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6058)|
| 1:41:00| and then we can work from there on the things that we may disagree on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6060)|
| 1:41:03| or have a different perspective on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6063)|
| 1:41:07| And I want to thank the commissioners for your efforts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6067)|
| 1:41:11| for holding these committee talks so that people can give their input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6071)|
| 1:41:16| Tank, I want to thank you for your coming to the PTSA meetings at Austin East.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6076)|
| 1:41:23| It's good to have elected officials that attend those things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6083)|
| 1:41:25| those neighborhood meetings and those sorts of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6085)|
| 1:41:28| And, Tony, I want to really thank you for all your efforts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6088)|
| 1:41:31| with teaching the young people of our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6091)|
| 1:41:35| because working with you with that, having service learning projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6095)|
| 1:41:39| getting the kids out, and going above and beyond what most teachers don't do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6099)|
| 1:41:44| And I witnessed you do that, so I'm very pleased that you're on this board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6104)|
| 1:41:47| because I know you will go above and beyond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6107)|
| 1:41:50| And those are the kinds of things that we need in our schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6110)|
| 1:41:53| is service learning projects where the students actually get out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6113)|
| 1:41:56| and participate in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6116)|
| 1:42:00| Mr. Lambert, thank you very much for your support on the Candy Factory efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6120)|
| 1:42:06| And I know that we may be on the opposite ends of the political spectrum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6126)|
| 1:42:10| but sometimes those things come back to the same point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6130)|
| 1:42:13| And I appreciate that, and I want you to know that I fully support the skate park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6133)|
| 1:42:18| My son plays in a band, and they help do a benefit to help support skate parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6138)|
| 1:42:25| But something about that in the park is that it could be done in a way to fit within the park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6145)|
| 1:42:30| and also improve our stormwater features that also exist in that park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6150)|
| 1:42:37| So that's something we want to consider when it fits in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6157)|
| 1:42:39| that it may have an additional function that it could have in the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6159)|
| 1:42:45| Not that I know all the commissioners, but I know a few of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6165)|
| 1:42:49| But, Ivan, I want to thank you for your efforts with City Stormwater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6169)|
| 1:42:53| and coming out with you to work on projects has always been a pleasure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6173)|
| 1:42:58| So just keep in mind that, you know, put in a good word for the county stormwater to the city folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6178)|
| 1:43:04| You know, we want to be on good terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6184)|
| 1:43:06| So I appreciate all your efforts there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6186)|
| 1:43:10| And, Paul, I want to address you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6190)|
| 1:43:12| You have a wonderful wife, and I know that it's hard to be in the public eye,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6192)|
| 1:43:17| especially when people make disparaging remarks about your family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6197)|
| 1:43:22| But I know that your wife's wonderful, and you're very fortunate to have her in your life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6202)|
| 1:43:29| And so, for me, I think it's important that family comes first in your life, and that's always first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6209)|
| 1:43:36| And you should treat everyone as family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6216)|
| 1:43:39| So keep that in mind when you deal with anybody in the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6219)|
| 1:43:42| And I try to, but sometimes you get mad at your family as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6222)|
| 1:43:49| In keeping with that, I want to say something that I put on my website when I was running for office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6229)|
| 1:43:54| which I did seek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6234)|
| 1:43:56| I ran against Mr. Pinkston in South Knoxville twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6236)|
| 1:44:00| The second time I think I received 35 percent of the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6240)|
| 1:44:03| So the voters are familiar with me, the constituency in South Knoxville, through the election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6243)|
| 1:44:09| Also through my work at Knox County, I work in the stormwater department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6249)|
| 1:44:13| I've probably driven almost every road in this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6253)|
| 1:44:16| I'm familiar with all parts of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6256)|
| 1:44:19| And so I have a unique perspective of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6259)|
| 1:44:22| I look at it from more of a topographic perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6262)|
| 1:44:26| And how we have rolling hills, mountains, ridges, valleys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6266)|
| 1:44:31| And so that's my perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6271)|
| 1:44:33| And that relates to land-use issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6273)|
| 1:44:35| because certain land-use activities don't match certain topographic features.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6275)|
| 1:44:41| And so that's important when we do our design and development in this community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6281)|
| 1:44:44| that we look at those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6284)|
| 1:44:46| And I think we're a little bit, we're a step behind in our development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6286)|
| 1:44:50| in that we're not ahead making plans in advance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6290)|
| 1:44:54| Communities used to be designed in advance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6294)|
| 1:44:57| I grew up in Kingsport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6297)|
| 1:44:59| Kingsport was a planned city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6299)|
| 1:45:01| It was planned and then built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6301)|
| 1:45:03| And because of that, it has good infrastructure in certain aspects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6303)|
| 1:45:07| And that's where we're behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6307)|
| 1:45:09| We need to step ahead, and the sector plans are okay for zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6309)|
| 1:45:13| but they're not truly fully fleshed-out plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6313)|
| 1:45:16| And how that can factor into TIFs is that we're behind on TIFs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6316)|
| 1:45:20| We have people coming asking for TIFs instead of us saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6320)|
| 1:45:24| here are these areas where they're needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6324)|
| 1:45:26| These are the blighted areas that we need to encourage development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6326)|
| 1:45:30| So we need to be drawing the boundaries, creating the zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6330)|
| 1:45:33| and then inviting people to come and participate in those zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6333)|
| 1:45:37| versus them coming to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6337)|
| 1:45:39| So we're kind of backwards on that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6339)|
| 1:45:41| We need to get ahead of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6341)|
| 1:45:44| Public trust is important, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6344)|
| 1:45:46| You've probably heard that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6346)|
| 1:45:48| Hazardous waste is an issue in our district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6348)|
| 1:45:50| It still hasn't been fully finished, been cleaned up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6350)|
| 1:45:53| We still have several sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6353)|
| 1:45:55| It's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6355)|
| 1:45:56| We've got to stay on top of that for all the obvious reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6356)|
| 1:46:00| Transportation is extremely important, which we all know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6360)|
| 1:46:04| We've had development getting ahead of our road infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6364)|
| 1:46:07| We have roads in South Knoxville such as John Sevier, Chapman Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6367)|
| 1:46:11| Alcoa Highway, which all are inadequate for their safety features.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6371)|
| 1:46:16| We need to work with the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6376)|
| 1:46:18| have a unified voice to improve these road systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6378)|
| 1:46:23| And that may alleviate us needing to give TIFs to developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6383)|
| 1:46:26| to make certain corrections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6386)|
| 1:46:30| Billboards, somebody mentioned billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6390)|
| 1:46:32| We can have appropriate size, smaller signs that can fit into our landscape| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6392)|
| 1:46:36| that will give people the information that they need to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6396)|
| 1:46:39| They don't have to be bigger and better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6399)|
| 1:46:43| Sometimes we have unintended consequences from development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6403)|
| 1:46:47| and from our land use planning that we don't always think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6407)|
| 1:46:50| We're not always considering all the factors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6410)|
| 1:46:53| The water tower is a great example of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6413)|
| 1:46:56| There's other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6416)|
| 1:46:58| And working in drainage and public works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6418)|
| 1:47:01| I get to hear everything about perceived problems versus real problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6421)|
| 1:47:06| and sort of coming to terms with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6426)|
| 1:47:08| But those things can be dealt with in advance with good planning in advance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6428)|
| 1:47:12| An idea I want to throw out there which I'd like to see this body work towards is called| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6432)|
| 1:47:16| transferable development rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6436)|
| 1:47:20| So keep that in your mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6440)|
| 1:47:23| And I'll finish with saying that I pledge to you that I will serve humbly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6443)|
| 1:47:27| be positive, treat people with respect, stay involved, study the issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6447)|
| 1:47:33| be prepared at meetings, follow the golden rule, keep my word, and always do my best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6453)|
| 1:47:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6460)|
| 1:47:41| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6461)|
| 1:47:43| Well, you about halfway answered this, but I want to ask you about TIFs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6463)|
| 1:47:46| Again, do you think TIFs are needed in some areas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6466)|
| 1:47:49| Do you think they're beneficial to the community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6469)|
| 1:47:51| I think they can be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6471)|
| 1:47:53| Again, I think that we're getting on a slippery slope of what the original intent was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6473)|
| 1:47:58| was part of the urban renewal programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6478)|
| 1:48:02| and about areas that were extremely dilapidated and blighted that banks were redlining those districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6482)|
| 1:48:08| and nobody wanted to bring their money into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6488)|
| 1:48:10| Now we're kind of graying that area a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6490)|
| 1:48:15| There are other ways to encourage development and support work with developers besides TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6495)|
| 1:48:23| It's starting, I think, to become a slippery slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6503)|
| 1:48:25| But there are cases where I think it is useful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6505)|
| 1:48:29| Well, you know all the TIFs, Martin, have been given inside the city in the blighted areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6509)|
| 1:48:34| except for the exception of Turkey Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6514)|
| 1:48:37| Other than that, the county has only given one TIF, and that's the South Grove.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6517)|
| 1:48:41| But the county has to vote on all of those TIFs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6521)|
| 1:48:43| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6523)|
| 1:48:44| But we do that to help the city because we have to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6524)|
| 1:48:48| They'd have to have a pilot program like they give the new Sentinel down there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6528)|
| 1:48:51| which I'm not for those things at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6531)|
| 1:48:55| Anyway, another thing there is you being an employee of the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6535)|
| 1:49:00| how would that affect you in making a decision about a development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6540)|
| 1:49:04| Well, I don't actually review development plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6544)|
| 1:49:07| It's not part of my job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6547)|
| 1:49:09| No, but they would be coming to you for a vote up or down on a development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6549)|
| 1:49:13| Well, it shouldn't affect it at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6553)|
| 1:49:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6555)|
| 1:49:16| Because I'm not in that chain of. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6556)|
| 1:49:18| I may be consulted by the plans reviewer if they may ask me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6558)|
| 1:49:22| is there any drainage problems in that area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6562)|
| 1:49:24| And then I would give my input on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6564)|
| 1:49:27| Thank you, Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6567)|
| 1:49:28| Good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6568)|
| 1:49:31| Mr. Delabere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6571)|
| 1:49:32| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6572)|
| 1:49:33| Martin, I want to ask you this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6573)|
| 1:49:34| and I don't think we're quite as far apart as you think we are on land use issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6574)|
| 1:49:39| I do strongly believe in property rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6579)|
| 1:49:42| But when a neighborhood, if you're opposed to a development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6582)|
| 1:49:48| would you be more likely to use your opposition as leverage to shape that development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6588)|
| 1:49:56| or would you be more likely to, in other words, tell the developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6596)|
| 1:50:02| you know, look, I'm not for this the way it is now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6602)|
| 1:50:05| but if you'll change this and add this retention pond, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6605)|
| 1:50:10| then I could really be for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6610)|
| 1:50:12| Are you the kind of person that would say, you know what, I'm against this development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6612)|
| 1:50:15| I'm against the density you're asking for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6615)|
| 1:50:18| and there's no way I'm ever going to go along with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6618)|
| 1:50:21| Or are you more the kind of person that would say, you know what, I'm against this now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6621)|
| 1:50:25| but if you'll change this right here, I'll be more likely to support it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6625)|
| 1:50:30| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6630)|
| 1:50:31| I think it would be more from the perspective of what they're doing is if it's going to cause harm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6631)|
| 1:50:36| And if they can mitigate that harm in some fashion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6636)|
| 1:50:41| then that's going to make me more likely to be in support of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6641)|
| 1:50:49| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6649)|
| 1:50:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6652)|
| 1:50:53| I answered it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6653)|
| 1:50:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6654)|
| 1:50:56| You piqued my interest on transferable development rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6656)|
| 1:51:01| Tell me about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6661)|
| 1:51:02| Let me elaborate on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6662)|
| 1:51:05| What that is is it's where a geographic boundary is created,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6665)|
| 1:51:10| and within that boundary you set a density limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6670)|
| 1:51:15| And so let's assume you say one unit per acre, and you had a 100-acre piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6675)|
| 1:51:21| You would have 100 units that you could sell to a developer for them to develop within that geographic boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6681)|
| 1:51:29| So let's say if we said Stock Creek area in South Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6689)|
| 1:51:35| and there was a geographic zone created that could be done by this body that would set a density for that whole zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6695)|
| 1:51:43| and the developer wanted to build in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6703)|
| 1:51:45| they would have to buy that development right from the property owners that live in there to create that development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6705)|
| 1:51:52| to increase their density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6712)|
| 1:51:53| And what that would do, in effect, for that whole geographic zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6713)|
| 1:51:57| you would have if they did more clustering, they could get more units within that cluster,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6717)|
| 1:52:03| and that preserves more open space for things like park, floodplains, horse trails, those types of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6723)|
| 1:52:10| Can you give an example of a community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6730)|
| 1:52:12| Yeah, there is a community outside of Atlanta.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6732)|
| 1:52:16| Now, obviously, Atlanta has a lot of development pressures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6736)|
| 1:52:19| and they've tried to come up with a whole variety of ways to deal with this intense development pressure that they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6739)|
| 1:52:26| I mean, they're having water shortage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6746)|
| 1:52:28| I mean, it's very, very well ahead where we could wind up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6748)|
| 1:52:33| where we don't want to wind up with their kind of problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6753)|
| 1:52:37| And I can send you the link.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6757)|
| 1:52:41| I went and I visited it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6761)|
| 1:52:43| What they did was they tried to take all the elements that you would want in a development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6763)|
| 1:52:48| unique kind of housing, curbing, I mean, everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6768)|
| 1:52:51| and they put bakeries within the development itself, so they did mixed use, but it was still a neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6771)|
| 1:52:56| And they actually kept a farm as part of the development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6776)|
| 1:53:00| and then they have like estate homes as part of the farm area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6780)|
| 1:53:04| and then clustered housing as part of the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6784)|
| 1:53:06| And they were able to do it through this process of drawing this geographic zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6786)|
| 1:53:10| setting a density, and then transferring the development rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6790)|
| 1:53:13| And they're currently expanding that geographic zone because they're finding great success with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6793)|
| 1:53:19| So those are the kinds of things that I think that this body should investigate more about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6799)|
| 1:53:26| as a potential way that we can really get everybody involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6806)|
| 1:53:31| Everybody shares in their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6811)|
| 1:53:33| They don't lose their value where you say, well, you can't develop here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6813)|
| 1:53:36| but you're costing me my value of my property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6816)|
| 1:53:39| whereas they can still keep that value, sell it, and keep the farm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6819)|
| 1:53:43| and still have the development within that same zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6823)|
| 1:53:47| So it's a great option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6827)|
| 1:53:53| Martin, let me ask you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6833)|
| 1:53:55| Are you saying this body here, if you owned a 100-acre farm out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6835)|
| 1:54:00| we can vote and tell you what to do with that property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6840)|
| 1:54:04| No, I'm saying that it would have to take, in Georgia,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6844)|
| 1:54:09| they had to get approval from the state legislature actually to create these zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6849)|
| 1:54:15| But what I'm saying is you're saying we can dictate to that person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6855)|
| 1:54:18| if we get from the state legislature then what he can do with that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6858)|
| 1:54:22| No, the way they did it there was that the property owners themselves created the boundaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6862)|
| 1:54:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6866)|
| 1:54:27| That they got them to come in and do the input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6867)|
| 1:54:31| That's basically what we did here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6871)|
| 1:54:32| I can't remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6872)|
| 1:54:33| It wasn't the Kern Farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6873)|
| 1:54:35| But you remember when they came down and the only people that can build on that place is the family?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6875)|
| 1:54:40| I'm sure you remember that, Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6880)|
| 1:54:41| That comes through the federal government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6881)|
| 1:54:43| I don't remember what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6883)|
| 1:54:44| So we do have that in place more or less because it's all set up to be contained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6884)|
| 1:54:48| They're the only people that can build on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6888)|
| 1:54:50| We bought their land rights, if I'm not mistaken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6890)|
| 1:54:52| Is that not correct, with the federal government's money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6892)|
| 1:54:55| Cruz Farm, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6895)|
| 1:54:56| I believe you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6896)|
| 1:54:57| Yeah, that's another tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6897)|
| 1:54:59| We have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6899)|
| 1:55:00| It's a similar idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6900)|
| 1:55:01| But it's up to the—I don't want to pass anything that we can tell the landowner that you've got to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6901)|
| 1:55:07| If he wants to do it, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6907)|
| 1:55:08| That's not what I'm suggesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6908)|
| 1:55:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6910)|
| 1:55:11| I understand now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6911)|
| 1:55:13| Are there any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6913)|
| 1:55:17| Seeing none, thank you, Mr. Pleasant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6917)|
| 1:55:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6918)|
| 1:55:22| Our last person for the evening will be Chuck Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6922)|
| 1:55:33| I'm Chuck Ward, and I live at 8715 Martinville Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6933)|
| 1:55:37| I guess I get the distinct pleasure of going last, and hopefully I can leave a lasting impression upon you guys and ladies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6937)|
| 1:55:44| I as well would like to thank the county commission for allowing me this opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6944)|
| 1:55:49| I have lived in the 9th District of South Knoxville for 39 of my 41 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6949)|
| 1:55:55| I have lived it, loved it, and watched it grow to what it has become.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6955)|
| 1:56:00| I'm truly amazed and very proud of what we are seeing happen in the 9th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6960)|
| 1:56:04| I think the waterfront development is amazing and long overdue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6964)|
| 1:56:09| I have a real estate investment company, and I have single-handedly purchased over 100 homes in South Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6969)|
| 1:56:16| and taken some of these homes that are condemned and redeveloped them and redone them into beautiful homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6976)|
| 1:56:22| and helped improve these neighborhoods where these homes are at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6982)|
| 1:56:26| I feel that I can bring great value to county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6986)|
| 1:56:30| I am young, very energetic, and honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6990)|
| 1:56:34| I have broad shoulders, and I have very good hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6994)|
| 1:56:39| With my day job, I deal with yearly budgets and estimates for the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=6999)|
| 1:56:45| and I have to stick with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7005)|
| 1:56:47| My investment company has 10 full-time employees that are like commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7007)|
| 1:56:53| There's always a problem, a question, a debt, or a decision that I have to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7013)|
| 1:56:59| I'm also acting president of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, Local 197.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7019)|
| 1:57:05| It has 125-plus members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7025)|
| 1:57:08| It's like a large county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7028)|
| 1:57:11| We hold monthly meetings that I am in charge of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7031)|
| 1:57:14| I'm also on the executive board of this organization, and I help make the monthly decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7034)|
| 1:57:20| My goal is to help put all the bad publicity and the bad blood behind us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7040)|
| 1:57:26| I want to help the current commission try to heal and mend this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7046)|
| 1:57:32| and make it better for the 9th District citizens and our newly elected commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7052)|
| 1:57:38| I have two major concerns in South Knoxville and the 9th District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7058)|
| 1:57:42| Chapman Highway and continued growth to the 9th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7062)|
| 1:57:47| And as for a skate park, I think that would be a great addition to South Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7067)|
| 1:57:51| because in this day and time, we need something to occupy our children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7071)|
| 1:57:55| besides a Wii, a game box, or a computer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7075)|
| 1:57:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7079)|
| 1:58:02| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7082)|
| 1:58:03| Well, Chuck, I'm going to ask you the same thing about a tip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7083)|
| 1:58:06| Do you think there are a need for tips?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7086)|
| 1:58:08| I think there are certain areas in Knox County that there are needs for tips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7088)|
| 1:58:11| I think probably without the tip there in the South Knoxville area that we got,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7091)|
| 1:58:16| that establishment of growth may not have taken place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7096)|
| 1:58:21| I really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7101)|
| 1:58:22| Well, you know the tip was used especially for the road and the red lights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7102)|
| 1:58:25| and things like that is what it's used for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7105)|
| 1:58:27| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7107)|
| 1:58:28| But it was my understanding that if we hadn't got the roads in the situation they were in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7108)|
| 1:58:31| and the red lights, we would have never got the growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7111)|
| 1:58:33| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7113)|
| 1:58:34| You're correct on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7114)|
| 1:58:36| You're a real estate investment thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7116)|
| 1:58:40| What do you think about the control of land usage and things on the developers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7120)|
| 1:58:46| How would you work to have the developer and the community try to get together on these things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7126)|
| 1:58:51| What would you do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7131)|
| 1:58:53| Well, I would listen to the community's concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7133)|
| 1:58:55| I feel like that the community has certain concerns, certain developments need to be made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7135)|
| 1:59:00| and certain developments don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7140)|
| 1:59:02| I've heard mixed feelings about the developments going in on John Spear Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7142)|
| 1:59:07| I've heard it was going to be apartments, and I've also heard it was going to be a subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7147)|
| 1:59:11| But I'd like to know more about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7151)|
| 1:59:13| My concern with apartments would be a great concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7153)|
| 1:59:17| versus building a subdivision with homes in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7157)|
| 1:59:21| What, if any, would be your main interstone commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7161)|
| 1:59:23| and where do you feel you could do the most for your community at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7163)|
| 1:59:27| I feel I could do the most for my community with a budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7167)|
| 1:59:31| I deal with a budget daily with the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7171)|
| 1:59:35| Also, with the local unions that I represent, we have a budget that we have to stick to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7175)|
| 1:59:40| Also, with my investment company, when we purchase a home, we set a budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7180)|
| 1:59:45| If you go over budget, you don't make any money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7185)|
| 1:59:47| So you have to stick to that budget and analyze that budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7187)|
| 1:59:51| and make sure you're spending the right money at the appropriate place and the appropriate time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7191)|
| 1:59:59| Are there any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7199)|
| 2:00:01| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7201)|
| 2:00:04| You said you were concerned about Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7204)|
| 2:00:06| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7206)|
| 2:00:07| I've had two close friends die on Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7207)|
| 2:00:09| What do you think need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7209)|
| 2:00:10| I mean, widening the road, turn lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7210)|
| 2:00:13| I specifically think we need a turn lane from downtown Knoxville to Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7213)|
| 2:00:19| I think it's basically a death trap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7219)|
| 2:00:21| There's a ton of speeding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7221)|
| 2:00:23| People are stopping, turning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7223)|
| 2:00:25| There's no place to go, and people have no choice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7225)|
| 2:00:27| but to cross the line and hit somebody head-on or run off the side of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7227)|
| 2:00:32| I think it's a major concern in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7232)|
| 2:00:34| The theatrical employees union, are these the sound technicians, the rigging, that type of thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7234)|
| 2:00:40| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7240)|
| 2:00:41| We do theatrical rigging, lighting, video, sound,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7241)|
| 2:00:47| just about everything that's set up at Thompson Bowlin Arena| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7247)|
| 2:00:49| and the Knoxville Civic Auditorium, Coliseum, and the Tennessee Theater our local is involved in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7249)|
| 2:00:54| You mentioned that you've bought 100 homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7254)|
| 2:00:57| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7257)|
| 2:00:58| And you have developed some of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7258)|
| 2:01:00| Can you shed some light on the types of development that you've done there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7260)|
| 2:01:03| Is it to buy the homes, improve them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7263)|
| 2:01:05| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7265)|
| 2:01:06| It would be more total renovation rather than develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7266)|
| 2:01:10| Anything that we can do to upgrade the home, make it look better for the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7270)|
| 2:01:16| anything that will bring greater value to the home and the neighborhood is what we strive to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7276)|
| 2:01:23| Would you wait to be sworn in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7283)|
| 2:01:24| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7284)|
| 2:01:25| And be here 15 minutes early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7285)|
| 2:01:32| Commissioner Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7292)|
| 2:01:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7293)|
| 2:01:34| I'm assuming that being in your industry that you would be supportive of the East Tennessee Film| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7294)|
| 2:01:39| and Television Commission and their efforts to continue the growth of one of our fastest growth industries?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7299)|
| 2:01:45| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7305)|
| 2:01:46| That's something I never thought of making a statement about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7306)|
| 2:01:48| but that's a very good point that you brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7308)|
| 2:01:51| We have a great deal of need for more of that in East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7311)|
| 2:01:55| We have a lot of beautiful landscape and a lot of great places that we could shoot major motion pictures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7315)|
| 2:02:00| here in this part of the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7320)|
| 2:02:02| And the East Tennessee Film Commission has been a great help part of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7322)|
| 2:02:06| but there is a great need of more of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7326)|
| 2:02:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7329)|
| 2:02:10| Actually, Michael Barnes has brought a major project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7330)|

| 2:02:27| Seeing none, thank you, Mr. Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7347)|

| 2:02:30| Thank you for the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7350)|
| 2:02:32| Is there anyone from the audience that would like to speak about anything that preceded us in the ninth district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7352)|
| 2:02:43| Mr. Strickland, my name is Mike Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7363)|
| 2:02:46| I just have really a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7366)|
| 2:02:48| Your address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7368)|
| 2:02:49| 7320 Twin Creek Road, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7369)|
| 2:02:53| To start the ninth district questions here, you read into the record Mr. Rose's letter of withdrawal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7373)|
| 2:03:02| My question was, I turned mine in yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7382)|
| 2:03:05| Was it read last night and has it been entered into the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7385)|
| 2:03:07| I wasn't given it for the record, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7387)|
| 2:03:09| I beg your pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7389)|
| 2:03:10| No, I wasn't given your withdrawal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7390)|
| 2:03:14| Can I give you a copy of it for the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7394)|
| 2:03:16| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7396)|
| 2:03:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7397)|
| 2:03:20| Is there anyone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7400)|
| 2:03:23| Would you like to have it read?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7403)|
| 2:03:25| I can read it if you like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7405)|
| 2:03:26| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7406)|
| 2:03:27| You want to read it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7407)|
| 2:03:28| You can read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7408)|
| 2:03:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7409)|
| 2:03:32| I want you to know that I got yours, but we don't turn them into the chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7412)|
| 2:03:36| Apparently Vernon Rose sent you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7416)|
| 2:03:37| I didn't even know he had turned one in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7417)|
| 2:03:39| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7419)|
| 2:03:40| He sent it to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7420)|
| 2:03:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7421)|
| 2:03:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7422)|
| 2:03:44| Well, I got it from somewhere, Paul.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7424)|
| 2:03:48| In that stack somewhere?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7428)|
| 2:03:49| I got one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7429)|
| 2:03:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7432)|
| 2:03:53| This was dated yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7433)|
| 2:03:54| Dear commissioners, based on the fact that I was a Republican primary winner for a seat 9A commission race,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7434)|
| 2:03:59| I submitted my resume for the interim appointment to serve until the general election in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7439)|
| 2:04:04| Now, after considering all that has transpired in the last couple of days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7444)|
| 2:04:07| plus the fact that my Democratic opponent in the August race has also applied for the appointment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7447)|
| 2:04:12| I believe it would be in the best interest of the voters of my district that I bow out of the appointment process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7452)|
| 2:04:17| Please consider this my letter of intent to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7457)|
| 2:04:21| I think it would be best and fairest if neither of the candidates that are running for the seat in the August general election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7461)|
| 2:04:26| should be appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7466)|
| 2:04:28| The voters spoke in the primary saying they wanted to select the person whom they wished to fill the commission seat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7468)|
| 2:04:34| so I believe it would be best to let them do that in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7474)|
| 2:04:37| Thank you for your consideration in this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7477)|
| 2:04:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7479)|
| 2:04:43| What happened, Mr. Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7483)|
| 2:04:44| Probably he's at my house today waiting on me since I left early this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7484)|
| 2:04:50| Is there anyone else from the 9th District?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7490)|
| 2:04:57| I'm here for Victoria DeVries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7497)|
| 2:04:59| My name is Patty Walker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7499)|
| 2:05:01| I live at 3037 Tipton Station Road in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7501)|
| 2:05:06| The very first time I ever saw Victoria DeVries was in the large assembly room here in 2002.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7506)|
| 2:05:14| There was a really important issue concerning South Knoxville and the Acme Powder Company that was before the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7514)|
| 2:05:21| We had a really hard time getting people to come out and just for a head count, but Victoria was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7521)|
| 2:05:30| Her two youngest children, and she was new to our neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7530)|
| 2:05:33| her two youngest children she had in a double stroller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7533)|
| 2:05:37| They were all there together though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7537)|
| 2:05:41| Concerning South Knoxville, I think the people that are doers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7541)|
| 2:05:49| that are really passionate about South Knoxville and Knox County in general, they're there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7549)|
| 2:05:58| Victoria's there picking up trash on the side of the roadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7558)|
| 2:06:02| volunteering, organizing the Homeowners Association, the meet and greet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7562)|
| 2:06:09| She's behind the scenes doing all the work that you normally don't have somebody to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7569)|
| 2:06:14| and definitely not somebody to volunteer for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7574)|
| 2:06:18| All of her and her children have always been present in everything that's important concerning South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7578)|
| 2:06:26| There's people that's been around forever in South Knoxville for years and years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7586)|
| 2:06:30| and when it comes to doing something, you wouldn't be able to shoot them out of the recliner with a rifle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7590)|
| 2:06:35| You just can't get them to do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7595)|
| 2:06:40| She's always there to help, and she don't just do it for herself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7600)|
| 2:06:45| but she does it for the county as well as South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7605)|
| 2:06:49| You can check these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7609)|
| 2:06:51| You don't know me, but you do know Paul Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7611)|
| 2:06:55| He can verify the things that I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7615)|
| 2:06:59| As a matter of fact, you can look around the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7619)|
| 2:07:02| You commissioners here can look around and see the people that are here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7622)|
| 2:07:08| and think back to how many of these faces look familiar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7628)|
| 2:07:13| There's been issues before this commission concerning South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7633)|
| 2:07:17| How many of these people back here have you ever seen in the main assembly room?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7637)|
| 2:07:24| I think that says a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7644)|
| 2:07:28| Anything that needs doing, she's there to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7648)|
| 2:07:31| She doesn't always get her name mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7651)|
| 2:07:33| She's not in the papers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7653)|
| 2:07:35| You don't always hear about it, but when it comes to doing, she's there to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7655)|
| 2:07:40| and that's what we need in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7660)|
| 2:07:42| We need more people like Victoria, but we need doers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7662)|
| 2:07:46| There's lots and lots of talkers, and there's lots of showmanship, and there's lots of knives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7666)|
| 2:07:53| but we need doers, and Victoria DeVries is a doer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7673)|
| 2:07:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7677)|
| 2:07:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7678)|
| 2:08:00| Is there anyone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7680)|
| 2:08:06| My name is Scott Dyer, and I'm president of the Woodfield Park Homeowner Association in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7686)|
| 2:08:11| I live at 429 Carla Drive, and I'm here for Victoria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7691)|
| 2:08:15| I don't know Victoria on a personal level, but I do know her, as the lady just said, as a doer in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7695)|
| 2:08:22| She's organized several homeowner association meetings, and I think she would serve the county commission well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7702)|
| 2:08:31| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7711)|
| 2:08:41| Hi, my name is Lisa Geralds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7721)|
| 2:08:42| I live at 1418 West John Sevier Highway, South Knoxville, 37920,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7722)|
| 2:08:47| and I just want to tell you all that I'm very proud to be part of South Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7727)|
| 2:08:51| and proud that we have this many people willing to step up and serve our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7731)|
| 2:08:56| I think that's something to be very proud of, that we have that active of a community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7736)|
| 2:09:00| but tonight I am here to speak for Victoria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7740)|
| 2:09:03| I'm very proud of what she has been doing for us as part of the homeowners association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7743)|
| 2:09:08| I think she has represented us very well and done her homework.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7748)|
| 2:09:11| I think that you all have all been witness to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7751)|
| 2:09:14| the fact that she has put her time in and done the research| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7754)|
| 2:09:17| and not just shot things straight off the top of her head, but she's prepared herself very well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7757)|
| 2:09:23| and I just think that she would be the best person to serve us at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7763)|
| 2:09:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7768)|
| 2:09:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7769)|
| 2:09:34| Howdy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7774)|
| 2:09:35| Hey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7775)|
| 2:09:37| My name is Angel Martinez, and I'm fairly new to South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7777)|
| 2:09:41| I've lived in South Knoxville at 1911 Stock Creek Road, and I just like Victoria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7781)|
| 2:09:54| There are just so many reasons for you to support her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7794)|
| 2:09:56| I think it's just a no-brainer, but I'm just excited about the passion of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7796)|
| 2:10:01| I'm very excited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7801)|
| 2:10:02| I'm married into East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7802)|
| 2:10:07| I've come to know a lot of the people in South Knoxville primarily through my job as a branch manager| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7807)|
| 2:10:11| at the SunTrust Bank inside the Chapman Square Kroger in the corner of Young High and Chapman Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7811)|
| 2:10:18| and I have come to find that I'm related by marriage to at least every tenth person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7818)|
| 2:10:24| because my wife is a tar water and a rule, and somehow everyone's kind of got some tar water rule in their blood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7824)|
| 2:10:33| It's a very eclectic, diverse group of folks, and it seems Victoria knows also a good tenth of the people there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7833)|
| 2:10:43| either through marriage or her doership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7843)|
| 2:10:46| She is a doer, and then she is just darn smart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7846)|
| 2:10:50| I mean, cooler talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7850)|
| 2:10:52| You don't talk about finger annexation and site plan and spot zoning, but she goes to sleep, and it's in her head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7852)|
| 2:11:01| She is a preparer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7861)|
| 2:11:03| She's detail-oriented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7863)|
| 2:11:04| She's a doer, and she questions, you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7864)|
| 2:11:08| Someone just gives her something, and she doesn't just take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7868)|
| 2:11:12| She goes, well, why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7872)|
| 2:11:14| And so I just have a lot of respect for her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7874)|
| 2:11:17| I've been to her house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7877)|
| 2:11:18| I've bonfired her house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7878)|
| 2:11:19| I know her kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7879)|
| 2:11:21| We homeschool three boys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7881)|
| 2:11:23| Her kids are just wonderfully behaved, but crazy kids at the same time I love| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7883)|
| 2:11:29| because they've got passion in them just like she does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7889)|
| 2:11:33| Please get her in here because I'd love to have her passion support South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7893)|
| 2:11:38| I think she's just a great choice, and I'm just very excited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7898)|
| 2:11:41| And then she's a woman too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7901)|
| 2:11:45| We need some representation, you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7905)|
| 2:11:49| We need some more diversity there, so I'm just very excited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7909)|
| 2:11:55| Anyway, get her in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7915)|
| 2:11:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7918)|
| 2:11:59| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7919)|
| 2:12:05| Yes, from what I heard, I guess Mr. Brown and Mr. Rose are glad she didn't run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7925)|
| 2:12:13| Is there anyone else from the 9th District that would like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7933)|
| 2:12:21| Ruthie, you have to get a permit to move over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7941)|
| 2:12:25| We have to vote on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7945)|
| 2:12:28| I would like to say, Tank, I believe everybody's through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7948)|
| 2:12:33| Are they through speaking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7953)|
| 2:12:34| I think is everyone finished?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7954)|
| 2:12:35| No one else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7955)|
| 2:12:37| I'd like to thank the audience for coming tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7957)|
| 2:12:39| Tank, I would like to thank everybody in South Knoxville for putting their name in as being here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7959)|
| 2:12:45| And I'm sort of in a hot seat here because I know every one of these people personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7965)|
| 2:12:50| I mean, friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7970)|
| 2:12:53| I don't know what I'm going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7973)|
| 2:12:54| I'm going to be here until the 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7974)|
| 2:12:56| Tank, before you close the meeting, I just wanted to say I've sat through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7976)|
| 2:13:03| This is the third meeting that we've had to have candidates come before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7983)|
| 2:13:10| I think in some cases we may be looking at the possibility of a primary winner getting the appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=7990)|
| 2:13:20| In other cases, I think we're going to have a caretaker in the appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=8000)|
| 2:13:27| But one thing I've noticed is the quality of the candidates that have stepped forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=8007)|
| 2:13:32| I've been truly, truly impressed by every single one of them, either by their experiences, their passion, and their knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=8012)|
| 2:13:42| And I think every commissioner up here would agree that we have a very difficult task before us in this selection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=8022)|
| 2:13:51| But one thing I do want to ask all of Knox Countians is that whomever we end up selecting to serve on this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=8031)|
| 2:14:00| especially those that end up being caretakers, we have some very major issues coming before this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=8040)|
| 2:14:10| And they're going to need your support, although they were not elected by the citizens of this great county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=8050)|
| 2:14:19| And we need to come together as a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=8059)|
| 2:14:24| And that's what I want to try to accomplish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=8064)|
| 2:14:27| And I know that's what they want to accomplish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=8067)|
| 2:14:30| And I just want to say again how proud I am of all the people that have stepped forward and offered their names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=8070)|
| 2:14:36| And please, please don't take if you don't get it as a reason to step back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=8076)|
| 2:14:42| Stay involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=8082)|
| 2:14:45| Keep us accountable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=8085)|
| 2:14:47| And, you know, try again because I thank a lot of every single person that came forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=8087)|
| 2:14:55| And I appreciate you putting your name forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=8095)|
| 2:14:58| I would just add to that that I think we have discovered a tremendous pool of talent for things like boards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=8098)|
| 2:15:06| and commissions and other appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=8106)|
| 2:15:08| So even those persons who do not get the appointments, I hope we remember some of the folks we saw| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=8108)|
| 2:15:14| and consider them when those boards and commissions and other appointments come before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=8114)|
| 2:15:21| Mr. Chairman, I'd like to say one thing, too, also to all of these applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=8121)|
| 2:15:27| There is not a single one of you that I've heard that I would not be completely comfortable with you being on this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=8127)|
| 2:15:36| And I appreciate Martin Pleasant and his comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=8136)|
| 2:15:42| I thought we were going to have a group hug before we got out of here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=8142)|
| 2:15:47| I don't think we will have one, but we're a little better off because of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=8147)|
| 2:15:52| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=8152)|
| 2:15:55| Anyone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=8155)|
| 2:15:57| To my commissioners, we meet again Saturday morning at 10 o'clock in the main assembly room for the fee offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=8157)|
| 2:16:03| And then we will meet again after intergovernmental and finance to wrap up everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=8163)|
| 2:16:12| See you, brother.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=8172)|
| 2:16:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=8202)|
| 2:17:12| Good to see you, Tom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=8232)|
| 2:17:38| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=8258)|
| 2:18:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=8288)|
| 2:18:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080213candidateforum?start=8318)|
