| 0:00:00| County Commission workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=0)|
| 0:00:03| And to our commissioners and our board members on commission, I would like to, if it's okay with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3)|
| 0:00:13| this month some of you are aware that my family is experiencing a death of my mother-in-law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=13)|
| 0:00:20| We're right in the middle of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=20)|
| 0:00:22| She could die at any moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=22)|
| 0:00:25| And so, given that, I thought that this month, rather than jump up and drop something on Larry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=25)|
| 0:00:32| on our vice chair who has been gracious enough to accept the responsibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=32)|
| 0:00:37| it might be wise for me to just serve as vice and let Larry chair this meeting and chair the other meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=37)|
| 0:00:45| That way he can prep for the other meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=45)|
| 0:00:47| If there's no objection to that, we'll proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=47)|
| 0:00:52| Any objection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=52)|
| 0:00:54| So, I'll be in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=54)|
| 0:00:57| We'll just switch seats, in effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=57)|
| 0:00:59| So, thank you all for that consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=59)|

| 0:01:08| We'll start our meeting with the pledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=68)|
| 0:01:09| And we'd like to ask Commissioner Dave Wright, former veteran, if you will lead us in the pledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=69)|
| 0:01:14| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=74)|
| 0:01:15| I ask that everyone stand, please, and give proper consideration to our country's flag| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=75)|
| 0:01:20| and join in the Pledge of Allegiance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=80)|
| 0:01:22| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=82)|
| 0:01:27| and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=87)|
| 0:01:32| indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=92)|

| 0:02:04| Thank you, Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=124)|
| 0:02:05| I have a consent agenda, and we'll start with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=125)|
| 0:02:21| One through 29.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=141)|
| 0:02:22| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=142)|
| 0:02:25| You like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=145)|
| 0:02:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=146)|
| 0:02:27| Number eight, number nine, number 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=147)|
| 0:02:50| 19, 20, 22, 23, 24, and 26.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=170)|
| 0:03:06| Are there any others to be added or pulled off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=186)|
| 0:03:10| Mr. Chairman, I need to pull eight off the consent because I need to abstain from the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=190)|
| 0:03:16| Which one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=196)|
| 0:03:18| Could you give us a second to go through these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=198)|
| 0:03:27| I'd like to discuss number nine as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=207)|
| 0:03:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=215)|
| 0:03:42| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=222)|
| 0:03:43| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=223)|
| 0:03:44| Mr. Chairman, do we have any discussion items for today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=224)|
| 0:03:48| I do not have any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=228)|
| 0:03:50| Clerk, do you have any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=230)|
| 0:03:52| Jolie, did you have any submitted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=232)|
| 0:03:55| Would you like to add one, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=235)|
| 0:03:58| When's the next discussion of the insolvency board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=238)|
| 0:04:03| The insolvency board met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=243)|
| 0:04:05| Should it be making some kind of like information back to full commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=245)|
| 0:04:11| Can I speak to that real quick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=251)|
| 0:04:13| I think what the meeting was to verify something that had already been voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=253)|
| 0:04:19| And so there's really nothing to bring back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=259)|
| 0:04:21| Well, they had to bring back the we already voted on the disposition of those properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=261)|
| 0:04:25| And so I had to bring that back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=265)|
| 0:04:27| We went backwards this time on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=267)|
| 0:04:29| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=269)|
| 0:04:30| What I was really thinking of was the discussion about the proposals for how would property be disposed of in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=270)|
| 0:04:38| There was some other action that took place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=278)|
| 0:04:41| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=281)|
| 0:04:42| That had already been voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=282)|
| 0:04:43| I mean, that has already been discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=283)|
| 0:04:45| And we had already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=285)|
| 0:04:46| It's huge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=286)|
| 0:04:47| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=287)|
| 0:04:48| I think that was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=288)|
| 0:04:49| That's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=289)|
| 0:04:50| We're just going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=290)|
| 0:04:51| We're just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=291)|
| 0:04:52| Solvency was going after the fact that commissions of current vote on that already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=292)|
| 0:04:54| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=294)|
| 0:04:55| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=295)|
| 0:04:56| Is that something that's going to be before one of the commission launches in the next month or so?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=296)|
| 0:05:02| The delinquent tax attorney speaking the same?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=302)|
| 0:05:05| We can certainly do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=305)|
| 0:05:06| No, I mean, is that happening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=306)|
| 0:05:09| No, I don't think anything was planned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=309)|
| 0:05:10| I think what the next action was, was after the RFP, they would come back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=310)|
| 0:05:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=317)|
| 0:05:18| We're waiting on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=318)|
| 0:05:19| That's my.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=319)|
| 0:05:20| That's where I just wanted to make sure where we were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=320)|
| 0:05:21| The other thing is the Audit Committee met this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=321)|
| 0:05:24| Would we, Commissioner Shouse, need to make any comments to the Audit Committee, to full commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=324)|
| 0:05:31| Do we need to think about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=331)|
| 0:05:33| To go over what we.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=333)|
| 0:05:34| Sure, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=334)|
| 0:05:36| We'll do that at discussion time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=336)|
| 0:05:40| We'll add that after ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=340)|
| 0:05:46| And who will discuss that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=346)|
| 0:05:47| Will Ed do that or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=347)|
| 0:05:51| Or both of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=351)|
| 0:05:52| Both of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=352)|
| 0:05:53| Myself and Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=353)|
| 0:05:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=354)|
| 0:05:55| I've got it listed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=355)|
| 0:05:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=356)|
| 0:05:58| Anything else to be added or deleted at this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=358)|
| 0:06:03| I move that we accept the consent agenda items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=363)|
| 0:06:09| Do I hear a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=369)|

| 0:08:09| Thompson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=489)|
| 0:08:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=490)|
| 0:08:11| And then I was looking for help from Ms. Broyles and Mr. Briggs also on the ad hoc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=491)|
| 0:08:21| So those were the names that I thought would be appropriate for that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=501)|
| 0:08:30| So, Gross, Thompson, Briggs, and Broyles serving on this ad hoc to address the issue of composition of the Ethics Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=510)|
| 0:08:43| Is that your motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=523)|
| 0:08:45| That's my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=525)|
| 0:08:46| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=526)|
| 0:08:47| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=527)|
| 0:08:48| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=528)|
| 0:08:49| So, a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=529)|
| 0:08:50| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=530)|
| 0:08:51| McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=531)|
| 0:08:52| Just Commissioner Norman, are we positive that there is not Thomas and not Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=532)|
| 0:08:57| I would hate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=537)|
| 0:08:58| Thompson has the name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=538)|
| 0:09:01| Are you pretty confident that I would have to have to come back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=541)|
| 0:09:04| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=544)|
| 0:09:05| I'm not absolutely sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=545)|
| 0:09:07| Well, we can find out by next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=547)|
| 0:09:09| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=549)|
| 0:09:12| Who's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=552)|
| 0:09:13| Commissioner Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=553)|
| 0:09:14| Or Sam?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=554)|
| 0:09:18| That's my line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=558)|
| 0:09:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=559)|
| 0:09:21| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=561)|
| 0:09:22| We're a little mixed up here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=562)|
| 0:09:23| All righty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=563)|
| 0:09:26| I've e-mailed you on this, and according to the Institute of Internal Auditor Standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=566)|
| 0:09:33| periodically we're required to evaluate the Ethics Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=573)|
| 0:09:39| And, you know, seeing that we're setting up this ad hoc committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=579)|
| 0:09:43| I thought it would be a good time to go ahead and do this evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=583)|
| 0:09:47| Now, of course, this won't only be looking at the Ethics Committee that's a component of the Ethics Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=587)|
| 0:09:53| It will be looking at the entire Ethics Program for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=593)|
| 0:09:57| And I spoke before the Ethics Committee Friday and the Audit Committee this morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=597)|
| 0:10:04| and there did not appear to be any objection to doing this, I guess in concert with this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=604)|
| 0:10:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=612)|
| 0:10:13| So could we add that process as a friendly amendment to these names?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=613)|
| 0:10:20| That would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=620)|
| 0:10:21| Is that okay with you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=621)|
| 0:10:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=622)|
| 0:10:23| Any objection there to the second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=623)|
| 0:10:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=625)|
| 0:10:26| And the names, again, were Ken Gross.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=626)|
| 0:10:29| The last name was Thompson of the man that's already on Ethics, on the Ethics Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=629)|
| 0:10:37| Bob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=637)|
| 0:10:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=638)|
| 0:10:39| Bob Thompson, Rick Briggs, and Amy Bross would be the composition of it, plus the friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=639)|
| 0:10:52| Clerk, if you'll read the friendly amendment so we'll know what we're voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=652)|
| 0:10:58| Or just restate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=658)|
| 0:10:59| Restate that for us, Richard, what your process is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=659)|
| 0:11:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=662)|
| 0:11:03| The audit activity is required to periodically evaluate the Ethics Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=663)|
| 0:11:12| So if we could just add that as an additional, I guess, objective of this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=672)|
| 0:11:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=680)|
| 0:11:21| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=681)|

| 0:15:39| investment grade audit of our HVAC equipment and our utilities and the like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=939)|
| 0:15:45| and to then work with us in order to finance new equipment that will be more energy efficient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=945)|
| 0:15:52| and to help us finance that over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=952)|
| 0:15:54| So it's basically a self-funding program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=954)|
| 0:15:58| We use the savings in utilities over a period of 15 years to fund the new equipment that goes into our buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=958)|
| 0:16:05| and makes them more energy efficient in the short term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=965)|
| 0:16:08| And so this is, as I said, the fourth phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=968)|
| 0:16:11| And we've gone through this process for several groups of our schools now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=971)|
| 0:16:18| And we anticipate, I think, one more phase after this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=978)|
| 0:16:21| But it's been a very good partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=981)|
| 0:16:24| It has been the Train Corporation has done what they said they were going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=984)|
| 0:16:28| They've helped us put in place new energy efficient equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=988)|
| 0:16:32| And where the savings hasn't been realized right away, and there's been one instance where it hasn't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=992)|
| 0:16:37| they've written us a check, as they are guaranteed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=997)|
| 0:16:40| So we're very pleased with the program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1000)|
| 0:16:42| and the Board of Education has approved this Phase 3B of the train program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1002)|
| 0:16:48| So is this looking at additional schools or additional improvements in the same schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1008)|
| 0:16:54| Additional school, an additional set of schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1014)|
| 0:16:56| And then my last question is, and I know Train wouldn't do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1016)|
| 0:17:01| but are there any things on your books to look at another utility such as water usage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1021)|
| 0:17:09| and things like that in terms of flush valves and things of that nature?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1029)|
| 0:17:15| You know, Owen Nevator is here from Train.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1035)|
| 0:17:17| He can maybe give you a better sense of the comprehensive nature of what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1037)|
| 0:17:21| But a lot of it is HVAC equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1041)|
| 0:17:23| Lighting is also a pretty significant component of what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1043)|
| 0:17:27| But in terms of a detailed question like that, I'll defer to him, if that's okay with the Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1047)|
| 0:17:32| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1052)|
| 0:17:34| Thank you, Dr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1054)|
| 0:17:35| Owen Nevator with Train, 5220 Middlebrook Pike South here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1055)|
| 0:17:41| Commissioner McKenzie, yes, the program covers all of the consumables, all of the utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1061)|
| 0:17:48| And so, for instance, in not only the Knox County government facilities, but in all the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1068)|
| 0:17:56| all the plumbing fixtures, lighting fixtures, you know, air conditioning equipment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1076)|
| 0:18:00| anything that consumes electric, gas, oil, water, wastewater is included in the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1080)|
| 0:18:06| And as Dr. McIntyre stated earlier, and we guarantee the results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1086)|
| 0:18:11| It's a performance-based guarantee consistent with the RFQ and terms that purchasing did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1091)|
| 0:18:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1098)|
| 0:18:19| So, even in Phases 1 through 3A, there's been the other utilities have been part of those programs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1099)|
| 0:18:26| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1106)|
| 0:18:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1107)|
| 0:18:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1108)|
| 0:18:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1109)|
| 0:18:30| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1110)|
| 0:18:31| Mr. Autor and Dr. McIntyre, a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1111)|
| 0:18:34| You talked about they were doing the financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1114)|
| 0:18:36| Can you explain a little bit of the financing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1116)|
| 0:18:38| How's that versus working with Train versus going on the open market?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1118)|
| 0:18:43| What kind of a?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1123)|
| 0:18:44| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1124)|
| 0:18:45| Basically, we work with your purchasing group and your finance group to do the preliminary cash flow analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1125)|
| 0:18:53| And then, in every case so far, Knox County Finance and Purchasing has, in fact, gone on the open market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1133)|
| 0:19:00| and funded the projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1140)|
| 0:19:02| And so, typically, when we run the cash flow models and we set all of the contract parameters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1142)|
| 0:19:09| we're doing that off of conservative, what they call indicative rates from the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1149)|
| 0:19:13| And, you know, we don't participate in any of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1153)|
| 0:19:16| So, for instance, if we model it, you know, a 4% or 2.75% and Knox County actually secures funding at 2.25%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1156)|
| 0:19:24| that's just all the better to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1164)|
| 0:19:27| Is that the first check you've written back to Knox County because the guarantee did not happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1167)|
| 0:19:31| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1171)|
| 0:19:32| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1172)|
| 0:19:33| So, in short order, we've done four projects, three with schools and one with the county government facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1173)|
| 0:19:40| The first group of schools that we did, you know, just being blunt, we probably were a little aggressive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1180)|
| 0:19:48| in getting used to some very stringent terms issued by Knox County Purchasing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1188)|
| 0:19:53| very, very different than standard performance contracting terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1193)|
| 0:19:57| And so, that first set of schools, it's been tough for us, and we've had to reinvest in those schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1197)|
| 0:20:02| We've written, I believe, three checks so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1202)|
| 0:20:05| And I think about this time last year, I told you I hope we weren't going to write another one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1205)|
| 0:20:11| I think right now the shortfall on that phase of schools is down to like a $7,000 figure in a 12-month period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1211)|
| 0:20:18| So, we've consistently, you know, worked away at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1218)|
| 0:20:22| Dr. McIntyre, I'm well pleased with Dr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1222)|
| 0:20:24| I think it's a good deal and trains to be committed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1224)|
| 0:20:27| You've done a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1227)|
| 0:20:28| Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1228)|
| 0:20:31| The next item is on page 6, item number 21, resolution 801.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1231)|
| 0:20:38| It's approving a defined services contract in the amount of $500,000 with the Knoxville-Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1238)|
| 0:20:44| Community Action Committee, CAC, for senior transportation services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1244)|
| 0:20:50| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1250)|
| 0:20:52| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1252)|
| 0:20:53| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1253)|
| 0:20:55| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1255)|
| 0:20:56| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1256)|
| 0:20:57| Just a couple of questions with regards to the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1257)|
| 0:21:07| Could you fill us in, Mr. Holt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1267)|
| 0:21:08| This is Hugh Holt, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1268)|
| 0:21:10| What is your address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1270)|
| 0:21:11| Hugh Holt, 1000 North Central Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1271)|
| 0:21:13| Who all applied for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1273)|
| 0:21:16| We only had one bidder, and it was CAC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1276)|
| 0:21:19| We had a couple of other interested agencies, but they decided not to submit a proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1279)|
| 0:21:26| With regards to the monies, this goes into effect December the 1st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1286)|
| 0:21:31| so there will be seven months remaining in this fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1291)|
| 0:21:34| If the money isn't spent, can it be rolled over to the next year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1294)|
| 0:21:38| Or how will it be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1298)|
| 0:21:39| Just so I'm clear on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1299)|
| 0:21:41| I would defer the finance accounting questions to Mr. Caldwell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1301)|
| 0:21:46| but this is a monthly reimbursable contract not to exceed $500,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1306)|
| 0:21:52| And there's probably a good opportunity for them not to meet that amount of expenditure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1312)|
| 0:21:59| Can someone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1319)|
| 0:22:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1323)|
| 0:22:04| Thank you, Hugh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1324)|
| 0:22:12| Chris Caldwell, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1332)|
| 0:22:15| We could roll that over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1335)|
| 0:22:16| Once we get to the year end and we see how our revenues and expenditures are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1336)|
| 0:22:22| then we can talk more then, but that is something that can be rolled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1342)|
| 0:22:25| That's what I was asking because let's say for whatever reason they get into it and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1345)|
| 0:22:29| I mean, if the money is there, I don't want them to feel that, oh, gosh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1349)|
| 0:22:33| we have to spend this money if it can be rolled over into the next fiscal year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1353)|
| 0:22:36| because we've only got seven months left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1356)|
| 0:22:38| So as long as we have that understanding, I think this is a good contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1358)|
| 0:22:42| Commissioner, that was my same concerns, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1362)|
| 0:22:45| Chris, hold on just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1365)|
| 0:22:47| Ed, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1367)|
| 0:22:49| So is it the intent that it be $71,000 a month then and not annualized because of where we are in time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1369)|
| 0:22:59| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1379)|
| 0:23:00| And my understanding is they're going to get reimbursed on a per ride basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1380)|
| 0:23:04| So once that amount is done, then that would end up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1384)|
| 0:23:08| So they may spend it beforehand or if it goes further and they need some more time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1388)|
| 0:23:13| and it's something that the commission would like to designate to roll over, then that can be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1393)|
| 0:23:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1398)|
| 0:23:19| So, I mean, just looking going forward if this, I know we said this wasn't ongoing or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1399)|
| 0:23:25| but if the money were here a year from now, it would be more like in the $40,000 a month instead of $71,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1405)|
| 0:23:31| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1411)|
| 0:23:32| So we'll get the potential for a lot more transportation now than possibly next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1412)|
| 0:23:37| Am I reading that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1417)|
| 0:23:38| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1418)|
| 0:23:39| I mean, we can for sure designate that money to roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1419)|
| 0:23:42| They don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1422)|
| 0:23:43| If we get to June the 30th and they've spent $375,000 and have $125,000 left of the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1423)|
| 0:23:52| so desires for that to be rolled, then we can roll that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1432)|
| 0:23:55| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1435)|
| 0:23:57| Any other questions for Chris?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1437)|
| 0:23:59| Chris, I'd like to see if we could at a workshop, February, March, whatever, give us a graph| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1439)|
| 0:24:03| and sort of see where we are, how we're coming with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1443)|
| 0:24:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1448)|
| 0:24:09| Are we ready to vote on the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1449)|

| 0:24:16| Commissioners, we need to go back to item number nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1456)|
| 0:24:18| We got so excited we were getting a refund check we forgot to vote on item number nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1458)|
| 0:24:24| We had a motion and a second, but we did not vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1464)|
| 0:24:28| Any other discussion on item number nine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1468)|

| 0:24:48| Resolution 903 is number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1488)|
| 0:24:51| It's directing the Knox County Finance Director to subject to Knoxville City Council's action of saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1491)|
| 0:24:56| put a hold on implementing the city county building garage monthly parking rate increase effective January 1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1496)|
| 0:25:03| 2013 to $60 for Knox County employees paying the full rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1503)|
| 0:25:08| and $30 for those employees paying the 50% rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1508)|
| 0:25:12| And number two, requesting city county PBA parking committee to reconvene subject to Knoxville City Council's action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1512)|
| 0:25:19| of saying as recommended in the city county PBA parking committee report dated May 18,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1519)|
| 0:25:25| 2010 to review the parking rate and structure and other matters affecting parking policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1525)|
| 0:25:31| and submit its findings and recommendations to the county commission, city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1531)|
| 0:25:36| board of education, and PBA board of directors for their consideration and approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1536)|
| 0:25:43| A motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1543)|
| 0:25:44| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1544)|
| 0:25:45| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1545)|
| 0:25:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1546)|
| 0:25:47| Discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1547)|
| 0:25:48| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1548)|
| 0:25:49| Yeah, Chris, didn't the mayor, has he met with Mayor O'Hara?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1549)|
| 0:25:52| Did they have a discussion about what they wanted to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1552)|
| 0:25:54| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1554)|
| 0:25:55| Going back to I think we discussed this some during last month's meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1555)|
| 0:26:01| what would be recommended is just to withdraw this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1561)|
| 0:26:07| Both mayors have agreed to suspend the rate increase for six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1567)|
| 0:26:13| We're going to get our salary survey back in the meantime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1573)|
| 0:26:16| And then both mayors will then decide, let's say June or July, what to do with the rates at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1576)|
| 0:26:24| I'd like to make a motion we table this until next July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1584)|
| 0:26:27| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1587)|
| 0:26:28| A substitute motion, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1588)|
| 0:26:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1590)|
| 0:26:32| Table it until July of next year, until they figure out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1592)|
| 0:26:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1595)|
| 0:26:36| Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1596)|
| 0:26:37| Or I'm changing my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1597)|
| 0:26:38| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1598)|
| 0:26:39| I want to table it as long as both mayors agree to suspend the increase and we bring it back in July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1599)|
| 0:26:45| You want to table or defer it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1605)|
| 0:26:48| Six and a half dozen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1608)|
| 0:26:49| I guess with the table, someone will have to bring it forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1609)|
| 0:26:53| So I kind of like the table piece of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1613)|
| 0:26:56| Someone would need to bring it back forward if we tabled it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1616)|
| 0:26:59| So I think that would be prudent, personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1619)|
| 0:27:04| I'll table it pending the both mayors agreeing to suspend it for six months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1624)|
| 0:27:08| and we figure out what the salary survey looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1628)|
| 0:27:10| The second agrees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1630)|
| 0:27:11| The second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1631)|
| 0:27:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1632)|
| 0:27:13| Discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1633)|
| 0:27:14| Mr. McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1634)|
| 0:27:15| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1635)|
| 0:27:16| And I guess my --I agree with Brad 100% on what's above there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1636)|
| 0:27:21| So the piece that I want to just put out there is food for thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1641)|
| 0:27:25| And we'll have six months to think about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1645)|
| 0:27:28| Because, you know, and I know that this was kind of a hot and heavy issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1648)|
| 0:27:32| and they had a lot of things to churn through when the committee met with PBA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1652)|
| 0:27:36| and the city and the county and everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1656)|
| 0:27:39| But an annual review, I think, is a little too frequent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1659)|
| 0:27:43| So I would just as food for thought, we may want to revisit an annual review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1663)|
| 0:27:50| Because once things get settled, I don't see parking rates going up or down annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1670)|
| 0:27:56| It's been a while since they've gone up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1676)|
| 0:27:58| And I don't see the garage changing much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1678)|
| 0:28:00| We're not adding spots or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1680)|
| 0:28:02| So I guess once we get things settled, I'd ask us to reconsider that annual review to another review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1682)|
| 0:28:10| that may not be as frequent as a yearly review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1690)|
| 0:28:13| That's just a lot of work for a lot of people to get together for an annual review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1693)|
| 0:28:17| Chris, you have something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1697)|
| 0:28:18| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1698)|
| 0:28:19| Commissioner McKenzie, Dale Smith, who is over at PBA, came last month and basically said his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1699)|
| 0:28:28| recommendation would be not to reconvene the parking committee unless it's so desired later on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1708)|
| 0:28:36| Because basically the committee agreed to do certain things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1716)|
| 0:28:39| And from now on it's basically at the direction of both mayors on what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1719)|
| 0:28:45| So he looks for them to make recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1725)|
| 0:28:50| And as long as they agree, then we're great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1730)|
| 0:28:52| If there's not an agreement, then the status quo stays in act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1732)|
| 0:28:56| I think his recommendation was not to reconvene unless something urgent happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1736)|
| 0:29:01| or something that was considered a major action needs to be taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1741)|
| 0:29:05| Well, that's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1745)|
| 0:29:06| So I guess whenever this comes back before that will be reflected in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1746)|
| 0:29:10| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1750)|
| 0:29:13| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1753)|
| 0:29:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1754)|
| 0:29:15| So, Brad, this doesn't include that this committee is going to meet, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1755)|
| 0:29:21| You're just going to leave it up to both the mayors to decide what's going to happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1761)|
| 0:29:24| I'll be honest with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1764)|
| 0:29:24| The history of that committee is they thoroughly vetted everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1764)|
| 0:29:27| And I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1767)|
| 0:29:28| Nothing's changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1768)|
| 0:29:29| There's not been a status change in the security, the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1769)|
| 0:29:33| I mean, actually the cost of opening the garage would go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1773)|
| 0:29:35| So I don't see a point in meeting that committee, reconvening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1775)|
| 0:29:39| There's about It took a lot of man hours from the police fire or the police and the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1779)|
| 0:29:44| and the county and the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1784)|
| 0:29:47| It's the decisions are prudent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1787)|
| 0:29:49| And I don't I just don't think there need to be reconvening that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1789)|
| 0:29:52| My concern is that there were several things in the recommendations that they made that weren't followed through on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1792)|
| 0:30:00| And so those things, I think, need to be addressed by this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1800)|
| 0:30:03| I understand that Dale doesn't want to participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1803)|
| 0:30:06| And if he doesn't, I think that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1806)|
| 0:30:07| We can get somebody else from PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1807)|
| 0:30:09| If the people who are part of this committee no longer want to be, I think it's perfectly plausible that we can find other people who are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1809)|
| 0:30:19| The parking rates were set by a committee of employees and citizens, and I would like for it to remain that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1819)|
| 0:30:26| I'm not willing to just turn it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1826)|
| 0:30:28| I mean, I'm happy to, you know, withdraw it and not do anything, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1828)|
| 0:30:32| and let them as long as the mayors are in agreement that we're going to postpone it until the salary survey is done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1832)|
| 0:30:37| But at that point, I think that it needs to be a committee of employees and citizens who make that decision, not the two mayors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1837)|
| 0:30:44| Well, and we can readdress it in July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1844)|
| 0:30:46| I just think that it's I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1846)|
| 0:30:47| Well, I think that it probably needs to be going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1847)|
| 0:30:49| It needs to be happening before July because that's when we're going to start, you know, if there are going to be raises given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1849)|
| 0:30:55| I think that it's the same thing with doing the salary survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1855)|
| 0:30:58| They need a far enough head start to get the information vetted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1858)|
| 0:31:03| and make whatever recommendations they want to make before such a time as we decide on if they're going to be raises or not or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1863)|
| 0:31:12| That needs to be folded into that whole process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1872)|
| 0:31:17| So I would like to say that the committee, and they don't need to meet annually hereafter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1877)|
| 0:31:25| but based on the fact that there were things that the committee recommended that were not done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1885)|
| 0:31:32| and that the committee is made up of stakeholders, employees, and citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1892)|
| 0:31:40| I think it's wisest to allow that committee to meet and come to a determination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1900)|
| 0:31:50| Mr. Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1910)|
| 0:31:53| Was it Mr. Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1913)|
| 0:31:54| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1914)|
| 0:31:56| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1916)|
| 0:31:57| I think it's helpful to go back and look at why we had this committee in the very beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1917)|
| 0:32:00| And Mr. Walls was very involved in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1920)|
| 0:32:03| The opening up of the parking garage to the public was not the primary issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1923)|
| 0:32:06| That was a secondary issue, and I believe you were on that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1926)|
| 0:32:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1929)|
| 0:32:10| As I recall, one of the reasons why we convened this committee was because we had so many people in this building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1930)|
| 0:32:15| that weren't paying at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1935)|
| 0:32:17| We had a number of badges that were out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1937)|
| 0:32:20| There was questions as to whether or not we could fully account for who had a badge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1940)|
| 0:32:25| and who had access to the garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1945)|
| 0:32:27| I mean, those were some of the security issues, as I recall, that this committee was charged with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1947)|
| 0:32:31| And then it was how much do you pay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1951)|
| 0:32:35| And so there was a lot involved in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1955)|
| 0:32:38| It wasn't, you know, just one phase thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1958)|
| 0:32:41| I think it's helpful to come back and look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1961)|
| 0:32:43| I will support Mr. Andrews' resolution that we let the mayors take a look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1963)|
| 0:32:50| But I also think it's helpful, too, that we go back and we make sure that we're not slipping back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1970)|
| 0:32:54| into some of the things that we were doing which necessitated this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1974)|
| 0:32:59| and that is making sure that everything is being properly done, that people are paying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1979)|
| 0:33:04| that you don't have a number of people, because of who they know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1984)|
| 0:33:07| are not paying for the privilege to park in this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1987)|
| 0:33:12| And so I would agree with Ms. Broyles that it's a good idea to revisit this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1992)|
| 0:33:18| maybe to not the extent that we did before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=1998)|
| 0:33:20| But I think it is helpful, again, just to realize why we convened this in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2000)|
| 0:33:24| We were having a lot of issues, and I think a lot of those issues were addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2004)|
| 0:33:27| and we're a lot better now than we were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2007)|
| 0:33:29| And so I would be in favor of going ahead and let's let the mayors take a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2009)|
| 0:33:34| And then let's take a look at it again in a few months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2014)|
| 0:33:36| and then see if we need to maybe do another committee to just take a look at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2016)|
| 0:33:42| and make sure that we are doing the things that we do and address some of these other issues that were brought up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2022)|
| 0:33:46| that maybe haven't been addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2026)|
| 0:33:48| Mr. Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2028)|
| 0:33:49| Can that be addressed through the audit committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2029)|
| 0:33:51| Could the audit committee ask the auditor to look through the parking records?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2031)|
| 0:33:55| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2035)|
| 0:33:56| Mr. Walls, let me ask you, I know that you were very involved in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2036)|
| 0:33:58| and you had a lot of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2038)|
| 0:33:59| And so that would be something for him because, as I recall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2039)|
| 0:34:03| he presented a lot of the facts and information to the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2043)|
| 0:34:08| The audit committee meets again in January, and this could be put on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2048)|
| 0:34:17| Again, the audit committee is not a parking committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2057)|
| 0:34:20| It's an audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2060)|
| 0:34:22| And I don't have a problem with the audit committee requesting that Richard, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2062)|
| 0:34:26| compile all the information for us again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2066)|
| 0:34:29| But, again, this needs to be a committee of citizens and employees that make this determination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2069)|
| 0:34:36| As much as I, you know, like our two mayors, I don't think it's their place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2076)|
| 0:34:43| or responsibility to determine how much our employees pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2083)|
| 0:34:47| I think that should be up to a pretty broad committee to make that determination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2087)|
| 0:34:51| I also want to say that the feedback that I've gotten over the past month has been from people who say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2091)|
| 0:34:57| one email in particular says, you know, I pay $50 a month at the parking lot that I park in every day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2097)|
| 0:35:07| downtown, and I pay my employees parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2107)|
| 0:35:10| And I think that if our parking committee, looking back on the work that was done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2110)|
| 0:35:15| I don't think there was a sufficient study done of other private organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2115)|
| 0:35:23| and corporations located downtown, how much they pay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2123)|
| 0:35:26| and whether or not their employees' parking was covered under their benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2126)|
| 0:35:31| And I think that makes a tremendous difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2131)|
| 0:35:33| So we're looking at, you know, we were looking at increasing our employees' rate to $65 a month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2133)|
| 0:35:39| but we've got a private organization that's paying $50 a month for the principal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2139)|
| 0:35:45| and then covering their employees' parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2145)|
| 0:35:48| And those things need to be taken into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2148)|
| 0:35:51| And, again, I would like to see this addressed before budget time rolls around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2151)|
| 0:36:00| So I'm happy to support it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2160)|
| 0:36:02| But, Brad, I would ask that we bring this back up in January| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2162)|
| 0:36:06| and appoint a committee of citizens and employees to take a look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2166)|
| 0:36:12| I'm happy to leave it up to the mayors right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2172)|
| 0:36:15| But I think in January, when the audit committee talks to Richard about revisiting this information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2175)|
| 0:36:22| we need to have a committee of citizens and employees because they are the stakeholders in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2182)|
| 0:36:29| Commissioner Borges, we looked at what I was on the committee, as Commissioner Andrews said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2189)|
| 0:36:33| and we didn't look at what other corporations were doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2193)|
| 0:36:35| We looked at what the lots over here were doing, what the surrounding lots were paying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2195)|
| 0:36:40| what we were looking at, and we found that they were paying two and three times higher than what ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2200)|
| 0:36:47| Chris, did you have something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2207)|
| 0:36:48| You know, to address Commissioner Hammond, as far as looking and auditing the records,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2208)|
| 0:36:56| the parking records of individuals who park in here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2216)|
| 0:36:59| I do know that Jane Burrett from PBA does an outstanding job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2219)|
| 0:37:03| and her people are looking at that currently as we speak and going through a list daily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2223)|
| 0:37:10| of who is parking here and who shouldn't be parking here, and they're working on that as we speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2230)|
| 0:37:18| Commissioner Borges?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2238)|
| 0:37:19| Chris?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2239)|
| 0:37:20| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2240)|
| 0:37:21| Do you have any idea when your opinion from the AG is going to come down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2241)|
| 0:37:27| Do you have any idea about when that might happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2247)|
| 0:37:30| Yeah, it came down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2250)|
| 0:37:31| And not good news, I'm assuming?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2251)|
| 0:37:34| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2254)|
| 0:37:35| And I think that was kind of to be expected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2255)|
| 0:37:38| We can look at some other routes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2258)|
| 0:37:39| I know what McGee-Tyson Airport has done through a TCA code to be able to charge there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2259)|
| 0:37:47| And so we'll look at a couple of different options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2267)|
| 0:37:49| We're going to try to have a meeting with some of our legislative delegation to try to work through some of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2269)|
| 0:37:58| And that's another issue that we need this committee to look at is the number of handicap spaces we have available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2278)|
| 0:38:06| and how many handicap stickers we actually have out because they do not have to pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2286)|
| 0:38:13| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2293)|
| 0:38:14| They do at the airport, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2294)|
| 0:38:17| Commissioner Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2297)|
| 0:38:18| Would you explain exactly, you know, you've brought up the AG opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2298)|
| 0:38:22| I'm sure there are folks out there who are saying, what are they talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2302)|
| 0:38:25| What is this AG opinion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2305)|
| 0:38:26| Let's, if you would, explain exactly what we're talking about so everyone has the benefit of the knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2306)|
| 0:38:32| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2312)|
| 0:38:33| And I will say this, that it wasn't an official AG opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2313)|
| 0:38:37| They would say that we talked to an attorney in the AG's office and that person said it wasn't an official opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2317)|
| 0:38:43| It was just his opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2323)|
| 0:38:45| But, basically, there is a TCA code that says that a municipally owned parking structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2325)|
| 0:38:53| garage or parking lot cannot charge handicapped parkers to park in those particular spots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2333)|
| 0:39:04| And so, hence that happens here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2344)|
| 0:39:07| We know currently I think the county has 120 handicapped parkers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2347)|
| 0:39:13| The city has 12 now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2353)|
| 0:39:16| They had five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2356)|
| 0:39:17| They're up to 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2357)|
| 0:39:18| We're up to 120.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2358)|
| 0:39:20| And so we don't get revenue off those spots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2360)|
| 0:39:25| They get to park for free because of that TCA code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2365)|
| 0:39:30| The airport authority, through a TCA code that was modified, does charge handicapped for parking there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2370)|
| 0:39:39| And they are a subcomponent of the city in some way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2379)|
| 0:39:42| And so we can look at things like that to see what we can and can't do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2382)|
| 0:39:47| But, basically, it's just a TCA code that says if it's a municipally owned parking structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2387)|
| 0:39:55| you cannot charge to park for handicapped parkers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2395)|
| 0:40:01| So when you say municipally owned, not just in this building, but any in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2401)|
| 0:40:05| or county that may be municipally owned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2405)|
| 0:40:08| So any of the parking garages, for example, would come under that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2408)|
| 0:40:12| That would be my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2412)|
| 0:40:15| My argument was that this is a closed garage that isn't open to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2415)|
| 0:40:21| And I thought that TCA code structure was a code that was just for the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2421)|
| 0:40:28| But the public is everybody, which includes employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2428)|
| 0:40:34| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2434)|
| 0:40:35| Dale, could you come down real quick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2435)|
| 0:40:36| I have just one real quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2436)|
| 0:40:37| Amy Burrell has talked about the disability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2437)|
| 0:40:39| I've got one quick question I'd like to ask you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2439)|
| 0:40:53| I know you stated this a couple of years ago in the meeting about people on disability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2453)|
| 0:40:59| Let's say I break my leg and I'm out for six weeks or six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2459)|
| 0:41:03| How does PBA monitor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2463)|
| 0:41:06| Once you have that disability tag, as Commissioner Boyle said, it never goes away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2466)|
| 0:41:11| But how do you monitor short-term disability?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2471)|
| 0:41:15| Well, excuse me, it's very, very difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2475)|
| 0:41:19| We've tried on an annual basis to go back through them to make sure that people who had temporaries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2479)|
| 0:41:27| that they're no longer parking for free if the temporary period has expired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2487)|
| 0:41:33| But the difficulty is HIPAA law prevents us from asking any questions medically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2493)|
| 0:41:40| I mean, once a doctor has signed this form, there's nothing we can do about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2500)|
| 0:41:47| We are bound by state law not only not to charge them, but to let them in the garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2507)|
| 0:41:52| And that's a huge piece of why you have 120 handicapped employees is that they sort of have headline privileges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2512)|
| 0:42:02| They instantly have to be accommodated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2522)|
| 0:42:06| The other piece of that, and I'll tell you this from personal experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2526)|
| 0:42:11| I broke my leg a few years back goofing around with my family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2531)|
| 0:42:16| And I got a temporary handicap tag so that if I had to go, like, to Westtown Mall during the holiday period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2536)|
| 0:42:26| I didn't have to walk a mile and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2546)|
| 0:42:28| I kept paying for parking here, so I never used it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2548)|
| 0:42:32| And my doctor sent me the form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2552)|
| 0:42:34| He had signed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2554)|
| 0:42:36| But I'm the one that marked temporary or permanent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2556)|
| 0:42:39| And that will indicate to you how loose this system really is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2559)|
| 0:42:43| It's the doctors basically give them out any time anybody's got almost any kind of difficulty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2563)|
| 0:42:52| The employee could easily have done what I could have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2572)|
| 0:42:55| I could have DD plates on my car for the rest of my life if I had just checked the permanent box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2575)|
| 0:43:01| I feel like we're way out of line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2581)|
| 0:43:02| If the city has five and we've got 120, I just think, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2582)|
| 0:43:05| maybe something needs to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2585)|
| 0:43:06| Human resources need to maybe look into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2586)|
| 0:43:09| Well, but don't be careful what you ask them to do because the law there doesn't give you latitude to play physician.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2589)|
| 0:43:16| And that's the dilemma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2596)|
| 0:43:19| And it's also why, I mean, Chris and I, from almost the beginning of the parking committee, had discussed this problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2599)|
| 0:43:26| You remember the discussions about this problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2606)|
| 0:43:29| Minus some modification to that section of state law where we would all be walking on very dangerous water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2609)|
| 0:43:38| Because if you and I see somebody jogging up the ramp and go declare them not handicapped,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2618)|
| 0:43:45| but their physician has signed that form, guess who's going to win?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2625)|
| 0:43:49| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2629)|
| 0:43:50| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2630)|
| 0:43:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2631)|
| 0:43:52| We have a substitute motion, first and second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2632)|
| 0:43:55| Would you please read the substitute motion to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2635)|
| 0:43:59| It's on the table until both pending both mayors' agreement to suspend the January increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2639)|
| 0:44:09| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2649)|
| 0:44:10| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2650)|
| 0:44:12| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2652)|
| 0:44:13| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2653)|
| 0:44:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2654)|
| 0:44:15| Mr. Chair, could I clarify one thing said earlier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2655)|
| 0:44:17| And that was to Ms. Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2657)|
| 0:44:19| I did not say I didn't personally want to participate on the parking committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2659)|
| 0:44:24| I may have said something that anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2664)|
| 0:44:27| That was my clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2667)|
| 0:44:28| Everybody wanted to reconvene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2668)|
| 0:44:29| It was not very thoughtful, maybe, but it didn't mean I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2669)|
| 0:44:34| So that's don't misconstrue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2674)|
| 0:44:36| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2676)|
| 0:44:37| I was not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2677)|
| 0:44:38| That was my own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2678)|
| 0:44:39| I was thinking if I were you, I would not want to be on it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2679)|
| 0:44:42| Well, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2682)|
| 0:44:43| Whether I do or don't, I'm going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2683)|
| 0:44:45| So I guess it's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2685)|
| 0:44:46| No problem there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2686)|
| 0:44:47| Thanks, Dale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2687)|
| 0:44:49| Brad, they gave us on that committee, they gave us a notebook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2689)|
| 0:44:51| It was four to six inches thick of it, everybody that's on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2691)|
| 0:44:53| So to go through those and, I mean, they put a lot of work into that, working that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2693)|
| 0:45:00| Now let's move into our ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2700)|
| 0:45:02| Item number 27 is Ordinance 101 on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2702)|
| 0:45:07| It's amending Chapter 38, Article 2 of the Knox County Code entitled health department to establish a community health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2707)|
| 0:45:15| This amends Ordinance 0-96-3-102 adopted April 22nd, 1996, and adding a Division 2 to Knox County Code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2715)|
| 0:45:24| Chapter 38, Article 2, previously reserved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2724)|
| 0:45:29| Anybody from the mayor or health?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2729)|
| 0:45:30| Martha, do you want to speak on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2730)|
| 0:45:37| Martha Buchanan, 140 Dameron Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2737)|
| 0:45:40| This ordinance will establish a community health council here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2740)|
| 0:45:46| Tennessee Code allows for a community health council and a health board as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2746)|
| 0:45:52| They serve different functions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2752)|
| 0:45:53| The Board of Health votes on our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2753)|
| 0:45:57| Community health council is more advisory to the community and to us regarding issues of health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2757)|
| 0:46:04| Having it codified means it's going to live beyond my tenure at the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2764)|
| 0:46:11| And having this county mayor, county commission, city mayor, city council, Mayor Farragut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2771)|
| 0:46:20| and the aldermen, Board of Aldermen, all having appointments to this board just adds to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2780)|
| 0:46:26| And we're pretty excited about it, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2786)|
| 0:46:28| How many will each mayor appoint?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2788)|
| 0:46:30| Everybody has one appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2790)|
| 0:46:32| It will work like the tree board and or food policy council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2792)|
| 0:46:36| We'll forward recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2796)|
| 0:46:38| Certainly, if any one of you wanted to serve, that would be great, but each body will have one appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2798)|
| 0:46:44| And so those terms will rotate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2804)|
| 0:46:47| It's all figured out so they rotate on and off, and we'll be sure to bring folks forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2807)|
| 0:46:52| This will roll the current leadership team for Together Healthy Knox will be the initial community health council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2812)|
| 0:47:02| and then that will start the rotating process to keep that body going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2822)|
| 0:47:06| It will be advisory, no legislative authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2826)|
| 0:47:10| Any questions for the health department or the mayors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2830)|
| 0:47:13| Did I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2833)|
| 0:47:15| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2835)|
| 0:47:16| Second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2836)|

| 0:47:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2846)|
| 0:47:27| Dr. Buchanan, are you asking for volunteers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2847)|
| 0:47:30| We would take volunteers, certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2850)|
| 0:47:34| I'll do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2854)|
| 0:47:38| Next item, clerk, to be read into the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2858)|
| 0:47:40| The next item is on page eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2860)|
| 0:47:42| It's item number 28, ordinance O-12-11-102.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2862)|
| 0:47:48| This ordinance is to amend Knox County Code, Chapter 26, Article 6, entitled Stormwater Management,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2868)|
| 0:47:55| in order to comply with the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2875)|
| 0:48:00| and to become a Tennessee qualifying local program for construction site stormwater runoff control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2880)|
| 0:48:06| This amends Ordinance O-07-12-101, adopted January 28, 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2886)|
| 0:48:14| This is on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2894)|
| 0:48:16| This is from public engineering, public works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2896)|
| 0:48:19| Jim, are you going to speak on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2899)|
| 0:48:27| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2907)|
| 0:48:28| Parsi Gibson, Knox County Stormwater, 205 West Baxter Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2908)|
| 0:48:31| This is basically very simple changes to make us more compliant with the National Pollution Discharge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2911)|
| 0:48:36| Elimination System permit issued by TDEC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2916)|
| 0:48:38| Mostly it's changing some definitions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2918)|
| 0:48:41| and making ourselves align better with the construction general permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2921)|
| 0:48:46| as well as aligning with the requirements to become a qualifying local program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2926)|
| 0:48:55| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2935)|
| 0:48:56| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2936)|

| 0:49:00| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2940)|

| 0:49:03| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2943)|

| 0:49:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2946)|
| 0:49:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2947)|
| 0:49:09| Item 29 is Ordinance O-12-11-103.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2949)|
| 0:49:14| It is amending Article II, Section 2.03 of the Knox County Charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2954)|
| 0:49:18| entitled Membership and Election, District Seats Reapportionment and Redistricting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2958)|
| 0:49:23| to provide for a 15-member commission elected from 15 districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2963)|
| 0:49:27| This amends Knox County Charter as adopted November 8, 1988,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2967)|
| 0:49:31| as amended through referendum of November 6, 2012, Section 2.03,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2971)|
| 0:49:37| last amended by referendum of August 2, 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2977)|
| 0:49:41| This is on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2981)|
| 0:49:43| Moved to pass to full commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2983)|
| 0:49:46| No recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2986)|
| 0:49:48| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2988)|
| 0:49:49| Moved first and second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2989)|
| 0:49:50| Commissioners, this is a charter amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2990)|
| 0:49:52| We'll take eight votes to pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2992)|
| 0:49:53| Just wanted to let you know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2993)|
| 0:49:55| What does what happened last election day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2995)|
| 0:49:59| I see it's referendum of 11-6-12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=2999)|
| 0:50:02| What happened there, Bud?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3002)|
| 0:50:04| Can you elaborate on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3004)|
| 0:50:06| Isn't that when we align with the term limits change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3006)|
| 0:50:10| Some of the charter amendments through the charter review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3010)|
| 0:50:14| Yeah, that first one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3014)|
| 0:50:17| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3017)|
| 0:50:19| I'll just say I'm not in favor of this, but I'm fine on it going to without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3019)|
| 0:50:25| Mr. Law Director, when would this be voted on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3025)|
| 0:50:27| Let's say that it is approved or some variation of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3027)|
| 0:50:30| In 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3030)|
| 0:50:31| So we have two years to basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3031)|
| 0:50:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3034)|
| 0:50:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3035)|
| 0:50:38| Commissioner, will you restate your motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3038)|
| 0:50:41| Moved to pass to full commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3041)|
| 0:50:43| No recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3043)|
| 0:50:45| It's been first and properly second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3045)|
| 0:50:46| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3046)|
| 0:50:48| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3048)|

| 0:50:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3051)|
| 0:50:52| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3052)|
| 0:50:53| Item number 30, ordinance O-12-11-104 is amending article three of the Knox County zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3053)|
| 0:51:00| Appendix A of the Knox County code to prohibit billboards and other advertising structures in all zone districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3060)|
| 0:51:07| This amends ordinance O-90-9-130 adopted September 10, 1990 as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3067)|
| 0:51:14| This is on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3074)|
| 0:51:17| Anybody here from MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3077)|
| 0:51:21| Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3081)|
| 0:51:32| Mr. Chairman, could I speak to this also before Mr. Donaldson comes up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3092)|
| 0:51:38| and just relay a few of the things that we've talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3098)|
| 0:51:45| I've talked to Mr. Donaldson and, of course, the member of our law director's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3105)|
| 0:51:52| the most familiar with it is Daniel Sanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3112)|
| 0:51:56| And, of course, most of all, we've had several public meetings on the topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3116)|
| 0:52:02| And before I even get started with my observations about the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3122)|
| 0:52:07| I'd first like to thank all of the people who participated in the public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3127)|
| 0:52:14| We have definitely two sides that are fairly distant, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3134)|
| 0:52:23| from each other in terms of their positions on the issue of billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3143)|
| 0:52:28| What I've come to see and I'd certainly like for Mr. Donaldson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3148)|
| 0:52:34| and Mr. Sanders to weigh in on this in just a minute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3154)|
| 0:52:37| but there's probably no one more concerned with aesthetics than I've been, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3157)|
| 0:52:47| professionally and politically in terms of how I think this community should look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3167)|
| 0:52:54| But in the process of hearing these discussions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3174)|
| 0:52:59| it seems like there's so much information that we should probably be privy to in a setting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3179)|
| 0:53:11| that's other than a commission meeting because of the options that are available to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3191)|
| 0:53:17| Now, a ban is one option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3197)|
| 0:53:21| The bans that we're addressing in these three resolutions are one option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3201)|
| 0:53:31| Certainly, we have the option of regulating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3211)|
| 0:53:34| And then, of course, we have the option of doing nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3214)|
| 0:53:37| Now, which will cause considerable consternation probably within the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3217)|
| 0:53:47| But given those things, and I want other people to talk as well, it seems to me that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3227)|
| 0:53:56| and it depends, you know, what the board wants to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3236)|
| 0:54:00| it seems like we have not clearly defined to the Metropolitan Planning Commission what this commission desires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3240)|
| 0:54:11| And because of that, we've got some of these resolutions are a bit contradictory or we're not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3251)|
| 0:54:22| and I'm not sure, maybe people are in favor of these bans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3262)|
| 0:54:26| But it's my sense that we have some options, maybe in terms of regulation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3266)|
| 0:54:33| that would end up satisfying some of the needs of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3273)|
| 0:54:39| That is, particularly, we're not fond, those of us that are not fond of how many billboards we have right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3279)|
| 0:54:47| there's a possibility that we could work out something and reduce the number of billboards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3287)|
| 0:54:53| and also provide the billboard industry with some of the things that they wish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3293)|
| 0:55:02| Now, so I don't think we can do that in a meeting like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3302)|
| 0:55:08| And so what I'm going to do is I think it's wise for us to have a workshop on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3308)|
| 0:55:16| to define what we wish the MPC to do, to have some kind of in our discussion process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3316)|
| 0:55:24| define what we want to do, send that over to the Metropolitan Planning Commission again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3324)|
| 0:55:34| or through a workshop do this and then let that process proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3334)|
| 0:55:42| But I don't, you know, those are just my observations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3342)|
| 0:55:47| I want to throw those out at first and see what's the pleasure of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3347)|
| 0:55:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3355)|
| 0:56:00| Mr. Dawson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3360)|
| 0:56:01| We don't have a motion, so we can't discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3361)|
| 0:56:05| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3365)|
| 0:56:08| I'm going to move that we approve these, well, item 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3368)|
| 0:56:12| Item 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3372)|
| 0:56:13| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3373)|
| 0:56:14| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3374)|
| 0:56:16| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3376)|
| 0:56:17| Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3377)|
| 0:56:18| I have a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3378)|
| 0:56:19| I'd like to send it on without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3379)|
| 0:56:21| If it loses, it dies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3381)|
| 0:56:23| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3383)|
| 0:56:24| There's a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3384)|
| 0:56:26| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3386)|
| 0:56:28| Or I'm sorry, Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3388)|
| 0:56:31| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3391)|
| 0:56:34| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3394)|
| 0:56:35| You know, I would agree with Commissioner Norman on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3395)|
| 0:56:40| and the fact that there's so much information in the e-mails that we've been getting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3400)|
| 0:56:46| One person says we've got 90 billboards in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3406)|
| 0:56:49| One says we've got 800.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3409)|
| 0:56:51| One says we've got 900.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3411)|
| 0:56:53| Who knows how many there are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3413)|
| 0:56:55| Does anybody know for sure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3415)|
| 0:56:57| There's a lot of things that we don't know about this situation yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3417)|
| 0:57:00| To try to come up with a solution until you've got all the facts is not a good plan of action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3420)|
| 0:57:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3427)|
| 0:57:08| Commissioner Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3428)|
| 0:57:09| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3429)|
| 0:57:10| I thank you, Tony, Chairman, for your putting into words some of the issues I had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3430)|
| 0:57:17| I've been groping for a way to resolve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3437)|
| 0:57:22| I think it's impossible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3442)|
| 0:57:23| I mean, I know it's impossible to make all sides happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3443)|
| 0:57:26| But there's a group that would, you know, very good friends of mine that would like every billboard in Knox County cut down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3446)|
| 0:57:33| We know that's not legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3453)|
| 0:57:35| And another element that would like to have 1,000 out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3455)|
| 0:57:39| But I think I would support what Mr. Hammond just, the motion he just made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3459)|
| 0:57:46| Can that be incorporated in with what your suggestions are, Tony?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3466)|
| 0:57:50| Yeah, that's fine to send it on without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3470)|
| 0:57:54| I think combined with my idea is, and because of our law director's direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3474)|
| 0:58:02| that we need to take action fairly soon on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3482)|
| 0:58:05| I think we don't need to push it out too far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3485)|
| 0:58:09| But I'd like to see a workshop on it, possibly in the next early December,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3489)|
| 0:58:14| us sit down with the interested parties, of course, Mr. Donaldson and Mr. Sanders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3494)|
| 0:58:22| and hammer out exactly what it is that this commission wants to do, whether it is maybe they want to back up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3502)|
| 0:58:29| and try to ban and do the ban as is designed in the three resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3509)|
| 0:58:34| And that's the reason why I wanted to talk about it first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3514)|
| 0:58:36| I really just wanted to group it into three and or to figure out what is it that we want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3516)|
| 0:58:45| Do we want to try to work out a swap?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3525)|
| 0:58:47| Do we want to, you know, there's lots of, there's several variations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3527)|
| 0:58:52| It can be done that we haven't even addressed in these, in the discussion so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3532)|
| 0:58:58| And so that's the reason why I thought a workshop would be appropriate early in December,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3538)|
| 0:59:03| and that would be what I would recommend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3543)|
| 0:59:05| Thank you for putting that on the table so eloquently, and I certainly support that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3545)|
| 0:59:11| Sam, Amy said she was first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3551)|
| 0:59:15| If that's her story, I'm going to let her stick to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3555)|
| 0:59:19| I would, what I would prefer, and I think you, Tony, I agree with what you've said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3559)|
| 0:59:25| and what Mr. Schaus has said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3565)|
| 0:59:27| Mike, would you be willing to make this as part of your substitute motion to defer it to December| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3567)|
| 0:59:34| to give us time to do a workshop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3574)|
| 0:59:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3578)|
| 0:59:39| Is it okay for me to expand a little bit on what Mr. Norman had to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3579)|
| 0:59:44| No, I won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3584)|
| 0:59:46| The answer is yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3586)|
| 0:59:47| So go ahead and then I'll speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3587)|
| 0:59:48| I would support deferring it until December to give us an opportunity to do this workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3588)|
| 0:59:54| because I think that would be very valuable, and I would like to see that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3594)|
| 0:59:57| It wouldn't be a public forum, which is what we've had where people can come and speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3597)|
| 1:00:00| It would be an opportunity for us to sit down together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3600)|
| 1:00:03| and decide what it is that we're working towards here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3603)|
| 1:00:06| So if you're willing to do that, I would greatly appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3606)|
| 1:00:11| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3611)|
| 1:00:14| I guess, you know, I really don't think too many votes are going to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3614)|
| 1:00:20| I think folks and the 11 of us about how our minds made up where we're going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3620)|
| 1:00:25| I'm in favor of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3625)|
| 1:00:27| But if we're just doing this for image or to, you know, kick the can on down the road, we've done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3627)|
| 1:00:35| We've been kicking this can down the road almost since Dave and Richard and I took office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3635)|
| 1:00:41| I mean, we have deferred and delayed and postponed and put off more pressing issues on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3641)|
| 1:00:49| And I just think it's time to get some type of resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3649)|
| 1:00:54| I think the law department was, to me, sounded uncomfortable with the continuance of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3654)|
| 1:01:00| continuance after continuance, after delay, after, you know, pushback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3660)|
| 1:01:05| And it's we've thought a lot about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3665)|
| 1:01:09| And people are well aware of what the issues are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3669)|
| 1:01:13| So, you know, I'm ready to let's do something here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3673)|
| 1:01:18| Let's vote our conscience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3678)|
| 1:01:20| Let's listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3680)|
| 1:01:22| We've listened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3682)|
| 1:01:23| We've had public forums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3683)|
| 1:01:24| We've had workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3684)|
| 1:01:25| We've had MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3685)|
| 1:01:27| We've had, you know, the advertisers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3687)|
| 1:01:30| We know where the issues are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3690)|
| 1:01:35| So, you know, I don't think we'll work out every detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3695)|
| 1:01:38| That's not really our job to work out every detail, whether this wooden structure can be, you know, replaced by metal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3698)|
| 1:01:43| But I think we can talk about the big things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3703)|
| 1:01:45| And I think these amendments deal with the big things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3705)|
| 1:01:48| So for us to continually delay this, you know, it's not doing anyone service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3708)|
| 1:01:59| If we know what we're going to do, if we know what we're going to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3719)|
| 1:02:02| Now, if you're really, really, truly on the fence and you're going to let someone from an advertising agency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3722)|
| 1:02:09| or someone from the scenic knocks or whatever agency push you one side, I'm fine with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3729)|
| 1:02:15| But I don't think that's where we stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3735)|
| 1:02:17| I think we know where we are on this issue, these three ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3737)|
| 1:02:24| And I just think we need to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3744)|
| 1:02:26| I'll support, I will support, and I don't know what's on the table at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3746)|
| 1:02:33| I will support no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3753)|
| 1:02:35| But, you know, for us to delay this again, we're probably pushing double digits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3755)|
| 1:02:41| We've probably delayed this thing more than upwards of ten times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3761)|
| 1:02:46| And that's just too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3766)|
| 1:02:48| That's not us doing our business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3768)|
| 1:02:50| And I think we need to make some tough decisions, and I think we need to move on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3770)|
| 1:02:54| stand by those tough decisions and move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3774)|
| 1:02:57| Thank you for those words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3777)|
| 1:02:58| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3778)|
| 1:03:00| Yes, where I'm at on this issue is I believe that there is a compromise that can be worked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3780)|
| 1:03:09| I just don't know what that compromise is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3789)|
| 1:03:11| And that's why I support Mr. Norman's suggestions that we sit down and we take a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3791)|
| 1:03:17| For example, the cap and replace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3797)|
| 1:03:20| I don't really understand the nuances of that, but I want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3800)|
| 1:03:23| That's what I'm working on now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3803)|
| 1:03:24| I know that Asheville, North Carolina has enacted it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3804)|
| 1:03:26| Fayetteville, North Carolina is looking at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3806)|
| 1:03:28| Savannah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3808)|
| 1:03:29| I mean, a number of communities across the country have looked at this, and I just want to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3809)|
| 1:03:35| And I want the opportunity to say, all right, how does this work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3815)|
| 1:03:38| What is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3818)|
| 1:03:39| And is it possible for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3819)|
| 1:03:40| The other thing that I want to delve into a little bit and workshop, maybe do it, Mr. Law Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3820)|
| 1:03:45| is the lawsuit that has been filed against the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3825)|
| 1:03:49| I know that we have said, let's look at the city of Knoxville and let's enact what they've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3829)|
| 1:03:53| Let's look at the lawsuit against the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3833)|
| 1:03:55| I'd like for you to maybe brief us at this workshop on the nature of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3835)|
| 1:04:00| I know that hadn't been heard, but I'm just wondering, what is the lawsuit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3840)|
| 1:04:03| Is there a way that we can avoid this type of litigation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3843)|
| 1:04:07| Because my sense is, is that if we box this industry, and it is an industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3847)|
| 1:04:12| It's a multimillion-dollar industry here in our community that employs a number of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3852)|
| 1:04:16| A lot of people's paychecks depend upon this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3856)|
| 1:04:18| If we don't box, my sense is, is that we're going to be with the city and we're going to be going before a judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3858)|
| 1:04:24| And who knows where that will happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3864)|
| 1:04:25| That's why I'm saying, is there an opportunity to do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3865)|
| 1:04:28| And if there is, I don't know what that is, but I would like for us to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3868)|
| 1:04:32| The other thing, too, and I guess this concerns me a little bit, is I know that we all got this email about this employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3872)|
| 1:04:38| that was said that they were poisoning trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3878)|
| 1:04:43| And so, when I pulled up the information on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3883)|
| 1:04:45| I found out that they did not press charges against this individual for whatever reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3885)|
| 1:04:51| So, I want to get away from the emotion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3891)|
| 1:04:55| I want to look at the facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3895)|
| 1:04:57| And I would just kind of look at, okay, where are we in terms of nuts and bolts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3897)|
| 1:05:01| Let's look at, is there opportunity for compromise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3901)|
| 1:05:04| Maybe there's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3904)|
| 1:05:05| But I believe that right now, I don't want us to end up in court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3905)|
| 1:05:09| And I don't want us to end up like the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3909)|
| 1:05:11| I believe that there's an opportunity for us to sit down as a commission by our chairman's leadership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3911)|
| 1:05:16| and saying, let's look at this and let's talk about it some more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3916)|
| 1:05:20| This is where I'm at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3920)|
| 1:05:21| I'm not trying to delay anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3921)|
| 1:05:22| I'm ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3922)|
| 1:05:23| If we have to vote today, I'll vote today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3923)|
| 1:05:25| But I feel like that it's prudent for us to take a look at some of these issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3925)|
| 1:05:28| and let's really see where we are and let's get down to the facts and then let's cast a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3928)|
| 1:05:32| I'll be ready to vote in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3932)|
| 1:05:35| But I will make my motion that we defer it to December so that we can have this workshop early December| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3935)|
| 1:05:43| because I feel like we'll be able to vote in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3943)|
| 1:05:45| I know I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3945)|
| 1:05:46| And so I'll change my substitute motion to say let's defer this until our December meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3946)|
| 1:05:52| And I'm like you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3952)|
| 1:05:53| I'm ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3953)|
| 1:05:54| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3954)|
| 1:05:55| If the second would approve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3955)|
| 1:05:57| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3957)|
| 1:05:58| If you'll check back on the minutes about three months ago when this subject came up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3958)|
| 1:06:02| that's exactly what I suggested, that since they had their, the city had their package in order,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3962)|
| 1:06:09| that we sit down and review it so we knew what was in it before we went forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3969)|
| 1:06:15| Now I have this question, Mr. Law Department, and listen carefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3975)|
| 1:06:19| Are these ordinances right here exactly mirroring what the city of Knoxville has done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3979)|
| 1:06:29| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3989)|
| 1:06:31| Because when I look at the first one here, it says to prohibit billboards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3991)|
| 1:06:34| and other advertising structures in all zone districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3994)|
| 1:06:38| To me, that says you can't have any anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=3998)|
| 1:06:42| That's what it says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4002)|
| 1:06:45| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4005)|
| 1:06:46| That's to make sure I'm right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4006)|
| 1:06:48| Yeah, you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4008)|
| 1:06:54| Commissioner Brown, these were the ordinances that were brought for the law department to draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4014)|
| 1:06:58| And we drafted them according to the wishes of several commissioners here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4018)|
| 1:07:03| and MPC's recommendations based upon the information that was given them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4023)|
| 1:07:08| Can we get in layman's terms what the city did?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4028)|
| 1:07:13| Is theirs broken up three ways like this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4033)|
| 1:07:17| They have different ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4037)|
| 1:07:19| Before our workshop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4039)|
| 1:07:20| Yeah, we can do that for your workshop, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4040)|
| 1:07:23| Before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4043)|
| 1:07:24| Before, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4044)|
| 1:07:28| It's no use getting it on site when you've got to sit there and read it and waste time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4048)|
| 1:07:31| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4051)|
| 1:07:32| They have several different ordinances depending upon location throughout the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4052)|
| 1:07:37| So it's not really like one uniform status quo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4057)|
| 1:07:42| But we'll get you what they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4062)|
| 1:07:45| I think if you took this one here we're looking at here, number 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4065)|
| 1:07:50| Can you speak into your mic a little bit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4070)|
| 1:07:52| Number 30, that's an automatic in-court appearance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4072)|
| 1:07:57| The way it's written right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4077)|
| 1:08:01| I'm done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4081)|
| 1:08:03| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4083)|
| 1:08:04| Yeah, I favor having discussion and compromise about this because if we were voting today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4084)|
| 1:08:10| it would be a no on all the ordinances because I think they go too far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4090)|
| 1:08:16| December I will be out of town for the voting meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4096)|
| 1:08:18| And so if we don't come to a compromise, me being absent will not matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4098)|
| 1:08:21| But if we come to a compromise that I could vote for, I'd like to vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4101)|
| 1:08:25| And I know that puts it off until January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4105)|
| 1:08:26| But, you know, if there's no compromise, it's a no vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4106)|
| 1:08:31| And if I'm not here, it doesn't matter anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4111)|
| 1:08:33| So, but if there's a compromise, I'd like to be able to vote for it if there's not consensus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4113)|
| 1:08:38| Keep that in mind and come December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4118)|
| 1:08:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4119)|
| 1:08:42| Commissioner Newell, do you want to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4122)|
| 1:08:44| I just wanted to say or ask the law director if we do have the workshop in, say, early December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4124)|
| 1:08:53| This is an ordinance that's pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4133)|
| 1:08:57| And so from a code standpoint, are we in jeopardy in terms of any changes about any billboard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4137)|
| 1:09:07| or any billboard issue or are we in jeopardy from a lawsuit standpoint given we are pending,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4147)|
| 1:09:17| we have legislation pending?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4157)|
| 1:09:21| If, in fact, after today or after this month, you have legislation pending,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4161)|
| 1:09:26| then that reduces the potential of a lawsuit and gives us the opportunity to defer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4166)|
| 1:09:31| and have a workshop and have a second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4171)|
| 1:09:34| If you have a major change to the ordinance in your workshop, you come up with a new ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4174)|
| 1:09:38| It will be a first reading in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4178)|
| 1:09:40| You'll still have a legislation pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4180)|
| 1:09:43| And that gives us some solid ground to stand on because at least you're taking some action rather than just deferring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4183)|
| 1:09:49| deferring, deferring without any action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4189)|
| 1:09:52| So if you have a resolution, if you just pass something pending, have your workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4192)|
| 1:09:58| come up with a new one, that would be something we could defend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4198)|
| 1:10:02| Just to say we're deferring is getting a little more we're about deferred out, I guess is what I'm trying to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4202)|
| 1:10:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4208)|
| 1:10:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4209)|
| 1:10:10| And the only other thing I did want to give Mr. Donaldson and Mr. Sanders some time to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4210)|
| 1:10:17| If there are issues that we've omitted or considerations that we should take up at this time before we vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4217)|
| 1:10:25| it looks like we're going to have a no recommendation with, you know, with a direction towards a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4225)|
| 1:10:33| Are there other things that we should consider?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4233)|
| 1:10:37| I thank you for the opportunity to address you at the workshop, and I don't have anything to add at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4237)|
| 1:10:42| Please, your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4242)|
| 1:10:44| Name, Daniel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4244)|
| 1:10:45| Daniel Sanders, the Knox County Law Director's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4245)|
| 1:10:47| And Mr. Donaldson, would you like to say anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4247)|
| 1:10:52| Mark Donaldson, an MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4252)|
| 1:10:53| I would concur with Daniel that a workshop would be a proper setting for this sort of discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4253)|
| 1:10:59| Commissioner Burles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4259)|
| 1:11:01| I just want to make absolutely certain that this means even though we're not extending the moratorium by the past November 30th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4261)|
| 1:11:09| that the result is still that Lamar cannot go out December 1st and throw up a bunch of digital billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4269)|
| 1:11:18| If you all come up and pass one of these ordinances, you'll have pending legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4278)|
| 1:11:27| And most permits will not be issued without all you have pending legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4287)|
| 1:11:34| And then if you amend that to where it's a major change and goes back to first reading again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4294)|
| 1:11:39| that would keep that in effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4299)|
| 1:11:42| So if we have pending legislation, it's not a deferral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4302)|
| 1:11:46| And usually that puts a moratorium on what is going on for any new buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4306)|
| 1:11:56| Any other discussion on the item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4316)|
| 1:12:01| And the date, I had checked the date out, December the 4th to Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4321)|
| 1:12:10| December 4th, just throwing that one out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4330)|
| 1:12:12| But that's not okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4332)|
| 1:12:14| Mr. Donaldson, that's bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4334)|
| 1:12:16| Bad for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4336)|
| 1:12:17| I am in Washington, D.C., that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4337)|
| 1:12:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4340)|
| 1:12:21| The first week, is that what about Thursday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4341)|
| 1:12:24| I'll be back the rest of the week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4344)|
| 1:12:26| You're back the rest of the week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4346)|
| 1:12:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4347)|
| 1:12:28| Thursday the 6th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4348)|
| 1:12:33| But check the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4353)|
| 1:12:34| We've got a couple of conflicting meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4354)|
| 1:12:38| One big one for everybody south of the river or anybody that travels south of the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4358)|
| 1:12:44| Were you thinking of a daytime meeting or a nighttime meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4364)|
| 1:12:46| I was thinking late afternoon, 530 meeting or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4366)|
| 1:12:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4371)|
| 1:12:52| That'll work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4372)|
| 1:12:55| That'll work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4375)|
| 1:12:56| Meeting at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4376)|
| 1:12:57| That won't work for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4377)|
| 1:12:59| But a 4 o'clock meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4379)|

| 1:13:44| Tony, what about that last week of November since we've moved everything up a week this month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4424)|
| 1:13:51| It's after Thanksgiving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4431)|

| 1:14:05| That's 27th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4445)|
| 1:14:06| 27th is a Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4446)|
| 1:14:08| What time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4448)|
| 1:14:10| We do it early or late afternoon, 4 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4450)|
| 1:14:15| 27th, is that better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4455)|
| 1:14:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4459)|
| 1:14:20| Who's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4460)|
| 1:14:21| City Council is that evening, but they start at 7, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4461)|
| 1:14:25| We'll be through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4465)|
| 1:14:26| We're in trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4466)|
| 1:14:29| We'll check on this room, Joe Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4469)|
| 1:14:32| 27th at 4 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4472)|
| 1:14:34| Does the 29th not work for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4474)|
| 1:14:36| The 29th is fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4476)|
| 1:14:39| Can you not make Ed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4479)|
| 1:14:40| I'm just saying it's Knox Heritage's annual meeting across the street over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4480)|
| 1:14:48| On the 27th, it's Knox Heritage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4488)|
| 1:14:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4491)|
| 1:14:52| 29th, Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4492)|
| 1:14:59| I have two other meetings that evening, but I'll do this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4499)|
| 1:15:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4503)|
| 1:15:04| About 4 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4504)|
| 1:15:07| That helps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4507)|
| 1:15:08| Mr. Sanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4508)|
| 1:15:10| What day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4510)|
| 1:15:11| 29th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4511)|
| 1:15:13| Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4513)|
| 1:15:14| That's November the 29th, Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4514)|
| 1:15:17| Why don't we say, is 4 better than 5?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4517)|
| 1:15:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4522)|
| 1:15:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4523)|
| 1:15:27| 29th, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4527)|
| 1:15:31| Joe Lee is checking on the availability of the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4531)|
| 1:15:51| Mr. Lowery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4551)|
| 1:15:52| Bucket down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4552)|
| 1:15:53| There's a low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4553)|
| 1:15:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4555)|
| 1:15:56| We're set for the 29th at 4 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4556)|
| 1:15:59| Mr. Director, while there is a low,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4559)|
| 1:16:01| are you saying that it would be prudent for us to pass one of these on first reading today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4561)|
| 1:16:07| so we'd have something in the hopper?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4567)|
| 1:16:09| That would be a good idea to have something pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4569)|
| 1:16:13| So you can send something on, you know, without recommendation to the next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4573)|
| 1:16:18| Without subject to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4578)|
| 1:16:19| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4579)|
| 1:16:20| The only thing it would do if we changed it substantially to go back to first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4580)|
| 1:16:23| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4583)|
| 1:16:24| So we can pick one of these and say it's pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4584)|
| 1:16:28| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4588)|
| 1:16:31| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4591)|
| 1:16:33| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4593)|
| 1:16:34| If this is before us properly as it's written today, I'll vote no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4594)|
| 1:16:40| Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4600)|
| 1:16:42| I'm just wondering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4602)|
| 1:16:43| We keep talking about we're going to be sued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4603)|
| 1:16:45| Who's going to sue us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4605)|
| 1:16:48| I mean, if we don't do anything this month or next month, I mean, who's going to go to court to sue us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4608)|
| 1:16:52| It wasn't going to be a lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4612)|
| 1:16:54| The question was what would be the most prudent thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4614)|
| 1:16:58| In other words, the question was can they go get permits December 1st?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4618)|
| 1:17:03| There'd be no moratorium on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4623)|
| 1:17:05| They could go get permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4625)|
| 1:17:06| If you have something pending, that would be the same effect as a moratorium without extending a moratorium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4626)|
| 1:17:13| because you really have a piece of legislation pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4633)|
| 1:17:16| It's just a technicality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4636)|
| 1:17:18| You can put a moratorium if you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4638)|
| 1:17:23| If they sue us, then we're not as good a ground as if we have legislation pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4643)|
| 1:17:27| I mean, who is they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4647)|
| 1:17:29| Who would sue us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4649)|
| 1:17:30| Anyone who could be damaged by not being able to get a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4650)|
| 1:17:34| I mean, I don't think the billboard industry is going to be suing us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4654)|
| 1:17:37| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4657)|
| 1:17:38| I mean, so, I mean, I don't want to vote for something just to say, okay, let's vote for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4658)|
| 1:17:43| because I would rather have a good, you know, something that's before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4663)|
| 1:17:47| So I would not be in favor of voting on something on first reading with the notion that, hey, well, we can come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4667)|
| 1:17:51| and change it next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4671)|
| 1:17:52| But I would rather just defer it because, I mean, I would be very surprised if.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4672)|
| 1:17:57| That's entirely the pleasure of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4677)|
| 1:18:01| If you vote on one now and it dies, it's gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4681)|
| 1:18:03| And so you won't have any pending legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4683)|
| 1:18:06| So, I mean, you take that chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4686)|
| 1:18:07| If you put it up as it is now, you take that chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4687)|
| 1:18:09| And so if it dies today, it doesn't come before its own commission next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4689)|
| 1:18:14| But if it's voted down, November 30th, the moratorium dies, permit season is open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4694)|
| 1:18:31| Can we not just add then or amend Commissioner Hammond's that in so doing we extend the moratorium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4711)|
| 1:18:39| 30 more days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4719)|
| 1:18:42| Would you be willing to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4722)|
| 1:18:45| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4725)|
| 1:18:46| I mean, like I say, I'm ready to vote in December, but I do want this workshop because I do have some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4726)|
| 1:18:50| I believe that there is room for a possible compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4730)|
| 1:18:52| If not, I'm going to be voting no against these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4732)|
| 1:18:54| It seems like the simplest thing to solve everybody's problem is just that we add to your motion that we extend the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4734)|
| 1:19:00| moratorium 30 more days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4740)|
| 1:19:02| I'm very happy to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4742)|
| 1:19:04| So the motion would be that we defer until the December meeting, pending a workshop, and extending the moratorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4744)|
| 1:19:10| That would be the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4750)|
| 1:19:11| Does the second agree?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4751)|
| 1:19:14| Who's the second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4754)|
| 1:19:15| Second, Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4755)|

| 1:21:07| Next item, 33, is Ordinance O-12-10-101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4867)|
| 1:21:12| It's to amend the Knox County Code, Chapter 12, Article 2, entitled Peddlers and Solicitors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4872)|
| 1:21:17| to further regulate transient vendors and enable the Knox County Department of Codes Administration and Inspections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4877)|
| 1:21:24| to enforce said regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4884)|
| 1:21:26| This amends Ordinance O-97-5-101 adopted July 28, 1997,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4886)|
| 1:21:32| and Ordinance O-10-6-101 adopted July 26, 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4892)|

| 1:22:01| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4921)|

| 1:22:08| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4928)|
| 1:22:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4929)|
| 1:22:12| Anything else come before Commissioner Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4932)|
| 1:22:15| Yes, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4935)|
| 1:22:16| People are asking me if I'm trying to look like Mr. Donaldson or Commissioner Wright with my new facial hair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4936)|
| 1:22:22| The answer is no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4942)|
| 1:22:24| I am participating in No Shave November with some of my colleagues in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4944)|
| 1:22:29| And the money being raised is going to St. Jude's Hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4949)|
| 1:22:32| So, if anyone would like to donate on my behalf, I will be shaving December 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4952)|
| 1:22:37| But at the next meeting, it will be interesting to see how this progresses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4957)|
| 1:22:41| So, but anyway, that's what I'm doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4961)|
| 1:22:43| And I would appreciate any donations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4963)|
| 1:22:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4964)|
| 1:22:45| I thought you were mourning over the Lady of Isles loss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4965)|
| 1:22:47| Mourning that too, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4967)|
| 1:22:49| That's almost slitting your wrist type stuff, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4969)|
| 1:22:52| Commissioner Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4972)|
| 1:22:53| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4973)|
| 1:22:54| In light of what one of the ballot decisions made by the public, particularly the Knox County voters this past Tuesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4974)|
| 1:23:04| that being the closure of the so-called UOP, that's the Uniformed Officers Pension Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4984)|
| 1:23:11| the initiative to begin the initiative to make the change, whatever that may be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4991)|
| 1:23:18| falls to, of course, the Pension Board and to a subcommittee of the Pension Board called the Document Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=4998)|
| 1:23:25| And the Document Committee will meet this coming Thursday at 2 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5005)|
| 1:23:30| And that is comprised of, I believe, Steve Glynn is chaired by Nick McBride and also Dr. Briggs and Chairman Norman and myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5010)|
| 1:23:38| And I just wanted to make it hasn't got a lot of publicity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5018)|
| 1:23:41| I just wanted to put that out there for any and all members of the commission to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5021)|
| 1:23:46| It will begin the process of determining what the sustainable, we hope sustainable, pension plan is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5026)|
| 1:23:57| in all probability at some form of a defined contribution instead of a defined benefit as we've had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5037)|
| 1:24:03| So I just want to put that out there that that process will begin Tuesday, excuse me, Thursday at 2 o'clock up in the conference room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5043)|
| 1:24:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5050)|
| 1:24:11| Commissioner Shouse, I really appreciate what the Audit Committee does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5051)|
| 1:24:14| It's a very hardworking group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5054)|
| 1:24:15| So those of you commissioners that are on audit, my hat's off to you and the work that you all do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5055)|
| 1:24:21| Commissioner Wright, did you have something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5061)|
| 1:24:23| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5063)|
| 1:24:24| A couple of things that were before the Audit Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5064)|
| 1:24:28| One has to do with the audit that's currently taking place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5068)|
| 1:24:32| Readouts on that should occur in December, I think, now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5072)|
| 1:24:37| The next meeting of the Audit Committee is January the 15th, 2013, at 9.15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5077)|
| 1:24:46| Commissioner Shouse, was there anything else that you saw?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5086)|
| 1:24:49| I was going to mention, because we talked about, Chris brought us the financial report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5089)|
| 1:24:53| which he'll bring to commission at the lunch Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5093)|
| 1:24:59| There's an audit of the North County Pension Board going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5099)|
| 1:25:02| That data will be made available to the Audit Committee in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5102)|
| 1:25:05| And, of course, it's public, so any member of commission can have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5105)|
| 1:25:09| There's some kind of a computer glitch that currently prohibits KPMG from giving us an unqualified opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5109)|
| 1:25:17| I think that's just a fluke, an anomaly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5117)|
| 1:25:20| Chris may want to touch on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5120)|
| 1:25:22| It's going to cost us a little bit of extra money, I believe, because of KPMG spending some extra time on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5122)|
| 1:25:30| Do you want to elaborate on that, Chris?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5130)|
| 1:25:32| Yeah, it's Pew and Company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5132)|
| 1:25:35| Oh, I'm sorry, that's used to be KPMG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5135)|
| 1:25:38| They're bidding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5138)|
| 1:25:39| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5139)|
| 1:25:40| We don't anticipate a qualified opinion or a significant deficiency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5140)|
| 1:25:46| That is still up for the auditors to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5146)|
| 1:25:51| But we don't think that's going that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5151)|
| 1:25:53| It was a computer issue with an early adopter program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5153)|
| 1:25:59| We've had some issues about getting reports that show what they should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5159)|
| 1:26:05| And we're balanced on equal income statements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5165)|
| 1:26:08| It's a handful of journal entries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5168)|
| 1:26:09| We've pinpointed what the issue was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5169)|
| 1:26:11| And we brought the issue to their viewpoint from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5171)|
| 1:26:16| And so from that standpoint, we don't anticipate any type of opinion besides an unqualified opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5176)|
| 1:26:26| because there's nothing out there that we know of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5186)|
| 1:26:28| It's going to be okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5188)|
| 1:26:29| It's just it will has caused them to use more auditing hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5189)|
| 1:26:34| so we will see probably an additional bill from Pew and Company for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5194)|
| 1:26:41| And that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5201)|
| 1:26:42| We can deal with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5202)|
| 1:26:44| I don't think there will be anything, any exception to come from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5204)|
| 1:26:49| Richard brought to our attention that it is time for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5209)|
| 1:26:53| The code specifies that he get a, that our internal audit department get what's known as a peer review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5213)|
| 1:27:00| And this has been three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5220)|
| 1:27:02| So we will be looking at putting that out in our January meeting where he's evaluated by some of his peers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5222)|
| 1:27:09| It's just a good process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5229)|
| 1:27:12| It's also RFPs have come in for the basically privatization of the internal audit function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5232)|
| 1:27:22| We received three bids on that, or three RFPs on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5242)|
| 1:27:27| A bid is not the right word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5247)|
| 1:27:29| We will be looking at those and evaluating those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5249)|
| 1:27:32| And, of course, Richard's office, Mr. Wallace's office, is still the internal auditor and may remain the internal auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5252)|
| 1:27:39| This is an exercise that may save the county money and we may believe it's a more efficient way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5259)|
| 1:27:48| But as we speak, that would have to be approved by the audit committee and by full commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5268)|
| 1:27:53| So there's some firewalls there before that would happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5273)|
| 1:27:56| And lastly, if you recall, the September meeting, Pat Beasley, who many of us know, came and spoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5276)|
| 1:28:05| She has some concerns and some problems with basically a company she has not getting a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5285)|
| 1:28:12| receiving the contract to provide computer equipment to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5292)|
| 1:28:17| We had her stepson speak to the audit committee for about 30 minutes today, and it was the opinion of the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5297)|
| 1:28:27| There were just three of us were there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5307)|
| 1:28:29| It was not a full committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5309)|
| 1:28:30| There were three of the five, which was a quorum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5310)|
| 1:28:33| But it was the audit committee's opinion expressed mostly by Dr. Carsello,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5313)|
| 1:28:39| but also confirmed, I think, by Richard or by David and myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5319)|
| 1:28:44| that this was not a problem that could be resolved or a dispute that could be resolved by the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5324)|
| 1:28:52| We had legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5332)|
| 1:28:54| Of course, David was there, and Bud spoke to it in September, and Hugh Holt spoke to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5334)|
| 1:29:02| My colleagues spoke to it this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5342)|
| 1:29:06| And the bottom line at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5346)|
| 1:29:08| unless directed by the full commission to turn it over to Richard and let him have a full-blown audit of the situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5348)|
| 1:29:19| that it is not a situation that warrants the audit committee's getting into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5359)|
| 1:29:28| It's a Dr. Carsello said if we had assigned auditors to investigate every vendor that was not awarded a contract for Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5368)|
| 1:29:43| we would need to hire ten people to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5383)|
| 1:29:45| I mean, it would just be continuous and perpetuating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5385)|
| 1:29:48| So that one is a will not move forward from the audit function unless it's direction from a majority of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5388)|
| 1:29:56| And, Commissioner Ryan, anything I might have missed there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5396)|
| 1:30:01| No, I think the bottom line on the providing of electronic items, to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5401)|
| 1:30:10| revolves around the fact that the bottom line is it's the cheapest way for the county to get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5410)|
| 1:30:17| What's being provided, the way I understand it, what's being provided is the cheapest route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5417)|
| 1:30:25| So as long as that's what's occurring, then we need to be cheap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5425)|
| 1:30:32| There was another several sentences spent on the Costco opening in Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5432)|
| 1:30:42| And I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5442)|
| 1:30:47| Come and tell us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5447)|
| 1:30:48| Since we've thinned out the crowd, come and tell us about this $100,000 loss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5448)|
| 1:30:57| Chris did a great job of pointing that out to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5457)|
| 1:30:59| We were all euphoric about the Costco money, but he's got the real story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5459)|
| 1:31:04| This is a what if.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5464)|
| 1:31:05| Potential loss is the key word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5465)|
| 1:31:07| I don't think it's you won't know anything for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5467)|
| 1:31:11| Costco is in the town of Farragut, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5471)|
| 1:31:15| And so they're going to, you know, let's just not want to make any type of assumptions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5475)|
| 1:31:21| but let's assume for a second that $20 million of their sales comes from Sam's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5481)|
| 1:31:28| or some other place that's inside the city of Knoxville or Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5488)|
| 1:31:37| If that happens, you take $20 million and you take it by the local option sales tax amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5497)|
| 1:31:44| and that's $450,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5504)|
| 1:31:47| Then if you take that, so that's $450,000 of local option sales tax that would be moving from either Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5507)|
| 1:31:57| or the city of Knoxville and going to the town of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5517)|
| 1:32:01| The town of Farragut gives 50% to education, which is by state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5521)|
| 1:32:06| The city of Knoxville and Knox County gives 72.228%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5526)|
| 1:32:12| And so that would result in a $100,000 decrease of local option sales tax to the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5532)|
| 1:32:21| Now, that number I just used as an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5541)|
| 1:32:25| There's no way to determine what that amount is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5545)|
| 1:32:30| There could be a lot of new sales that's derived there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5550)|
| 1:32:37| but I'm sure there's going to be some of what would be probably called crossover sales that come from different stores| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5557)|
| 1:32:41| and go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5561)|
| 1:32:42| The crossover sales is where the schools would potentially see a decrease in local option sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5562)|
| 1:32:51| I don't think there's any doubt that Costco is a great addition to Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5571)|
| 1:32:56| and it's going to be a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5576)|
| 1:32:59| But what you may see is a decrease in local option sales tax to schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5579)|
| 1:33:05| I don't think there's any way to determine the amount of crossover sales that's coming from store X| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5585)|
| 1:33:14| and going to store Y.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5594)|
| 1:33:16| But we can watch it, and I'll work with Ron at schools, and we can keep an eye on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5596)|
| 1:33:21| But I do think, just keep in mind, while we will see an increase possibly in sales tax across the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5601)|
| 1:33:28| the crossover sales is what would hinder schools more than anyone else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5608)|
| 1:33:34| because the town of Fairgate will keep 50 percent of those sales and give 50 percent to schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5614)|
| 1:33:39| whereas Knox County or the city of Knoxville would give 72 percent to schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5619)|
| 1:33:47| Okay, questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5627)|
| 1:33:49| Any questions for Chris?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5629)|
| 1:33:51| Chris, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5631)|
| 1:33:53| Okay, anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5633)|
| 1:33:54| Commissioner Hammond, did you have something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5634)|
| 1:33:55| No, I was just going to say I do want to emphasize what Mr. Caldwell said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5635)|
| 1:33:58| It's good that Costco is in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5638)|
| 1:34:01| And so the fact that they, I believe, are going to be bringing people in from Loudoun County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5641)|
| 1:34:06| and Sevier County and Blount County, those who went to the Costco grand opening, it was packed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5646)|
| 1:34:12| They did over 500 memberships that night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5652)|
| 1:34:14| They're expecting to do 6,000 memberships the first weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5654)|
| 1:34:18| So any notion of any negativity toward Costco, I'd just like to say I'm glad they're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5658)|
| 1:34:24| And any dollar that's spent in Costco is a great dollar that's spent in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5664)|
| 1:34:29| And so we can be concerned, you know, about any divvying up later on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5669)|
| 1:34:33| But, you know, we'll, again, we'll wait and see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5673)|
| 1:34:36| But the opening was just a tremendous, a phenomenal success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5676)|
| 1:34:41| All the picture in the paper, your smile, big smile there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5681)|
| 1:34:44| You were happy they were there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5684)|
| 1:34:45| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5685)|
| 1:34:46| Appreciate your support there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5686)|
| 1:34:48| Anything else come before the commission at this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5688)|
| 1:34:51| Commissioners, I just want to thank you for letting the opportunity to serve as your acting chairman today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5691)|
| 1:34:56| And if you'll remember Tony this week with his medal, her name is Ms. Wolfenbarger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5696)|
| 1:35:01| If you'll be looking and watching for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5701)|
| 1:35:03| So our thoughts and prayers, Mr. Chairman Norman, are with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5703)|
| 1:35:08| Do I hear a motion to adjourn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5708)|
| 1:35:10| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5710)|
| 1:35:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5711)|
| 1:35:12| Adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121113?start=5712)|
