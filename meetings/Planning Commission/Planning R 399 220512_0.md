| 0:15:19| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=919)|
| 0:15:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=921)|
| 0:15:22| We have a motion by Commissioner Roth, seconded by Commissioner Uten, to approve items on consent as read with the exception of item number 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=922)|

| 0:15:37| First item on the day's agenda is agenda item number five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=937)|
| 0:15:41| This is a street closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=941)|
| 0:15:42| City of Knox for closure or right-of-way, public right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=942)|
| 0:15:45| File 5A22SC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=945)|
| 0:15:48| Applicant is Darlene Allen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=948)|
| 0:15:50| Right-of-way to be closed is Superior Street location between Lay Avenue and the southern lot line of parcel ID 082KK018 and 082LB001.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=950)|
| 0:16:05| Applicant's reason for requesting closure to require additional land for the placement of a modular home on the subject property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=965)|
| 0:16:13| Staff's recommendation, deny the closure of the section of Superior Street between Lay Avenue and parcel 082KK018 and 082LB001| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=973)|
| 0:16:28| since it would deny the opportunity for enhanced connectivity in the future that could be achieved by extending Superior Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=988)|
| 0:16:37| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=997)|
| 0:16:40| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1000)|
| 0:16:45| Before we open up for commission, Chair has one comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1005)|
| 0:16:49| We're seeing a number of closures in the last few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1009)|
| 0:16:53| Personally, I think they need to be looked at a little more holistically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1013)|
| 0:16:57| Maybe we do these, have a total assessment across the city of paper alleys, right-of-ways that were never built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1017)|
| 0:17:07| and look at what could be actually sold and used for additional residential units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1027)|
| 0:17:14| or in some cases, reverted back to the adjoining property owners when they're not necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1034)|
| 0:17:20| So that would be my suggestion to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1040)|
| 0:17:24| That would be a recommendation to City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1044)|
| 0:17:28| Ms. Brooks, do you have any comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1048)|
| 0:17:33| I appreciate you bringing that up, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1053)|
| 0:17:36| We would be happy to work with the city, and I will say that that is a conversation that I've already had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1056)|
| 0:17:42| with Director Harold Cannon of Engineering to take a more comprehensive look at all these paper alleys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1062)|
| 0:17:49| And develop a long-term plan for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1069)|
| 0:17:51| So we would be happy to take that on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1071)|
| 0:17:55| So I guess the first order of business, do you want to consider this request on item number five?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1075)|
| 0:18:00| And if you do, you would have to vote it up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1080)|
| 0:18:03| And if you vote it up, then we'll move on to the next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1083)|
| 0:18:06| Down, we'll move on to the next issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1086)|
| 0:18:10| Commissioner Newton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1090)|
| 0:18:12| Yeah, as I read the staff report, staff is recommending that we deny the request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1092)|
| 0:18:17| and then conversely, City Engineering and KEB said that they have no objections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1097)|
| 0:18:23| So I know we discussed a little bit in the general review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1103)|
| 0:18:27| I'd like staff just to readdress their reason for denial so we'll know why we're saying no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1107)|
| 0:18:35| Ms. Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1115)|
| 0:18:40| Okay, I'll go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1120)|
| 0:18:42| I'll go ahead and Levin can chime in on things that I might miss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1122)|
| 0:18:46| So for one, there is no specific hardship or criteria that would limit the applicant's request to develop the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1126)|
| 0:19:01| They are able to build on that and meet the dimensional requirements of the zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1141)|
| 0:19:06| In addition, if you look at the map, on either side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1146)|
| 0:19:12| so this is the only section, there is a couple of sections, one section here to the north on Superior Street that is open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1152)|
| 0:19:21| It is a small section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1161)|
| 0:19:23| So typically when we get comments back from our colleagues and other departments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1163)|
| 0:19:29| there has been no specific criteria that they look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1169)|
| 0:19:32| They might want to keep easements open, but otherwise they'll just say no comment or we have no objections to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1172)|
| 0:19:38| I will say from a long-term perspective, this could be a future connection, maybe it won't be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1178)|
| 0:19:46| but as Commissioner Phillips said earlier, the dimensions of this particular section of Superior Street could create a new lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1186)|
| 0:19:56| And so that's another thing to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1196)|
| 0:19:58| And that wasn't included in the staff report, but it is something that we looked at after the staff report was drafted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1198)|
| 0:20:03| and I was looking at the exact measurements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1203)|
| 0:20:04| And again, given our housing situation, this is a great opportunity for infill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1204)|
| 0:20:09| So we didn't see any specific criteria that was meant to close it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1209)|
| 0:20:13| Not that this is going to make a difference to me, but does the same person own each side of the alley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1213)|
| 0:20:22| I don't believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1222)|
| 0:20:24| Mr. Cranston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1224)|
| 0:20:26| No, the applicant owns the property on the west side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1226)|
| 0:20:31| Perfect. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1231)|
| 0:20:33| Chair recognizes Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1233)|
| 0:20:37| I appreciate what you said about how we're seeing more of these requests and that really a holistic review is probably the best approach there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1237)|
| 0:20:46| For that reason, I would support staff's recommendation to deny the closure of this section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1246)|
| 0:20:54| I'm trying to make a motion to do that. Apologies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1254)|
| 0:20:58| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1258)|
| 0:21:00| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1260)|
| 0:21:01| Before we vote, Chair will recognize Commissioner Schelso.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1261)|
| 0:21:05| I was going to make the same motion to deny this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1265)|
| 0:21:08| I think every piece of right-of-way, whether we acquired it through acquisition or when it was platted as an asset to the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1268)|
| 0:21:16| that we need to make sure we utilize and not just give away to a neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1276)|
| 0:21:20| I support denying it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1280)|
| 0:21:22| Thank you. Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1282)|
| 0:21:24| I'm right in line with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1284)|
| 0:21:27| We did one of these that was on Cherokee Boulevard, a property that's very expensive and we just give it to the adjoining property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1287)|
| 0:21:35| It really only, in most cases, benefits those people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1295)|
| 0:21:38| I'd like to see a way to generate some revenue and put it back into the neighborhood for a park or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1298)|
| 0:21:44| If that right-of-way was closed and the neighbors wanted to buy it, we could use that money to build play sets or something over there where they could in some way benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1304)|
| 0:21:55| That's all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1315)|
| 0:21:57| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1317)|
| 0:21:59| We have a motion on the floor by Commissioner Adams, seconded by Commissioner Roth, to deny the closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1319)|
| 0:22:06| First ask recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1326)|
| 0:22:08| All in favor of the motion, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1328)|
| 0:22:10| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1330)|
| 0:22:11| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1331)|
| 0:22:12| Motion carries unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1332)|
| 0:22:14| Item number eight has been postponed for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1334)|

| 0:22:22| Next is agenda item number nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1342)|
| 0:22:24| This is a sector plan amendment and rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1344)|
| 0:22:28| File 5E22RZ and 5C22SP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1348)|
| 0:22:34| The applicant is Homestead Land Holdings, LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1354)|
| 0:22:39| Location, southeast side of Hardin Valley Road, due southwest of Elm Grove Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1359)|
| 0:22:49| Tract is 58.6 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1369)|
| 0:22:53| Present plan designation is rural residential and hillside protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1373)|
| 0:22:58| And the zoning is agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1378)|
| 0:23:01| Proposed plan designation is low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1381)|
| 0:23:04| Proposed plan designation is low-density residential, hillside protection, and the zoning is planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1384)|
| 0:23:12| Existing land use is agriculture, forestry, and vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1392)|
| 0:23:16| Density proposed up to three dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1396)|
| 0:23:20| Staff recommendation, deny the sector plan amendment to LDR low-density residential because of topographical constraints on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1400)|
| 0:23:30| Staff is also recommending approved PR, planned residential development, zoning up to two dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1410)|
| 0:23:38| because it is consistent with surrounding development and the steep topographical challenges in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1418)|
| 0:23:44| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1424)|
| 0:23:46| Mr. Chair, let me make a quick statement on the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1426)|
| 0:23:50| Commissioner Scott Smith has advised that he'll be recusing on this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1430)|
| 0:23:54| He will not be participating in a deliberation or vote and has, for the record, left the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1434)|
| 0:23:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1439)|
| 0:24:01| Name and address, please, for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1441)|
| 0:24:03| Thomas Krajewski, 122 Perimeter Park Drive. Applicant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1443)|
| 0:24:07| All right. There are some people signed up to speak in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1447)|
| 0:24:11| Would you like to go first or would you like the opposition to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1451)|
| 0:24:14| They can go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1454)|
| 0:24:16| All right. Thank you, Mr. Krajewski.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1456)|
| 0:24:18| No, I'm glad you did. I had it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1458)|
| 0:24:22| Brad Earhart?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1462)|
| 0:24:27| Or Carolina Earhart?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1467)|
| 0:24:31| Commissioner, this is Daniel Wilkins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1471)|
| 0:24:34| We are speaking on similar issues and had spoken and had thought that I would speak first and then Brad and Carolina would speak after me, if that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1474)|
| 0:24:44| Okay. You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1484)|
| 0:24:47| And did you give us your name and address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1487)|
| 0:24:49| Your address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1489)|
| 0:24:51| Yes. My name is Daniel Wilkins, 1928 Hickory Glen Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37932.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1491)|
| 0:24:56| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1496)|
| 0:24:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1498)|
| 0:25:00| Good afternoon. I am here in opposition to this application for rezoning and amendment of the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1500)|
| 0:25:06| I'd like to ask if anyone else is here in opposition to this, if you'd please stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1506)|
| 0:25:16| Yes. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1516)|
| 0:25:18| Commissioner, in light of the number of concerned residents, we'd like to request a little bit of additional time on our oral comments, if that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1518)|
| 0:25:30| Any objections from the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1530)|
| 0:25:33| We gave them an extra five minutes, do you think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1533)|
| 0:25:36| We'll see how it goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1536)|
| 0:25:38| So we'll give you ten minutes total and then the developer applicant will also have an additional ten minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1538)|
| 0:25:45| A total of ten minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1545)|
| 0:25:47| We could go further, we could, but let's try to keep it in that ten minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1547)|
| 0:25:50| We have a lengthy agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1550)|
| 0:25:52| Thank you very much. You all can sit down. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1552)|
| 0:25:55| So I'm a Hardin Valley resident. I'm a neighbor of the property under review and I'm a native of West Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1555)|
| 0:26:03| And I don't presume to think that I'm going to give you any new data that's going to be any more persuasive than information that you already have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1563)|
| 0:26:11| because you already have before you the information that you need to make the right decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1571)|
| 0:26:16| And in this case, I do think that there is a right and a wrong decision here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1576)|
| 0:26:21| I'm sure you've conscientiously read the staff recommendation and the numerous public comments, as represented by the people here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1581)|
| 0:26:30| with the concern about the higher density development on this particular piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1590)|
| 0:26:35| The concerns range from the detrimental impact to wildlife, to the environmental impact on streams and wetlands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1595)|
| 0:26:42| concern about safety of traffic directly across the street from the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1602)|
| 0:26:47| the extensive acreage with ridges and hillsides on this property that's in the hillside protection zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1607)|
| 0:26:54| There's numerous concerns that have been voiced and these are the same concerns that are specifically recognized and addressed in the Northwest Sector Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1614)|
| 0:27:05| The Northwest Sector Plan calls for a green infrastructure plan that directs planners to, quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1625)|
| 0:27:14| balance development and conservation and, quote, preserve open space and natural areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1634)|
| 0:27:19| The Hillside and Ridgetop Protection Plan calls for, quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1639)|
| 0:27:23| development policies to encourage low-density residential development on steeper slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1643)|
| 0:27:29| The intent is to reduce density, not increase it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1649)|
| 0:27:33| The land use designation of rural residential is clarified even in the residential plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1653)|
| 0:27:39| It's described as, quote, areas characterized as forested, tree-covered, especially on moderate and steep slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1659)|
| 0:27:48| And that is exactly what this property is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1668)|
| 0:27:51| The recommended zoning for rural residential is, quote, densities of one dwelling unit per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1671)|
| 0:27:57| So in the plan, you can see on the south side of Hardin Valley Road where the property is located,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1677)|
| 0:28:03| the development surrounding it and the zoning remained agricultural and rural residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1683)|
| 0:28:11| because it was consistent with the current development and it was consistent with what the topographical layout would allow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1691)|
| 0:28:18| Whereas the property on the north side of Hardin Valley Road across the street from this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1698)|
| 0:28:23| was designated for higher-density residential units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1703)|
| 0:28:28| And so when you have areas that are already designated for higher-density units that are not yet developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1708)|
| 0:28:36| then when you try to make a change to a lower-density unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1716)|
| 0:28:41| what you're doing is that you are throwing the entire plan out of balance for this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1721)|
| 0:28:47| And there's really no compelling reason to change the zoning on this particular unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1727)|
| 0:28:54| And there's a literal mountain of reasons to keep the zoning the way that it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1734)|
| 0:29:02| A developer's request for higher density simply does not constitute a compelling reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1742)|
| 0:29:09| when you have so much data on one side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1749)|
| 0:29:11| This is not good policy to undermine a plan for individual applicants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1751)|
| 0:29:16| when that plan has such a long history of work and study and effort that went into developing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1756)|
| 0:29:24| So I want you to hear our request correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1764)|
| 0:29:27| We're not coming here saying no development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1767)|
| 0:29:30| Okay, that's completely unreasonable and we know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1770)|
| 0:29:33| What we're asking of you instead is merely to enforce responsible development in Hardin Valley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1773)|
| 0:29:39| that's consistent with current zoning and consistent with the Northwest Sector Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1779)|
| 0:29:44| Now, the Sector Plan was established to guide planning and development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1784)|
| 0:29:48| and as the Planning Commission, we're asking that you allow that to guide your decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1788)|
| 0:29:55| rather than throwing it aside just upon individual request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1795)|
| 0:30:00| This should be a fairly simple decision for the Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1800)|
| 0:30:03| and that decision is allow the property owner to develop the property within its current zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1803)|
| 0:30:10| and consistent with the policies established in the Sector Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1810)|
| 0:30:14| Your own staff recommendation was to deny the amendment of the Sector Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1814)|
| 0:30:19| due to the clear topographical constraints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1819)|
| 0:30:21| and there's no compelling reason why the zoning should increase to a higher density than it currently is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1821)|
| 0:30:27| The property is a picture-perfect example of what rural residential zoning is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1827)|
| 0:30:33| And we ask that you keep the density at one dwelling unit per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1833)|

| 0:30:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1839)|
| 0:30:54| Your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1854)|
| 0:30:56| Again, keep in mind that the time is, you've got four minutes and 46 seconds left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1856)|
| 0:31:01| Sure. Brad Earhart, 1901 Chestnut Grove Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1861)|
| 0:31:06| Good afternoon. My name is Brad Earhart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1866)|
| 0:31:10| I'm a professor of law at the University of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1870)|
| 0:31:12| and a resident of the Chestnut Grove subdivision in Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1872)|
| 0:31:16| My wife, five children, and I, we really love Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1876)|
| 0:31:20| Historically, there's been a lot of green space here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1880)|
| 0:31:23| In our neighborhood, for example, there's about 80 houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1883)|
| 0:31:26| each of which are located on one to three acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1886)|
| 0:31:28| And from looking at the maps, both at the planning session and before that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1888)|
| 0:31:32| I understand that most of the properties on the south side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1892)|
| 0:31:35| around the property enjoy at least an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1895)|
| 0:31:40| And so I think green space is part of what makes Hardin Valley unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1900)|
| 0:31:44| When you drive into this area, it's not like driving through Bearden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1904)|
| 0:31:48| or a more developed part of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1908)|
| 0:31:50| It's like driving through a community that is a purposeful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1910)|
| 0:31:54| and planned blend of country and commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1914)|
| 0:31:58| The change that Homestead Land Holdings is asking you to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1918)|
| 0:32:02| would alter that unique aesthetic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1922)|
| 0:32:05| This proposed change concerns the heart of Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1925)|
| 0:32:09| Hardin Valley Road is an artery that introduces anyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1929)|
| 0:32:13| and everyone to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1933)|
| 0:32:15| A person driving into Hardin Valley from Pellissippi| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1935)|
| 0:32:18| is going to drive right down Hardin Valley Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1938)|
| 0:32:21| and see this property almost immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1941)|
| 0:32:23| Even if the zoning doesn't change today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1943)|
| 0:32:24| putting almost 60 houses near Hardin Valley Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1944)|
| 0:32:28| would be too much for a variety of structural reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1948)|
| 0:32:31| that you already have in your fingertips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1951)|
| 0:32:33| But if this property were rezoned to allow 120 or 180 houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1953)|
| 0:32:38| we'll be losing part of what makes Hardin Valley special.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1958)|
| 0:32:41| My eighth grade daughter, Carolina, also has a few concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1961)|
| 0:32:44| and I'll let her speak to those herself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1964)|
| 0:32:46| As a straight-A honors student at Hardin Valley Middle School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1966)|
| 0:32:49| and a highly awarded track and cross-country runner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1969)|
| 0:32:51| she's a pretty good source of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1971)|
| 0:32:54| Carolina?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1974)|
| 0:32:58| Hi, my name is Carolina Earhart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1978)|
| 0:33:01| I'm an eighth grader at Hardin Valley Middle School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1981)|
| 0:33:03| and I also live in the Chestnut Grove subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1983)|
| 0:33:05| I am very concerned about this application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1985)|
| 0:33:07| As a student, it worries me to think about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1987)|
| 0:33:10| any more traffic on Hardin Valley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1990)|
| 0:33:12| I have four younger brothers who all attend Hardin Valley with me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1992)|
| 0:33:14| and we have walked this road many times to get home from school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1994)|
| 0:33:17| We also all run cross-country and track for Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1997)|
| 0:33:19| Programs that together have won a lot of state championships| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=1999)|
| 0:33:22| and enjoyed national success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2002)|
| 0:33:24| And we run up and down Hardin Valley Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2004)|
| 0:33:26| almost every day for our practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2006)|
| 0:33:28| It is a genuine boost to our spirits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2008)|
| 0:33:30| to run by this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2010)|
| 0:33:32| To have a stretch of green and not to have it be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2012)|
| 0:33:34| subdivision after subdivision and house after house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2014)|
| 0:33:37| To look at it and we see wildlife,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2017)|
| 0:33:39| sometimes deer, sometimes turkey, occasionally a hawk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2019)|
| 0:33:42| It is a truly beautiful space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2022)|
| 0:33:44| But more importantly, there is danger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2024)|
| 0:33:46| in adding any more traffic to these roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2026)|
| 0:33:47| My dad said that the report for this application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2027)|
| 0:33:49| estimates that if Homestead is able to develop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2029)|
| 0:33:51| the properties they see fit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2031)|
| 0:33:53| there will be almost 2,000 extra cars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2033)|
| 0:33:55| on this road every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2035)|
| 0:33:57| Already I see cars come dangerously close| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2037)|
| 0:33:59| to hitting me or my teammates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2039)|
| 0:34:01| I worry even more about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2041)|
| 0:34:03| for my four younger brothers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2043)|
| 0:34:05| With these experiences in mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2045)|
| 0:34:07| I believe that any increase in traffic on Hardin Valley Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2047)|
| 0:34:09| poses a real danger to the thousands of students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2049)|
| 0:34:11| who attend schools here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2051)|
| 0:34:13| Schools that are right across the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2053)|
| 0:34:15| from the very property that we are talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2055)|
| 0:34:17| I appreciate that growth can be good and even needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2057)|
| 0:34:19| But in talking with my dad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2059)|
| 0:34:21| I also understand that there is difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2061)|
| 0:34:23| between responsible growth that respects the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2063)|
| 0:34:25| and people just building houses to make money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2065)|
| 0:34:27| Please, please, please,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2067)|
| 0:34:29| consider how you would feel if this were your children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2069)|
| 0:34:31| running up and down Hardin Valley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2071)|
| 0:34:33| Also consider how you would feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2073)|
| 0:34:35| if this rezoning were in your backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2075)|
| 0:34:37| This is a decision that will affect all students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2077)|
| 0:34:39| in Hardin Valley for a very long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2079)|
| 0:34:41| I respectfully ask that you deny the application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2081)|
| 0:34:43| for rezoning and help protect Hardin Valley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2083)|
| 0:34:45| from overdevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2085)|
| 0:34:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2087)|
| 0:34:49| Thank you, Caroline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2089)|
| 0:34:51| Your name and address please, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2091)|
| 0:34:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2097)|
| 0:34:59| My name is Manuela Tasic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2099)|
| 0:35:01| and it's P as in Peter, T as in Tom, A-C-E-K.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2101)|
| 0:35:04| I'm at 12320 Pittman Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2104)|
| 0:35:07| I'd like everyone that is here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2107)|
| 0:35:09| regarding this to stand up and stay standing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2109)|
| 0:35:14| Can you all stand up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2114)|
| 0:35:16| I want you to see these people's faces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2116)|
| 0:35:19| Where you sit, you don't see the nodding of the head| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2119)|
| 0:35:21| and the understanding that you will now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2121)|
| 0:35:24| First of all, we have overwhelming traffic already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2124)|
| 0:35:27| I have gone to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2127)|
| 0:35:30| Knoxville has a real,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2130)|
| 0:35:33| Knox County has a real problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2133)|
| 0:35:35| with Campbell Station and Yarnell Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2135)|
| 0:35:37| If you don't believe me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2137)|
| 0:35:39| go out in the main times of travel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2139)|
| 0:35:41| and watch the speed demons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2141)|
| 0:35:42| They're coming down from Hardin Valley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2142)|
| 0:35:44| down Campbell Station| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2144)|
| 0:35:46| flying through Yarnell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2146)|
| 0:35:48| Once, twice, three times a week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2148)|
| 0:35:51| there are always accidents at intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2151)|
| 0:35:54| The roads department have come by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2154)|
| 0:35:56| and they've put new signs in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2156)|
| 0:35:58| and they have repositioned it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2158)|
| 0:36:00| I have been in my home 21 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2160)|
| 0:36:02| I have lived all over the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2162)|
| 0:36:04| I have never seen the amount of rubber stamping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2164)|
| 0:36:06| that goes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2166)|
| 0:36:08| I also find it quite interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2168)|
| 0:36:10| The other time I was here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2170)|
| 0:36:12| there was a two acre plot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2172)|
| 0:36:14| that was going to cut off Pitman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2174)|
| 0:36:16| and Scott Smith was a part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2176)|
| 0:36:20| I find it quite interesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2180)|
| 0:36:22| that Scott Smith has recused himself yet again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2182)|
| 0:36:24| for another development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2184)|
| 0:36:26| I also notice that this company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2186)|
| 0:36:28| Holdings, has three things on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2188)|
| 0:36:30| First of all, Campbell Station to 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2190)|
| 0:36:33| It needs to have a stoplight there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2193)|
| 0:36:37| You start adding any more people up there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2197)|
| 0:36:39| it's going to get worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2199)|
| 0:36:40| We've had accidents there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2200)|
| 0:36:42| The people that have the wood fence right on the corner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2202)|
| 0:36:44| come by and see it sometime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2204)|
| 0:36:46| Try to cross over like I have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2206)|
| 0:36:48| The people at the wood fence right there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2208)|
| 0:36:50| Heather, they are constantly having to fix their fence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2210)|
| 0:36:52| because people are running into it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2212)|
| 0:36:54| and they will not let their own children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2214)|
| 0:36:56| play in their front yard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2216)|
| 0:36:58| because they're so fearful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2218)|
| 0:37:00| They have an extensive medical kit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2220)|
| 0:37:02| to handle all of these accidents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2222)|
| 0:37:05| because it's those residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2225)|
| 0:37:07| who are first on the scene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2227)|
| 0:37:08| Excuse me, Ms. Tasek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2228)|

| 0:37:12| Commissioners, do you want to give a couple of minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2232)|
| 0:37:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2234)|
| 0:37:16| So we're going to add two additional minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2236)|
| 0:37:18| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2238)|
| 0:37:20| I didn't see the timer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2240)|
| 0:37:22| Please watch the time up there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2242)|
| 0:37:24| because in two minutes...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2244)|
| 0:37:26| I don't see where I'm supposed to be looking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2246)|
| 0:37:28| Okay, it's really hard to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2248)|
| 0:37:30| Okay, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2250)|
| 0:37:32| I don't know if anybody else...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2252)|
| 0:37:34| I'll raise my hand when there's 30 seconds left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2254)|
| 0:37:36| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2256)|
| 0:37:38| Another problem we have is with utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2258)|
| 0:37:40| Electrical has become a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2260)|
| 0:37:43| In the 21 years I have lived where I have lived,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2263)|
| 0:37:45| I have seen a complete decrease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2265)|
| 0:37:47| in our power for main example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2267)|
| 0:37:51| of the brownouts that we're getting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2271)|
| 0:37:53| We here, that you see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2273)|
| 0:37:55| feel that we are the forgotten people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2275)|
| 0:37:58| It is real quick to hand over all this land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2278)|
| 0:38:01| to all these people to make dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2281)|
| 0:38:03| and they don't live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2283)|
| 0:38:05| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2285)|
| 0:38:06| I am concerned about so much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2286)|
| 0:38:08| that I don't even drive Hardin Valley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2288)|
| 0:38:10| and I want you to understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2290)|
| 0:38:12| and duplicate, multiply this group of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2292)|
| 0:38:14| by about 30| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2294)|
| 0:38:17| because those are the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2297)|
| 0:38:19| who have a job they can't leave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2299)|
| 0:38:21| children they have to pick up at school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2301)|
| 0:38:23| and people like my own husband| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2303)|
| 0:38:25| who's a Navy veteran| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2305)|
| 0:38:27| who doesn't feel like it's going to change anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2307)|
| 0:38:30| So I want you guys to really come by and see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2310)|
| 0:38:33| Go sit at Campbell Station in Yarnell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2313)|
| 0:38:34| Go sit at Campbell Station in Hardin Valley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2314)|
| 0:38:37| and go sit in front of the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2317)|
| 0:38:39| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2319)|
| 0:38:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2321)|
| 0:38:46| For the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2326)|
| 0:38:48| Commissioner Smith is not involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2328)|
| 0:38:50| in this project in any way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2330)|
| 0:38:52| He originally had the property, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2332)|
| 0:38:54| under option and that was left go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2334)|
| 0:38:56| but he's not involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2336)|
| 0:38:58| in the development of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2338)|
| 0:39:00| Is that correct, Mr. Applicant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2340)|
| 0:39:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2342)|
| 0:39:04| Mr. Applicant, you have 12 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2344)|
| 0:39:07| Thank you, Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2347)|
| 0:39:09| You know, Knoxville is a growing city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2349)|
| 0:39:12| and it's growing because a lot of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2352)|
| 0:39:14| find the value of what Knoxville is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2354)|
| 0:39:17| and all of the reports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2357)|
| 0:39:19| the Realtor Association reports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2359)|
| 0:39:22| and a lot of other data prove that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2362)|
| 0:39:24| And with growth comes change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2364)|
| 0:39:26| and with change comes discomfort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2366)|
| 0:39:28| and we are keenly aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2368)|
| 0:39:30| We understand that and we respect it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2370)|
| 0:39:31| This property is 58 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2371)|
| 0:39:34| on Hardin Valley Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2374)|
| 0:39:36| as has been mentioned many times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2376)|
| 0:39:38| Not only is it that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2378)|
| 0:39:40| but it is also directly across the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2380)|
| 0:39:42| from Knox County's school property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2382)|
| 0:39:44| The property is within walking distance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2384)|
| 0:39:47| of a Knox County school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2387)|
| 0:39:49| one of the best Knox County schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2389)|
| 0:39:51| that we've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2391)|
| 0:39:53| Walkable communities are unique| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2393)|
| 0:39:55| for this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2395)|
| 0:39:57| There is not that many communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2397)|
| 0:39:59| not that many neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2399)|
| 0:40:01| that give you the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2401)|
| 0:40:03| to walk to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2403)|
| 0:40:05| This property would allow for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2405)|
| 0:40:07| The utilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2407)|
| 0:40:09| there was mention of infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2409)|
| 0:40:11| but the utilities are available to this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2411)|
| 0:40:13| We have met with the utility companies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2413)|
| 0:40:15| and they have been confirmed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2415)|
| 0:40:17| that utilities are available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2417)|
| 0:40:19| So that checks that box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2419)|
| 0:40:21| We understand the property has natural constraints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2421)|
| 0:40:23| We understand the property has topography.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2423)|
| 0:40:25| We understand that there are physical limitations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2425)|
| 0:40:27| to what can be done with this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2427)|
| 0:40:29| If you look at the historical aerials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2429)|
| 0:40:31| back from 1985,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2431)|
| 0:40:33| you'll see how much of this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2433)|
| 0:40:35| was utilized for farming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2435)|
| 0:40:37| It was roughly 32 and a half acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2437)|
| 0:40:40| give or take,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2440)|
| 0:40:42| that was cleared open land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2442)|
| 0:40:44| It was not forested at the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2444)|
| 0:40:46| and it was used for farming purposes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2446)|
| 0:40:48| most of which was pasture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2448)|
| 0:40:50| Incidentally, this also coincides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2450)|
| 0:40:53| with the 38 roughly acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2453)|
| 0:40:55| that have less than a 25% slope on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2455)|
| 0:40:58| So hilltop protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2458)|
| 0:40:59| and slope analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2459)|
| 0:41:01| will break down the slopes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2461)|
| 0:41:03| into various categories,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2463)|
| 0:41:05| various intensities of slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2465)|
| 0:41:07| And 38 and a half acres of this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2467)|
| 0:41:10| are 25% less slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2470)|
| 0:41:13| Staff also commented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2473)|
| 0:41:15| that there's a tributary to Conner Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2475)|
| 0:41:18| There are several tributaries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2478)|
| 0:41:20| up and down Hardin Valley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2480)|
| 0:41:22| to Conner Creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2482)|
| 0:41:24| and we understand that that has to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2484)|
| 0:41:26| taken into consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2486)|
| 0:41:27| in the design process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2487)|
| 0:41:29| but not necessarily in the rezoning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2489)|
| 0:41:32| We believe that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2492)|
| 0:41:34| given the location of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2494)|
| 0:41:36| the proximity to the school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2496)|
| 0:41:38| and physical constraints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2498)|
| 0:41:40| that the best use of this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2500)|
| 0:41:42| is to cluster develop it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2502)|
| 0:41:44| for residential purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2504)|
| 0:41:46| That is why we are seeking PR zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2506)|
| 0:41:48| PR zoning has standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2508)|
| 0:41:50| that better allow for cluster development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2510)|
| 0:41:52| and it provides the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2512)|
| 0:41:55| for concept review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2515)|
| 0:41:57| which is another opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2517)|
| 0:41:59| to speak in front of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2519)|
| 0:42:01| for the actual design of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2521)|
| 0:42:03| The current zoning agricultural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2523)|
| 0:42:05| does not have that requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2525)|
| 0:42:07| We've asked for three units an acre density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2527)|
| 0:42:10| because we thought that it is consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2530)|
| 0:42:12| with surrounding land uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2532)|
| 0:42:14| The property directly to the east| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2534)|

| 0:42:20| with three units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2540)|
| 0:42:22| The property to the north,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2542)|
| 0:42:23| across the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2543)|
| 0:42:25| which has the same tributaries to Conner Creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2545)|
| 0:42:28| is at a density of four units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2548)|
| 0:42:31| There is commercial property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2551)|
| 0:42:33| directly across the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2553)|
| 0:42:35| catty corner from one of the corners of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2555)|
| 0:42:37| and there is commercial property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2557)|
| 0:42:39| a commercial core,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2559)|
| 0:42:41| within a half mile of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2561)|
| 0:42:43| We understand there's opposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2563)|
| 0:42:45| to development in general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2565)|
| 0:42:47| in Hardin Valley or in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2567)|
| 0:42:49| and we understand that there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2569)|
| 0:42:51| specific opposition to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2571)|
| 0:42:53| project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2573)|
| 0:42:55| When we first applied for rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2575)|
| 0:42:57| the first thing we did was reached out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2577)|
| 0:42:59| to Hardin Valley planning advocates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2579)|
| 0:43:01| to let them know that we have the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2581)|
| 0:43:03| under contract and that we intend to rezone it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2583)|
| 0:43:05| and that we're open for conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2585)|
| 0:43:07| We then opened dialogue shortly thereafter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2587)|
| 0:43:09| with Chestnut Grove community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2589)|
| 0:43:11| which the bulk of the opposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2591)|
| 0:43:13| seems to be from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2593)|
| 0:43:15| We had several phone conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2595)|
| 0:43:17| with Mr. Wilkins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2597)|
| 0:43:19| We even met with them at their community center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2599)|
| 0:43:21| to sit down and talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2601)|
| 0:43:23| what they look like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2603)|
| 0:43:25| and to hear their concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2605)|
| 0:43:27| We've tried to be proactive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2607)|
| 0:43:29| in engaging the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2609)|
| 0:43:31| and the community's growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2611)|
| 0:43:33| as opposed to just boxing our way in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2613)|
| 0:43:35| Their subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2615)|
| 0:43:37| Chestnut Grove,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2617)|
| 0:43:39| where most of the opposition is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2619)|
| 0:43:41| is a neighborhood that is actually accessed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2621)|
| 0:43:43| off of Yarnell Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2623)|
| 0:43:45| as opposed to Hardin Valley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2625)|
| 0:43:47| It is not part of Hardin Valley proper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2627)|
| 0:43:49| from its main access point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2629)|
| 0:43:51| In addition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2631)|
| 0:43:53| there is a large creek tributary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2633)|
| 0:43:55| running right through the middle of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2635)|
| 0:43:57| And their neighborhood encompasses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2637)|
| 0:43:59| the top of two ridges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2639)|
| 0:44:01| Not just one, but two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2641)|
| 0:44:03| There are lots and roadways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2643)|
| 0:44:05| that lead to the top of the ridges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2645)|
| 0:44:07| The subject property that we're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2647)|
| 0:44:09| does not have the top of the ridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2649)|
| 0:44:11| because that is part of Chestnut Grove community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2651)|
| 0:44:13| And so we understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2653)|
| 0:44:15| that there are topographical constraints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2655)|
| 0:44:17| to this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2657)|
| 0:44:19| but we also know that there are ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2659)|
| 0:44:21| in which we can mitigate those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2661)|
| 0:44:23| All of this said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2663)|
| 0:44:25| we understand staff's concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2665)|
| 0:44:27| and we share them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2667)|
| 0:44:29| And even with a PR zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2669)|
| 0:44:31| with a density of three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2671)|
| 0:44:33| we're not sure that we can achieve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2673)|
| 0:44:35| that max density by design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2675)|
| 0:44:37| given the physical constraints of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2677)|
| 0:44:39| As such, we're willing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2679)|
| 0:44:41| and the current owners of the property as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2681)|
| 0:44:44| are willing to accept the staff recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2684)|
| 0:44:46| of PR2 without a sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2686)|
| 0:44:49| so that this property can become| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2689)|
| 0:44:51| another Hardin Valley community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2691)|
| 0:44:53| with all the infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2693)|
| 0:44:55| and the schools and everything else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2695)|
| 0:44:57| that everybody else that's presently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2697)|
| 0:44:59| already in Hardin Valley enjoys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2699)|
| 0:45:01| In this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2701)|
| 0:45:03| hopefully offering a walkable community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2703)|
| 0:45:05| to Hardin Valley Academy itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2705)|
| 0:45:07| We appreciate your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2707)|
| 0:45:09| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2709)|
| 0:45:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2711)|
| 0:45:13| Commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2713)|
| 0:45:15| the Chair will recognize Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2715)|
| 0:45:17| Thank you, Chairman Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2717)|
| 0:45:19| Just a couple things I want to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2719)|
| 0:45:21| I've said this before in public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2721)|
| 0:45:26| I understand the public's issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2726)|
| 0:45:29| with development and some of the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2729)|
| 0:45:31| and some of the roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2731)|
| 0:45:33| Quite frankly, there's probably not a road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2733)|
| 0:45:35| in Knox County that's capable of supporting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2735)|
| 0:45:37| future development like we'd like it to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2737)|
| 0:45:41| But having said that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2741)|
| 0:45:44| people who own property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2744)|
| 0:45:46| have a right to develop the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2746)|
| 0:45:48| in a reasonable manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2748)|
| 0:45:49| And it's not our job up here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2749)|
| 0:45:51| to restrict them from doing it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2751)|
| 0:45:53| within the zones and the codes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2753)|
| 0:45:55| that we have in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2755)|
| 0:45:57| if that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2757)|
| 0:45:59| I heard a comment just a minute ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2759)|
| 0:46:01| that there's the appearance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2761)|
| 0:46:03| of rubber stamping on this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2763)|
| 0:46:05| I've been on this commission a long time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2765)|
| 0:46:07| and that's just not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2767)|
| 0:46:09| The staff works very diligently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2769)|
| 0:46:12| to get it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2772)|
| 0:46:14| Now, do we agree with them all the time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2774)|
| 0:46:16| We don't, but they work very hard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2776)|
| 0:46:17| to try to get these proposals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2777)|
| 0:46:20| in the right way when they come before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2780)|
| 0:46:23| And we as members of this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2783)|
| 0:46:25| take our job very seriously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2785)|
| 0:46:27| both to prevent bad development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2787)|
| 0:46:31| but also to allow development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2791)|
| 0:46:33| people that own their property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2793)|
| 0:46:35| to allow them development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2795)|
| 0:46:37| in a logical manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2797)|
| 0:46:39| And when we have traffic people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2799)|
| 0:46:41| that tell us on this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2801)|
| 0:46:44| that the roads can handle the development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2804)|
| 0:46:45| we have to believe them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2805)|
| 0:46:47| Electricity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2807)|
| 0:46:49| those kind of infrastructure things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2809)|
| 0:46:51| are things that we don't have in control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2811)|
| 0:46:53| on this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2813)|
| 0:46:55| But I just want the public to understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2815)|
| 0:46:58| that we don't take these decisions lightly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2818)|
| 0:47:00| nor do any of us come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2820)|
| 0:47:02| with a predisposed rubber stamp| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2822)|
| 0:47:04| for developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2824)|
| 0:47:06| For us, it's not about the developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2826)|
| 0:47:08| making money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2828)|
| 0:47:10| That's not anything that we consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2830)|
| 0:47:12| So, having said that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2832)|
| 0:47:15| I'd like to make a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2835)|
| 0:47:17| that we deny the sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2837)|
| 0:47:22| per staff recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2842)|
| 0:47:24| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2844)|
| 0:47:26| We have a motion by Commissioner Ross,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2846)|
| 0:47:28| seconded by Commissioner Uten,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2848)|
| 0:47:30| to deny the sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2850)|
| 0:47:32| to LDR, Low Density Residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2852)|
| 0:47:34| per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2854)|
| 0:47:36| Any other comments before commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2856)|
| 0:47:38| Commissioner Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2858)|
| 0:47:40| The comment was made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2860)|
| 0:47:42| that they were looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2862)|
| 0:47:43| at cluster development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2863)|
| 0:47:46| Is that attached development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2866)|
| 0:47:49| or just grouping?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2869)|
| 0:47:51| That is grouping the parcels closer together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2871)|
| 0:47:55| the single family parcels closer together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2875)|
| 0:47:58| so that more of this acreage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2878)|
| 0:48:00| would be undisturbed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2880)|

| 0:48:39| looking at that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=2919)|

| 0:51:54| I do have some concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=3114)|
| 0:51:56| just as I looked at the case file| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=3116)|
| 0:51:58| and even as I've talked to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=3118)|
| 0:52:01| our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=3121)|
| 0:52:03| The surrounding community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=3123)|
| 0:52:05| quite the following| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=3125)|
| 0:52:07| as the previous opposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=3127)|
| 0:52:10| for several reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=3130)|
| 0:52:12| There's a lot of family units there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=3132)|
| 0:52:14| that have a lot of working jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=3134)|
| 0:52:16| across the street on Hart Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=3136)|
| 0:52:18| There are several elderly people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=3138)|
| 0:52:20| who are not able to be here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=3140)|
| 0:52:22| in person today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=3142)|
| 0:52:24| So I spoke with them in person yesterday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=3144)|
| 0:52:26| just in passing on the way to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=3146)|
| 0:52:28| as they were pointing at the signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=3148)|
| 0:52:31| And so what I want to bring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=3151)|
| 0:52:33| to your attention today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=3153)|
| 0:52:35| is considering this rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=3155)|
| 0:52:37| I know that there are things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=3157)|
| 0:52:39| that I do not want to get ahead of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=3159)|
| 0:52:41| in a sense of this use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=3161)|
| 0:52:43| I know there are things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=3163)|
| 0:52:45| that will come down the pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=3165)|
| 0:52:47| But I would like for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=3167)|
| 0:52:49| to consider potentially rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=3169)|
| 0:52:51| this back to low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=3171)|
| 0:52:53| I know that goes against| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=3173)|
| 0:52:55| the recommendation of the planning staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=3175)|
| 0:52:57| I know the planning staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=3177)|
| 0:52:59| works really hard looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=3179)|
| 0:53:01| at several different aspects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=3181)|
| 0:53:03| of this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=3183)|
| 0:53:05| It's in very oddly shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=3185)|
| 0:53:07| In a sense of the topography of the land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=3187)|
| 0:53:10| it has a lot of gray to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=3190)|
| 0:53:13| As you can see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=3193)|
| 0:53:15| there's a creek that runs off right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=3195)|
| 0:53:17| And it kind of fits into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=3197)|
| 0:53:19| a weird spot on Hart Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=3199)|
| 0:53:21| where there is not access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=3201)|
| 0:53:23| to Blue Grass Road as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=3203)|
| 0:53:25| And so in a sense of considering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=3205)|
| 0:53:27| putting a development here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=3207)|
| 0:53:29| with high-density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=3209)|
| 0:53:31| which is recommended right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=3211)|
| 0:53:33| as the staff is four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=3213)|
| 0:53:35| and under consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=3215)|
| 0:53:37| to move up to five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=3217)|
| 0:53:39| that looks like putting anywhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=3219)|
| 0:53:41| from 12 to 15 units on that parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=3221)|
| 0:53:43| And I just don't see how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=3223)|
| 0:53:45| 12 to 15 units fit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=3225)|
| 0:53:47| in that specific piece of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=3227)|
| 0:53:50| I know that we could say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=3230)|
| 0:53:52| it looks consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=3232)|
| 0:53:54| with the surrounding communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=3234)|
| 0:53:56| or the surrounding developments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=3236)|
| 0:53:58| whether it's my neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=3238)|
| 0:54:00| or the neighborhoods across the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=3240)|
| 0:54:02| But this is a very unique piece of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=3242)|
| 0:54:03| And so I have some concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=3243)|
| 0:54:05| in the sense of compatibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=3245)|
| 0:54:07| regarding the infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=3247)|
| 0:54:09| I know that there are some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=3249)|
| 0:54:11| preliminary calculations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=3251)|
| 0:54:13| that are being considered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=3253)|
| 0:54:15| and that's not completely done just yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=3255)|
| 0:54:17| And so just thinking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=3257)|
| 0:54:19| the safety of the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=3259)|
| 0:54:21| thinking about just the uniqueness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=3261)|
| 0:54:23| of this parcel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=3263)|
| 0:54:25| there are just several concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=3265)|
| 0:54:27| that we have and would like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=3267)|
| 0:54:29| to have that reconsidered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=3269)|
| 0:54:31| limiting the rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=3271)|
| 0:54:33| of the units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=3273)|
| 0:54:35| even considering going down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=3275)|
| 0:54:37| to a low-density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=3277)|
| 0:54:39| because of the uniqueness of this land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=3279)|
| 0:54:41| and the uniqueness of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=3281)|
| 0:54:43| if you were to put something there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=3283)|
| 0:54:45| in the sense of how would you have an entrance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=3285)|
| 0:54:47| Would they increase the traffic flow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=3287)|
| 0:54:49| Those are our concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=3289)|
| 0:54:51| and would thank you for your time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=3291)|

| 0:55:22| I would make a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=3322)|

| 0:57:01| and we are just requesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=3421)|
| 0:57:03| that this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=3423)|

| 0:57:09| And I actually think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=3429)|
| 0:57:11| that the staff is who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=3431)|
| 0:57:13| recommended or asked us to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=3433)|

| 0:57:23| Even if my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=3443)|
| 0:57:25| understanding is even if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=3445)|
| 0:57:27| did not get the zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=3447)|
| 0:57:29| we could still build what we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=3449)|
| 0:57:31| already have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=3451)|
| 0:57:33| The total parcel would not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=3453)|
| 0:57:35| be consistent, and that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=3455)|
| 0:57:37| really what we're wanting to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=3457)|

| 1:23:46| additional step which would be concept review to take any concern into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5026)|
| 1:23:51| consideration regarding the stream protection so with that said I'm happy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5031)|
| 1:23:56| to answer any questions about this about this property. Thank You Mr. Krzyzewski.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5036)|
| 1:24:06| Chair recognizes Commissioner Uten. Yeah can the staff person who handled this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5046)|
| 1:24:12| one give us some insight into the density calculation that came up versus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5052)|
| 1:24:19| the proposed density. Sure so the I'm loud the hillside protection area was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5059)|
| 1:24:29| not a major consideration in this since it's a very minor part of the parcel the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5069)|
| 1:24:34| environmental constraints considered were more related to the floodplain and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5074)|
| 1:24:39| protection the and the just the rural character of the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5079)|
| 1:24:50| That's what I was that's what I believe so I want to hear it from staff so I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5090)|
| 1:24:56| prepared to make a motion rezoning the property plan residential per staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5096)|
| 1:25:00| recommendation. Second. Chair recognizes Commissioner Grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5100)|
| 1:25:05| Turn your light on. That's three per unit. Okay. Commissioner Smith. Yeah I was just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5105)|
| 1:25:17| trying to so I want to get this straight the reason that I couldn't hear what she| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5117)|
| 1:25:23| said stream protection did not play into the density it did. It did. I thought that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5123)|
| 1:25:30| we were like on the one just previous it had a stream through there and didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5130)|
| 1:25:35| play into the density and if there is a stream there I'm assuming you probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5135)|
| 1:25:42| have not done a stream determination yet right? We have not yet this slew if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5142)|
| 1:25:48| will or drainage area that cuts through the property it's existing it's been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5148)|
| 1:25:53| there for a long time. One of the previous owners at some point has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5153)|
| 1:25:58| actually dammed it up and put a water control structure in there and they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5158)|
| 1:26:04| used it as a duck pond is our understanding what we've been told so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5164)|
| 1:26:08| there have there have been some changes to this area already made by previous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5168)|
| 1:26:12| owners. Our intent is to take into consideration whatever it is whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5172)|
| 1:26:18| it's stream protection or whether it's any other design element in the design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5178)|
| 1:26:26| phase but we are aware of it we do plan to design around it. Yeah I was going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5186)|
| 1:26:32| suggest you know we just last month rezoned the parcel directly adjacent to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5192)|
| 1:26:39| it at staff's recommendation which was based on the calculation slope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5199)|
| 1:26:45| calculation this one's 4.78 also if there is a stream there. That's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5205)|
| 1:26:50| incorrect the staff recommendation was three for case number 4E22RZ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5210)|
| 1:26:55| that's adjacent the staff recommended three. Yeah was this the slope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5215)|
| 1:27:00| calculation that was what we ended up approving it at right? Correct. Okay well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5220)|
| 1:27:03| that's what I meant. It was not at 4.78 it was right at the slope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5223)|
| 1:27:14| calculation. Anyway if he if he goes and determines that there is a stream there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5234)|
| 1:27:20| TDEC determines that that's the case there are stream buffers nothing will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5240)|
| 1:27:24| touch that stream so you know for the sake of being consistent I would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5244)|
| 1:27:32| supportive of a higher density more like 4.7 to be consistent with what we did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5252)|
| 1:27:37| last month and then you know again it's up to if he doesn't get it or if the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5257)|
| 1:27:45| stream impacts it that density will not take precedent. Just wanted to let| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5265)|
| 1:27:52| everybody think about that I think being consistent and what we do is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5272)|
| 1:27:56| important and the slope calculation does generate that density of 4.7. The other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5276)|
| 1:28:03| thing I was thinking about Commissioner was if you combine these two pieces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5283)|
| 1:28:07| which apparently we are you're gonna get over that 150 lot range which you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5287)|
| 1:28:12| starting to get into multiple access points you're gonna have to have two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5292)|
| 1:28:15| accesses and if you've got a guardrail and stream and all that other sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5295)|
| 1:28:19| thing you're you're kind of limiting what you can do and that so if you only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5299)|
| 1:28:24| have a smaller piece to work with on a state highway like that limiting that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5304)|
| 1:28:31| density just a little bit that's still a lot of lots for that area right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5311)|
| 1:28:36| I'm not going to go, I can go either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5316)|
| 1:28:40| Chair recognizes Commissioner Schell so. So theoretically if someone obtains two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5320)|
| 1:28:47| parcels with different PR zones do they how do they bring forth a site plan or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5327)|
| 1:28:54| do they come back with a new request to PR average them both together what's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5334)|
| 1:28:59| have we seen that how do we handle that? Each site I assume will have that density up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5339)|
| 1:29:05| that density. All right, no other, Commissioner Locke. Thank you Chair, my question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5345)|
| 1:29:17| we're talking about limit the density and then allowing more density. I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5357)|
| 1:29:23| inclined to allow more density because if we do if they did end up combining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5363)|
| 1:29:27| they end up having to have two different access points that's kind of controlled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5367)|
| 1:29:31| kind of self-limiting isn't it? Because if they yeah if they can't get the number they have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5371)|
| 1:29:37| have two access points and the state doesn't allow them to then it limits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5377)|
| 1:29:42| its density automatically whether they're allowed four, four and a half, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5382)|
| 1:29:49| No, not necessarily. I'll defer. Mr. Snowden, do you want to weigh in on TDOTs and how they might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5389)|
| 1:30:04| potentially handle the situation? You and I'm sorry you talking about the separate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5404)|
| 1:30:12| parcel and how they how they require access? Well we're talking about you got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5412)|
| 1:30:16| this density on this property and this density on the other. If we allowed the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5416)|
| 1:30:21| higher density on this property we're talking about now and because of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5421)|
| 1:30:25| density it required two access points but we weren't they weren't allowed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5425)|
| 1:30:29| have two access points because of distance or site distance or whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5429)|
| 1:30:34| that self limits really self limits the density on the property whether we allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5434)|
| 1:30:40| four and a half, three, is that right? They're not in common ownership are they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5440)|
| 1:30:46| There's two separate property owners? Yes. They're all the same developer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5446)|
| 1:30:52| Okay yeah I mean I think in that situation TDOT would have a little more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5452)|
| 1:30:56| latitude. If it was separate owners obviously they would have to grant. They| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5456)|
| 1:31:00| can't restrict access even if it's maybe not if it's less than ideal but in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5460)|
| 1:31:05| case I think TDOT would be looking for an access point that would be most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5465)|
| 1:31:10| advantageous from safety. Chair recognizes Commissioner Adams. I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5470)|
| 1:31:19| wanted to point out that it's nice that we know that this property is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5479)|
| 1:31:24| contiguous to the other and that there's the intention for them to be coupled but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5484)|
| 1:31:28| that's not really what we're supposed to be considering when we're looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5488)|
| 1:31:31| this particular parcel and the rezoning of it. Chair recognizes Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5491)|
| 1:31:39| I noticed on the aerial is this a road or a driveway on the north side of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5499)|
| 1:31:46| That is a driveway. Okay so you're not talking about using that for? No not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5506)|
| 1:31:53| as a road no we would abandon that and you know with PR there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5513)|
| 1:31:58| I don't know if that would fall within the periphery buffer or not but it looks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5518)|
| 1:32:04| close and and likewise we would have to take into consideration any any flood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5524)|
| 1:32:09| plane that exists on the property and design around that as well. So there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5529)|
| 1:32:13| some site limiting factors here as there often are with these with these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5533)|
| 1:32:17| properties that will ultimately dictate how the site is designed and utilized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5537)|
| 1:32:23| Our request for zoning at the density that we requested allows us to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5543)|
| 1:32:30| design flexibility and what type of product ends up going here and and how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5550)|
| 1:32:35| this neighborhood fits the the constraints the geographic constraints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5555)|
| 1:32:40| so that was the intent of our request. Chair recognizes Commissioner Midas. Thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5560)|
| 1:32:47| you I was just in looking at this property I know I ride my bike down the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5567)|
| 1:32:51| street and it's a pretty rural area I I think staff's got it right I like the I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5571)|
| 1:32:58| think a lower density kind of conforms more with the rural character of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5578)|
| 1:33:03| area and I'm going to support staff's recommendation on this. Thank you. Chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5583)|
| 1:33:07| recognizes Commissioner Graf. I agree with Commissioner Midas and also by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5587)|
| 1:33:15| going from three per acre to five per acre we're increasing the density and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5595)|
| 1:33:23| the traffic and all the uses by 66 percent when it's not just oh it's just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5603)|
| 1:33:33| two more houses it's 66 percent more density on everything when you go from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5613)|
| 1:33:42| three to five and I think that the rural character of that neighborhood needs to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5622)|
| 1:33:49| be maintained. I didn't vote for it last month and I don't think I'd vote for it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5629)|
| 1:33:55| this month either. Thank you Mr. Graf. All right we have a motion on the floor by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5635)|

| 1:37:05| remaining time after the opposition speaks. Ben Mullins 550 West Main Street here for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5825)|
| 1:37:11| applicant. We appreciate the work staff's done on this one. We know there's been a lot of community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5831)|
| 1:37:18| input and concern about this and we are in agreement with staff's recommendation including| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5838)|
| 1:37:22| the denial of the one variance. We can work within the the k value that that's required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5842)|
| 1:37:28| by the subdivision regulations. There was a little bit of a mix up on the site plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5848)|
| 1:37:38| The intensity of what we're proposing remains the same. They're on the very small north| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5858)|
| 1:37:45| western corner of the property. There's going to be 15 single family residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5865)|
| 1:37:49| lots there and then the balance was going to be the 16th lot which is where the 16| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5869)|
| 1:37:56| units an acre or 16 units is in staff's recommendation. But what we actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5876)|
| 1:38:01| intended to do and didn't until after the application was filed, we wanted to basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5881)|
| 1:38:06| divide the balance of that property into two lots creating 17 lots. Those are you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5886)|
| 1:38:12| significantly large lots. There's a lot of topographic constraints as you get beyond the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5892)|
| 1:38:17| TVA easement there. There is one proposed house in a driveway on what is now lot 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5897)|
| 1:38:23| The lot new lot 16 that we would like to propose, there's no plans for it yet. Ultimately what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5903)|
| 1:38:31| the developer, Mr. Roberts, and he is here, him and his wife intend to build their house on one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5911)|
| 1:38:36| of those lots and they are looking at the other lot potentially for a house for their children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5916)|
| 1:38:41| So they are actually intending to actually be neighbors to this development here and to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5921)|
| 1:38:46| this neighborhood. I know Mr. Reynolds brought this up in the agenda review. I can hand out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5926)|
| 1:38:52| copies. I believe that this is in your packet already but I have paper copies as well. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5932)|
| 1:38:56| would ask that the concept used on review be revised, basically split this remainder of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5936)|
| 1:39:03| balance of the property into two lots instead of just one. But with that I'd like to reserve the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5943)|
| 1:39:09| remainder of my time to address any concerns the neighborhood has. Thank you. Thank you, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5949)|
| 1:39:13| Mullins. Ms. Malone. Hello. My name is Abigail Malone. I live at 905 Irwin Drive directly across| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5953)|
| 1:39:25| from the property. Since the plans were posted, I've had calls, emails, texts from my neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5965)|
| 1:39:31| So I'm here representing the neighborhood. There are still some concerns that we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5971)|
| 1:39:37| concerned about. To be honest with you, we are not 100% on board with this development as of now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5977)|
| 1:39:47| because we do have still some concerns about safety and flooding and the characteristics of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5987)|
| 1:39:55| the neighborhood. I don't know if you guys received my PDF. I inserted some pictures of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=5995)|
| 1:40:00| the drive along Irwin Road. And of course you can pull it up on Google Maps and see it anytime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6000)|
| 1:40:09| We are concerned about Irwin Road. Sitting here listening to everyone talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6009)|
| 1:40:14| there's so many developments happening and everyone's concerned about the safety of their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6014)|
| 1:40:18| roads. It's a very real concern for us as well. If you haven't driven Irwin, I invite you to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6018)|
| 1:40:25| That sharp curve is right in front of my house and it is very dangerous. I included a photo| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6025)|
| 1:40:30| not taken just in March of a vehicle that lost control on that curve, ran through my yard and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6030)|
| 1:40:38| hit my neighbor's tree. And so whenever the rezoning was first happening, my husband and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6038)|
| 1:40:45| I went out to our mailbox and we took a rangefinder and we looked at the sight distance that existed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6045)|
| 1:40:51| to where the driveway is now and it was not even 300 feet thin. So we are concerned and our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6051)|
| 1:40:57| neighbors were very concerned about the moving of the driveway and the entrance further into that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6057)|
| 1:41:04| blind curve because it not only curves once but twice. You think you're out of the curve and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6064)|
| 1:41:08| you're not. And so that is very, very concerning to us and also increasing the traffic on that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6068)|
| 1:41:16| You know, I saw, I don't know what these comments are from staff I suppose, but you know it said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6076)|
| 1:41:22| something about, you know, not bringing more traffic into the residential area or something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6082)|
| 1:41:27| like that. But this is our residential area. We do live on Irwin Road. I'm not quite sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6087)|
| 1:41:32| I have a three-year-old, if I'll ever let him play in the front yard to be honest with you after this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6092)|
| 1:41:38| So it is a real concern of safety and we all measured that road and it doesn't even meet 20| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6098)|
| 1:41:44| feet up that road. It doesn't. It's very narrow. Sorry, I have like a public speaking fear but I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6104)|
| 1:41:53| here. So anyway, you know, we're not, we're still uneasy about, you know, this moving forward without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6113)|
| 1:42:04| these being addressed. We are very concerned and so that is a major problem for us that we still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6124)|
| 1:42:11| see bringing this many people into this little area. Second is a huge one, the characteristic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6131)|
| 1:42:20| of our neighborhood. You know, as you drive down Irwin, it's wooded, it's lush, it's like set in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6140)|
| 1:42:28| this like serene little forest. I mean he's going to name it Parker's Forest. Is it going to feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6148)|
| 1:42:34| like a forest, you know? Is it going to have the feel of our neighborhood? This is quite a large| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6154)|
| 1:42:39| area that's being developed and honestly, you know, in the notes on online it says that this is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6159)|
| 1:42:46| you know, consistent with the surrounding neighborhood. As I look at this plan, it doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6166)|
| 1:42:51| feel consistent with our neighborhood. It does not. I am very concerned about losing all this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6171)|
| 1:42:59| natural vegetation, the mature trees that make it so beautiful to drive through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6179)|
| 1:43:04| And also, large mature trees, they help with flooding. A mature tree can take in 40 gallons of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6184)|
| 1:43:13| water a day. We just really would love to see lots of mature trees left. We would love to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6193)|
| 1:43:21| vegetation. We would love to see more buffer between this development and the road and what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6201)|
| 1:43:29| the rest of the neighborhood looks like. As you go through those photos, you can see there's like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6209)|
| 1:43:34| 200 plus year old tree in my backyard. It's gorgeous. We just don't want it to be stripped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6214)|
| 1:43:39| bare and have all these small rental properties just clustered up in the middle of our beautiful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6219)|
| 1:43:45| neighborhood. It will lose its magic. I've talked about flooding. You know, there is a major| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6225)|
| 1:43:55| concern with this property being a flood zone around where we live. We are so concerned that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6235)|
| 1:44:02| every effort and care will be taken into the planning of this building, making sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6242)|
| 1:44:08| the runoff, the drainage, everything is done according to how it's supposed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6248)|
| 1:44:16| so that we don't end up flooding our homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6256)|
| 1:44:21| And, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6261)|
| 1:44:27| I guess that's it. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6267)|
| 1:44:29| Thank you, Ms. Malone. And I would suggest that you get involved with Advance Knox,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6269)|
| 1:44:36| which is the county's long-range master plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6276)|
| 1:44:40| And that maybe help get everybody comfortable with protecting your neighborhood. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6280)|
| 1:44:47| And thank you, Ms. Malone. I appreciate your comments. And we've been hearing these comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6287)|
| 1:44:52| since the rezoning. We met with the neighbors before we came forward with rezoning. There was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6292)|
| 1:44:57| quite a bit of conversation at the rezoning phase when we were asking for 3.5 units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6297)|
| 1:45:03| and staff had recommended one. We ultimately met with the representatives of the neighborhood and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6303)|
| 1:45:07| agreed before county commission that we'll move forward with the one that we probably don't even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6307)|
| 1:45:12| need that. And it doesn't look like we're going to need that much density given the constraints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6312)|
| 1:45:17| here. You know, the density we're proposing for this entire parcel is about 0.3 dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6317)|
| 1:45:24| an acre. You look at the 17 acres because we have the two largest state lots. The bulk of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6324)|
| 1:45:32| subdivision that we're proposing is on about 3.5 acres, and there will have to be some clearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6332)|
| 1:45:38| of the vegetation along Irwin Road in order to get the site distance. The plans show a 300-foot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6338)|
| 1:45:44| site distance easement in order to make that. And there's a separate driveway entrance to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6344)|
| 1:45:50| northeast of the property to reach the two lots on the back. So there will be some clearing in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6350)|
| 1:45:57| that area, but the bulk of this and the hillside area and the forest behind it are going to remain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6357)|
| 1:46:03| undisturbed for the most part. I mean, we're looking at potentially two large estate lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6363)|
| 1:46:09| in addition to the 15 single-family detached homes. So density really isn't a concern. It's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6369)|
| 1:46:17| well within the one unit an acre that this commission and planning commission approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6377)|
| 1:46:21| unanimously. Traffic is a function of density. There's not going to be a significant traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6381)|
| 1:46:28| impact on this. Mr. Reynolds made some comments in the agenda review that, you know, that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6388)|
| 1:46:35| concerns about traffic factored into this body's decision to only rezone this at one unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6395)|
| 1:46:42| an acre and that, you know, with the new road alignment, the site distance easement, that Irwin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6402)|
| 1:46:48| Road will be able to handle the traffic volume that this development would yield. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6408)|
| 1:46:57| regarding their concerns on flooding, I mean, we have a very robust stormwater ordinance. We'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6417)|
| 1:47:02| have to follow that every step of the way. You know, Mr. Elliott, Mr. Snowden and their crew| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6422)|
| 1:47:08| will make sure that we do follow everything that we're supposed to do to make sure that we're in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6428)|
| 1:47:13| compliance and that those concerns will be addressed. There's 11 conditions to a recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6433)|
| 1:47:20| of approval here, and those conditions are put in place in mind to address the concerns that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6440)|
| 1:47:27| neighbors have raised here. And so we will do what we need to do to make sure that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6447)|
| 1:47:33| we are working within the rules and we are preserving the rural nature of this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6453)|
| 1:47:39| I mean, there is a PR development just a little far down the road on the west that's three and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6459)|
| 1:47:45| a half dwelling units an acre, which is, I think, what fed into our initial request before we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6465)|
| 1:47:51| reached an agreement with the neighborhood to stick to one unit an acre. So we appreciate all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6471)|
| 1:47:55| staff's work. We're willing to continue to work with them through the permitting process to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6475)|
| 1:47:59| sure that we do a good quality of development. This development, you mentioned they did complain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6479)|
| 1:48:07| a little bit that these are intended to be rental homes, and that is the plan right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6487)|
| 1:48:10| There's no prohibition to having single-family detached rental homes. Mr. Roberts has similar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6490)|
| 1:48:17| developments, Laurel Meadows and on Beaver Creek that follow us. It's a very good option to kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6497)|
| 1:48:23| of meet that affordable housing need that the county is looking at right now. So we'd ask that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6503)|
| 1:48:28| you follow staff's recommendation and approve with the one caveat of allowing us to divide up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6508)|
| 1:48:33| the remainder of the southern portion of the property into two large lots. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6513)|
| 1:48:39| Thank you, Mr. Mullins. Chair recognizes Commissioner Ute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6519)|
| 1:48:45| Just a question for staff about the late addition of the subdivision of the lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6525)|
| 1:48:50| Is that something that we can deal with or was that done too late or what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6530)|
| 1:48:58| It's working. Is it working? It sounds really soft over here on this side. There it goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6538)|
| 1:49:10| Yes, you can take action on the 17th lot if you'd like to. They're well underneath their density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6550)|
| 1:49:16| limits. It's not really going to impact anything else that they're proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6556)|
| 1:49:26| It's behind the houses. It's not closer to the road and all those types of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6566)|
| 1:49:33| Okay, so with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6573)|
| 1:49:37| I'm going to make a motion that we deny the variance number one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6577)|
| 1:49:41| per staff recommendation and approve variance number two per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6581)|
| 1:49:44| I second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6584)|
| 1:49:47| Before we go to vote, Commissioner Schelso.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6587)|
| 1:49:49| Are these proposed street names, like placeholders? Do they meet the condition of street names,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6589)|
| 1:49:56| monkey, mouse, and fuzzy shunk way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6596)|
| 1:50:07| I don't know the answer to that. Mr. Roberts, can you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6607)|
| 1:50:11| I don't know what a shunk is, but Urban Dictionary has maybe a less than flattering definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6611)|
| 1:50:15| I mean, it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6615)|
| 1:50:23| The rest of us are too old to have the Urban Dictionary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6623)|
| 1:50:26| Good afternoon. I'm Chad Roberts. Monkey Mouse is a name that I named my daughter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6626)|
| 1:50:33| A fuzzy shunk is I've got a six-year-old son. This is like a made-up name that a five-year-old| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6633)|
| 1:50:39| came up with. It's a funny family name is all it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6639)|
| 1:50:46| I guess, is it appropriate for a road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6646)|
| 1:50:52| It doesn't seem that shunk is appropriate for a road based on Urban Dictionary's definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6652)|
| 1:50:57| Well, it's a five-year-old that came up with the name, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6657)|
| 1:51:02| We're not, as Director Brooks brought up, we're not approving the road names at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6662)|
| 1:51:09| All right. I just have a question about the access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6669)|
| 1:51:16| The, just being in the curve there, and I noticed that there is, the property does go down and meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6676)|
| 1:51:23| the road further south. You can't really see it on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6683)|
| 1:51:27| the site plan, but you can see it on the property map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6687)|
| 1:51:32| But I'm just curious why the access was put here and said it does seem like there were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6692)|
| 1:51:36| some complaints around, or fears, concerns around a blind curve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6696)|
| 1:51:41| Yeah, Mr. Campbell, we had to answer that question. He was the one that designed the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6701)|
| 1:51:48| Robert Campbell, 7523 Taggart. We basically put it there because the low area of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6708)|
| 1:51:54| is where we have that detention pond shown, and we didn't want to put the road through where that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6714)|
| 1:52:00| low area was so that we could get the water to grade there. We are going to have to grade around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6720)|
| 1:52:04| the curve, but the road does come up the hill, and that's why we put the easement on it. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6724)|
| 1:52:09| we were trying to avoid the low area because we understand, as the community said, there's a small| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6729)|
| 1:52:14| pop that comes under the road, and we're going to have to really over-detain on that side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6734)|
| 1:52:19| to be able to get, to reduce the flow to where they're not getting any more than they are now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6739)|
| 1:52:24| And so I didn't want to put it right in the low spot and kind of mess up what that low area is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6744)|
| 1:52:32| intended to do, which is collect the water so that we could take it off. But we've got a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6752)|
| 1:52:38| playing around work to do to verify that all that works, but that was the reason we agreed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6758)|
| 1:52:45| Thank you. Mr. Campbell. Commissioner Newton, in your motion, can you repeat your motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6765)|
| 1:52:51| and make sure you include the alternative design standards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6771)|
| 1:52:56| So my motion was that we deny variance number one based on staff recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6776)|
| 1:53:01| and approve variance number two as requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6781)|
| 1:53:05| And the request?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6785)|
| 1:53:06| Because it will not propose, the proposal will not create a safety hazard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6786)|
| 1:53:13| But you need to include in the alternative design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6793)|
| 1:53:17| Approve variance number two and the requested alternative design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6797)|
| 1:53:20| Yes, sir. Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6800)|
| 1:53:22| Because they will not propose, the proposal won't create a safety hazard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6802)|
| 1:53:26| Thank you. Commissioner Adams, you second that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6806)|
| 1:53:30| We have a motion and a second to approve, to deny variance one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6810)|

| 1:53:44| All in favor of the motion, say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6824)|

| 1:55:43| Would you like opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6943)|
| 1:55:44| I'd like to proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6944)|
| 1:55:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6946)|

| 1:55:52| I'm representing here on behalf of Harper Collision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6952)|
| 1:55:56| The proposed use for the property is a certified collision center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6956)|
| 1:56:00| Prior to ever submitting this application, getting the call from a client,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6960)|
| 1:56:05| researching the ordinance, looking at the property, looking at the surrounding area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6965)|
| 1:56:10| at that point we contacted planning staff and Knox County COs to sit down to have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6970)|
| 1:56:16| kind of a preliminary informal review meeting to let them know what our proposed use is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6976)|
| 1:56:22| At that meeting, we outlined what would take place at the certified collision center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6982)|
| 1:56:28| This is not your standard body shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6988)|
| 1:56:30| It is a highly technological facility that basically remanufactures and rebuilds or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6990)|
| 1:56:38| reassembles damaged automobiles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=6998)|
| 1:56:42| Automobiles today, I think everybody would agree, are highly technical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7002)|
| 1:56:46| Harper Collision is one of the only certified collision centers in the state to work on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7006)|
| 1:56:55| Teslas, to work on these hybrid vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7015)|
| 1:56:59| In meeting with Ms. Brooks, planning staff, Mr. Elliot, Mr. Snowden, and reviewing the BP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7019)|
| 1:57:06| zoning ordinance, it was noted that a wide range of uses are permitted within this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7026)|
| 1:57:13| There is a very detailed list, a lengthy list, but in no way an exhaustive list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7033)|
| 1:57:19| And that's evidenced by one of the permitted uses that's set forth is that it involves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7039)|
| 1:57:27| the assembly or limited manufacturing when located according to a plan providing for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7047)|
| 1:57:33| aesthetic or other conditions in harmony with the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7053)|
| 1:57:36| So, when you look at the permitted uses, it's referring to automobile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7056)|
| 1:57:40| manufacturing, assembling type uses throughout the BP zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7060)|
| 1:57:45| And then when you apply this permitted use, that is where Ms. Brooks, Mr. Elliot, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7065)|
| 1:57:55| Snowden all agreed that this would be an appropriate use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7075)|
| 1:58:01| Knox County Codes is tasked with interpreting what uses are permitted within a zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7081)|
| 1:58:05| ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7085)|
| 1:58:06| They're tasked with doing that on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7086)|
| 1:58:08| Somebody comes and submits for a building permit, they look to see what the permitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7088)|
| 1:58:13| uses are, they use their judgment in interpreting the ordinance to determine whether they can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7093)|
| 1:58:18| in fact issue a building permit as a permitted use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7098)|
| 1:58:21| And that's what we have here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7101)|
| 1:58:23| As far as the use on review, we've gone through an exhaustive and detailed process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7103)|
| 1:58:28| because this is in the technology overlay, the TTCDA district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7108)|
| 1:58:32| We had a meeting there Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7112)|
| 1:58:34| When you develop in that district, they're required to be, obviously the approval, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7114)|
| 1:58:41| with that comes a lot more detailed plans that are reviewed and building plans, facades,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7121)|
| 1:58:47| site layout, landscaping, setbacks, buffering, and those plans were approved by the TTCDA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7127)|
| 1:58:58| We must also have, and that's why we're here today, is for the use on review approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7138)|
| 1:59:02| We submit that when applying those use on review standards that the use is considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7142)|
| 1:59:06| with the adopted, is consistent with the adopted plans and policies in harmony with the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7146)|
| 1:59:11| ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7151)|
| 1:59:12| It's compatible with the character of this neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7152)|
| 1:59:15| There are other collision type centers in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7155)|
| 1:59:21| There are offices, construction offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7161)|
| 1:59:25| There are apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7165)|
| 1:59:26| I mean, there's a wide range of uses in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7166)|
| 1:59:30| I don't believe that the use is going to cause any significant or injury to any adjacent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7170)|
| 1:59:35| properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7175)|
| 1:59:36| And one of the other standards is that there will not be any increase of traffic through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7176)|
| 1:59:41| any residential areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7181)|
| 1:59:42| Now, my understanding is that the opposition is a neighbor down the street, which is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7182)|
| 1:59:46| FedEx distribution center that is opposing this proposed use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7186)|
| 1:59:51| I would point out that our adjacent property neighbor, Merritt Construction, has in fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7191)|
| 1:59:59| submitted comments of support, welcoming this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7199)|
| 2:00:03| I think Mr. Buddy Hines is here, if there are questions for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7203)|
| 2:00:06| But we've met with him, done due diligence and advised him what the proposal is, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7206)|
| 2:00:10| he's welcoming it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7210)|
| 2:00:17| I'd like to reserve the remaining of my time to answer any kind of rebuttal questions that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7217)|
| 2:00:22| arise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7222)|
| 2:00:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7223)|
| 2:00:25| Thank you, Mr. Forster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7225)|
| 2:00:26| Mr. Sanders, your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7226)|
| 2:00:28| You have up to five minutes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7228)|
| 2:00:30| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7230)|
| 2:00:31| Daniel Sanders, Lowe, Yeager & Brown, 900 South Gate Street, Suite 2102.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7231)|
| 2:00:37| We do represent EF Knoxville and owns adjacent property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7237)|
| 2:00:45| A euphemism, members of the commission, is a mild or indirect word or expression that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7245)|
| 2:00:52| we substitute for one considered to be too harsh or blunt when referring to something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7252)|
| 2:00:57| that's unpleasant or embarrassing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7257)|
| 2:01:01| One example is when a car salesman says that a vehicle is pre-owned or certified pre-owned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7261)|
| 2:01:08| And I think in this case, we're calling a body shop or a motor vehicle repair shop a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7268)|
| 2:01:15| certified collision center, or even as the memorandum that you have in front of you says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7275)|
| 2:01:21| a remanufacturing facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7281)|
| 2:01:23| It would be unpleasant or embarrassing for Harper to refer to its business as a motor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7283)|
| 2:01:31| vehicle repair shop because motor vehicle repair shops are not permitted within the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7291)|
| 2:01:35| BP zone, business park and technology zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7295)|
| 2:01:41| Motor vehicle, well, so they call it remanufacturing, hoping that no one's going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7301)|
| 2:01:48| notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7308)|
| 2:01:49| But the truth is that Harper Collision Center is a motor vehicle repair shop and you don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7309)|
| 2:01:55| have to take my word for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7315)|
| 2:01:57| I want you to listen to this video.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7317)|
| 2:02:01| My name is Shannon Harper and I'm the president of Harper Auto Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7321)|
| 2:02:05| If in the event that you're in an accident and one of your cars you purchased from Harper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7325)|
| 2:02:08| Auto Square, the first thing you need to do is contact the team here at Harper Collision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7328)|
| 2:02:13| A lot of people don't know that in the state of Tennessee, you, the consumer, has the right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7333)|
| 2:02:18| to choose the body shop of your choice, not the insurance company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7338)|
| 2:02:22| Don't let the insurance company bully you into thinking that you have to use a preferred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7342)|
| 2:02:26| network body shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7346)|
| 2:02:28| Tell your insurance agent that you would like your vehicle repaired at a certified collision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7348)|
| 2:02:32| center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7352)|
| 2:02:33| Our team at Harper Collision Center is certified by the manufacturer to return your vehicle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7353)|
| 2:02:38| to pre-accident condition using OEM parts by factory trained technicians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7358)|
| 2:02:44| Our core focus is our customer satisfaction and happiness, not the insurance company profits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7364)|
| 2:02:50| So if you ever find yourself in the situation of needing collision repair, please remember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7370)|
| 2:02:55| to call the certified team at Harper Collision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7375)|
| 2:03:02| So if you care to, we've cited that in our letter to the commission and it's available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7382)|
| 2:03:06| on the Harper Collision Center webpage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7386)|
| 2:03:09| So the Knox County zoning ordinance defines motor vehicle repair and service as a business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7389)|
| 2:03:15| that provides repair services for motor vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7395)|
| 2:03:18| Harper Collision operates a motor vehicle repair shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7398)|
| 2:03:23| These services are specifically permitted in the CA and CB zones and likely in the PC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7403)|
| 2:03:30| zone, but not in the BP zone where this property is located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7410)|
| 2:03:34| So the BP zone does permit, as Mr. Taylor mentioned, manufacturing of automobile components| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7414)|
| 2:03:44| and other assembly of similar nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7424)|
| 2:03:49| Manufacturing and motor vehicle repair are not similar because the zoning ordinance treats| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7429)|
| 2:03:54| them differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7434)|
| 2:03:57| And there's no proof that Harper Collision is engaged in any kind of manufacturing, except| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7437)|
| 2:04:02| in what my clients see as an intentionally misleading memorandum that Harper Collision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7442)|
| 2:04:08| has submitted to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7448)|
| 2:04:11| So if you go to that part of the BP ordinance and you look and you say, well, is this going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7451)|
| 2:04:16| to be manufacturing of car components or is this going to be some sort of similar assembly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7456)|
| 2:04:24| Number one, you're going to have to ask, well, what's being assembled?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7464)|
| 2:04:26| And is that something that we should acknowledge as a separate use or is this an auto body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7466)|
| 2:04:32| repair shop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7472)|
| 2:04:34| I think it's an auto body repair shop and the proof before you is overwhelming, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7474)|
| 2:04:39| There's no mention of any sort of manufacturing on Harper's webpage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7479)|
| 2:04:46| In the words of the owner of the business, it's a body shop and they use that term interchangeably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7486)|
| 2:04:52| with collision center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7492)|
| 2:04:54| So there's not any sort of manufacturing going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7494)|
| 2:04:56| There's not any sort of other assembly that's similar to any of the other uses that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7496)|
| 2:05:00| permitted in this zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7500)|
| 2:05:02| And you don't even get to whether this use is similar if you don't establish some kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7502)|
| 2:05:08| of connection between another permitted use and this use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7508)|
| 2:05:11| So we would respectfully ask that this commission reject that euphemism of collision center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7511)|
| 2:05:22| or remanufacturing facility and acknowledge that this is an auto body repair shop, one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7522)|
| 2:05:30| that's not permitted in the zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7530)|
| 2:05:34| And thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7534)|
| 2:05:34| If you've got any questions, I'm happy to answer them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7534)|
| 2:05:37| Thank you, Mr. Sanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7537)|
| 2:05:46| Again, what staff report notes is that it's falling under, it's permitted use under the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7546)|
| 2:05:51| assembly of a similar type use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7551)|
| 2:05:55| So manufacturing automobile parts, manufacturing of automobile parts is a permitted use, therefore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7555)|
| 2:06:00| the assembly of manufactured auto parts is what the staff report is saying is a similar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7560)|
| 2:06:06| use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7566)|
| 2:06:07| I think everybody could agree that a wrecked vehicle being reassembled with automobile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7567)|
| 2:06:13| parts would fall under this permitted use category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7573)|
| 2:06:18| Again, we fall on the decision of Knox County Codes planning staff in interpreting our zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7578)|
| 2:06:28| ordinances for us on a daily basis and that's who's made the interpretation here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7588)|
| 2:06:33| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7593)|
| 2:06:34| Thank you, Mr. Forrest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7594)|
| 2:06:38| Chair recognizes questioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7598)|
| 2:06:41| I have a question for the opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7601)|
| 2:06:44| I'm going to try and phrase this correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7604)|
| 2:06:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7606)|
| 2:06:47| Terminology seems really important in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7607)|
| 2:06:50| If your opposition is to the appropriateness of the usage in the zone, what is the actual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7610)|
| 2:07:06| concern?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7626)|
| 2:07:10| I hear you saying that it's the zone and you do not feel that this is appropriate activity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7630)|
| 2:07:14| in the zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7634)|
| 2:07:16| I'm curious about what activity is going to take place that you're truly concerned about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7636)|
| 2:07:23| Well, as this commission should be well advised, a violation of a zoning ordinance is a per| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7643)|
| 2:07:32| se injury to other property owners that are adjacent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7652)|
| 2:07:39| Let's say, for instance, if the planning commission were to approve this on the understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7659)|
| 2:07:47| that it's some sort of assembly or manufacturing and they move there and they engage in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7667)|
| 2:07:55| use and it turns out it's like I say it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7675)|
| 2:07:58| It's a body shop and they're just repairing cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7678)|
| 2:08:01| Well, my client could come across the street and say you're violating the zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7681)|
| 2:08:08| because auto body repair is not permitted in this zone and could get an injunction to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7688)|
| 2:08:15| prohibit that use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7695)|
| 2:08:17| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7697)|
| 2:08:19| You don't have authority or discretion to approve the use that's not permitted in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7699)|
| 2:08:23| zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7703)|
| 2:08:24| It would harm my client to even try to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7704)|
| 2:08:28| I understand what you are saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7708)|
| 2:08:31| I'm asking for a corollary for all the cases that we've heard up until this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7711)|
| 2:08:36| We've been talking about opposition that is speaking to concern of flooding, concern of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7716)|
| 2:08:44| changing the nature of the place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7724)|
| 2:08:46| These are the kinds of concerns that persons have expressed about an applicant and I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7726)|
| 2:08:51| looking for something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7731)|
| 2:08:54| Absolutely, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7734)|
| 2:08:56| The nature of this place, this zone, this business and technology park zone is established| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7736)|
| 2:09:02| by the uses that are permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7742)|
| 2:09:05| That is the character of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7745)|
| 2:09:07| If you allow something that's not permitted, it necessarily changes the character of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7747)|
| 2:09:13| Auto body shops aren't permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7753)|
| 2:09:15| If you allow an auto body shop, it changes the character of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7755)|
| 2:09:20| My clients would look to this commission to be a gatekeeper of sorts and make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7760)|
| 2:09:27| that the uses that are permitted are furthered and encouraged and nurtured by disallowing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7767)|
| 2:09:37| uses that aren't permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7777)|
| 2:09:39| If the county commission thinks that this is overly harsh, then obviously they can amend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7779)|
| 2:09:47| the zoning ordinance and include motor vehicle repair in the business and technology park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7787)|
| 2:09:54| zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7794)|
| 2:09:54| But until they do that, this is not a permitted use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7794)|
| 2:09:59| My clients would just stand on the fact that a violation of the zone or authorization to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7799)|
| 2:10:06| engage in a use that's not permitted in the zone is a per se harm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7806)|
| 2:10:09| Before I open it up to Commissioner Newton and Commissioner Roth, Ms. Brooks, do you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7809)|
| 2:10:19| want to weigh in on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7819)|
| 2:10:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7821)|
| 2:10:22| Thank you, Chairman Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7822)|
| 2:10:24| The county zoning administrator made the decision that the use proposed by Harper was a use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7824)|
| 2:10:30| that could be considered in the BP zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7830)|
| 2:10:33| I know this is a fine line, but whether or not the use is permitted in the BP zone is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7833)|
| 2:10:39| not the decision before this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7839)|
| 2:10:42| So if the opposition would like to appeal the zoning administrator's decision, it should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7842)|
| 2:10:47| be appealed to the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7847)|
| 2:10:50| The decision before you today is whether or not the use is appropriate for the specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7850)|
| 2:10:54| location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7854)|
| 2:10:55| Again, I know that's a fine line, but you're not charged with determining whether or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7855)|
| 2:11:01| the use is a use that is permitted in this zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7861)|
| 2:11:06| The zoning administrator is tasked with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7866)|
| 2:11:09| You are tasked with determining whether or not this use is appropriate at this specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7869)|
| 2:11:13| location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7873)|
| 2:11:17| May I ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7877)|
| 2:11:21| No, not right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7881)|
| 2:11:23| The commission's tasked with discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7883)|
| 2:11:26| Chair recognizes Commissioner Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7886)|
| 2:11:29| I was going to ask the county, you're usually tasked with uses and determining and defining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7889)|
| 2:11:35| what uses fall into what category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7895)|
| 2:11:39| You guys have met and looked at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7899)|
| 2:11:42| Jim or Steve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7902)|
| 2:11:43| Yes, we met with the applicant prior to him applying for the use on review, and we felt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7903)|
| 2:11:49| like it fit under Section R of the other assembly, limited manufacturing uses of similar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7909)|
| 2:11:53| nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7913)|
| 2:11:54| I mean, in Knox County, when we have a problem with uses and application to zoning and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7914)|
| 2:12:01| compliance, you guys are the authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7921)|
| 2:12:04| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7924)|
| 2:12:06| You've made a determination it's appropriate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7926)|
| 2:12:08| Yes, we think it's in harmony with the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7928)|
| 2:12:13| Commissioner Adams?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7933)|
| 2:12:15| Yes, this is to Director Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7935)|
| 2:12:19| Apologies, I just need a little more clarification because I'm confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7939)|
| 2:12:22| Because it's a use on review case, but we've been told that the use is being approved for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7942)|
| 2:12:31| the zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7951)|
| 2:12:32| That's not what we are discussing right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7952)|
| 2:12:35| The zoning administrator has made the decision that this use is one that can be considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7955)|
| 2:12:41| in the BP zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7961)|
| 2:12:44| It can be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7964)|
| 2:12:44| It can be, but it still needs to come before you all as a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7964)|
| 2:12:50| Okay, I would just like to make the comment, thinking I understand, that the plan that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7970)|
| 2:13:02| has been proposed by the applicant, to me, does seem like it fits in this area because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7982)|
| 2:13:10| this area is not a human scale kind of area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7990)|
| 2:13:13| This is a technology park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7993)|
| 2:13:17| This is where research, manufacturing, et cetera, is supposed to be happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=7997)|
| 2:13:22| And that appears to be what this plan is about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8002)|
| 2:13:27| It's not on a human scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8007)|
| 2:13:28| It's on a different type of scale, and it seems to fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8008)|
| 2:13:32| That's my feeling on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8012)|
| 2:13:35| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8015)|
| 2:13:38| Commissioner Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8018)|
| 2:13:40| That's for Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8020)|
| 2:13:41| His life's not working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8021)|
| 2:13:44| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8024)|
| 2:13:45| Thank you, Chair Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8025)|
| 2:13:48| I think the issue is clear here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8028)|
| 2:13:52| We're going to be weighing in on not an auto repair, but we're not disputing, we're not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8032)|
| 2:13:57| questioning, we're not interpreting anything other than what the zoning administrator has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8037)|
| 2:14:02| basically put before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8042)|
| 2:14:04| Isn't that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8044)|
| 2:14:04| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8044)|
| 2:14:05| Well, in that case, I'd like to make a motion to approve the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8045)|
| 2:14:10| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8050)|
| 2:14:10| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8050)|
| 2:14:12| Okay, we've got more seconds than we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8052)|
| 2:14:14| We have a motion by Commissioner Hill, second by Commissioner Schelso to approve the request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8054)|
| 2:14:20| for an office warehouse development in the planned commercial business park zone, subject| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8060)|
| 2:14:25| to the five conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8065)|
| 2:14:28| Your light is on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8068)|
| 2:14:28| You want to say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8068)|
| 2:14:30| Yeah, we had the commission going on before Mr. Saunders was wanting to ask his question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8070)|
| 2:14:36| and before I take a vote, is there anything material that you're asking, or are we good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8076)|
| 2:14:40| Nope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8080)|
| 2:14:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8081)|
| 2:14:41| All right, I'm ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8081)|
| 2:14:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8083)|
| 2:14:43| All in favor of the motion, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8083)|
| 2:14:46| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8086)|
| 2:14:46| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8086)|
| 2:14:47| Motion carries unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8087)|
| 2:14:49| Thank you, Mr. Forrester and Mr. Sander.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8089)|
| 2:14:54| Next is agenda item number 32.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8094)|
| 2:14:58| File 4 SB22F, resubdivision of the Jerry L. Price property, applicant developer is Terry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8098)|
| 2:15:06| Romans, location west of East Governor John Sear Highway, abutting the French Broad River.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8106)|
| 2:15:14| Approximate acreage is 1.31 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8114)|
| 2:15:17| Zoning is agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8117)|
| 2:15:19| Staff's recommendation, approve the variance reducing the right-of-way width to 25 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8119)|
| 2:15:25| wide so that it matches up with the longer portion of the previously approved 20-foot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8125)|
| 2:15:30| wide joint permanent easements, since there is not much distance left before the access terminates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8130)|
| 2:15:37| and approve the subdivision plat because it is in compliance with the subdivision regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8137)|
| 2:15:42| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8142)|
| 2:15:44| Mr. Romans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8144)|
| 2:15:47| I guess he's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8147)|
| 2:15:48| Is there the opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8148)|
| 2:15:50| Mr. Brooks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8150)|
| 2:15:52| Would you like to come up, please, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8152)|
| 2:15:54| State your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8154)|
| 2:15:58| Tony Brooks, 1924 East Governor John Sear Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8158)|
| 2:16:02| Could you pull the mic a little closer to you, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8162)|
| 2:16:04| You have up to five minutes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8164)|
| 2:16:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8166)|
| 2:16:07| Tony Brooks, 1924 East Governor John Sear Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8167)|
| 2:16:12| My driveway is directly across from this driveway, and there's no way I've been down that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8172)|
| 2:16:21| It's a driveway like my driveway and everybody else's that live off the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8181)|
| 2:16:24| It's quite a ways, and it's rock and gravel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8184)|
| 2:16:28| No improvements have been done to this driveway since I've lived there in 40 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8188)|
| 2:16:32| and now they want to do away with the turnaround, which they don't have anyway to start with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8192)|
| 2:16:38| There's no place to turn around down there without getting on somebody else's property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8198)|
| 2:16:43| driving on their property, their driveway, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8203)|
| 2:16:46| I can see the 25-foot driveway, because that's what mine is, and that's typical of that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8206)|
| 2:16:53| But I don't see doing away with the turnaround.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8213)|
| 2:16:58| He needs to do a turnaround down there, because if a fire truck gets down in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8218)|
| 2:17:07| he has to back down a boat ramp that is private, and you're not supposed to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8227)|
| 2:17:14| And so I asked you all to make sure that he does the turnaround for the safety of the people that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8234)|
| 2:17:23| do live down in that area, and really, he needs to do something for the entranceway of that driveway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8243)|
| 2:17:33| because it really comes out in a bad spot, and there's no way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8253)|
| 2:17:40| You have to pull right into the driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8260)|
| 2:17:42| There's no shoulders to veer off into the driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8262)|
| 2:17:46| He needs to do something to address that problem right there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8266)|
| 2:17:49| and he needs to put a turnaround down at the bottom at the end of the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8269)|
| 2:17:54| for the safety of all the people that live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8274)|
| 2:17:57| And I thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8277)|
| 2:17:58| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8278)|
| 2:17:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8279)|
| 2:18:12| Any comments from the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8292)|
| 2:18:28| Is it just a single house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8308)|
| 2:18:32| And so they could turn into the driveway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8312)|
| 2:18:34| Fire truck needed to come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8314)|
| 2:18:36| Could they turn into the driveway and turn back around?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8316)|
| 2:18:39| Ms. Porche?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8319)|
| 2:18:40| Yeah, I can speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8320)|
| 2:18:42| What they're requesting to do is just extend the right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8322)|
| 2:18:47| So the property was originally platted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8327)|
| 2:18:50| You can see the driveway that's using now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8330)|
| 2:18:54| That driveway was platted, I believe, in 2013, if I'm remembering correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8334)|
| 2:19:01| A separate right-of-way was platted leading to this property through the larger portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8341)|
| 2:19:08| of the parcel in anticipation of a subdivision, a larger subdivision that never came to fruition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8348)|
| 2:19:15| So this is proposing to plat the existing driveway that they're already using that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220512?start=8355)|
