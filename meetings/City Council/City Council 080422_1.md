| 2:27:05| and we are going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8825)|
| 2:27:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8826)|
| 2:27:07| Because what I was concerned about was our citizens' use of this system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8827)|
| 2:27:11| and, you know, is there an accommodation for someone who's Spanish speaking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8831)|
| 2:27:15| Can they push number 2, for example?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8835)|
| 2:27:17| We hadn't taken that into consideration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8837)|
| 2:27:20| but it's something that's very easy to do because it's all automated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8840)|
| 2:27:24| I mean, I would like for as many folks as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8844)|
| 2:27:26| now that we're upgrading our system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8846)|
| 2:27:28| to be able to use this automatically and not have to sit on hold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8848)|
| 2:27:30| and that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8850)|
| 2:27:31| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8851)|
| 2:27:32| My concern was from the user standpoint, not the voice that you hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8852)|
| 2:27:36| And we do have a web option with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8856)|
| 2:27:38| where one can pay your court funds on the web, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8858)|
| 2:27:42| which I think will be a big improvement in efficiency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8862)|
| 2:27:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8865)|
| 2:27:46| That answers my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8866)|
| 2:27:47| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8867)|
| 2:27:48| The people who sit near me in church will be thrilled to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8868)|
| 2:27:51| you could choose another voice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8871)|
| 2:27:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8874)|

| 2:28:23| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8903)|
| 2:28:24| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8904)|
| 2:28:25| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8905)|
| 2:28:26| I just wanted to recognize Ms. Rojero and her staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8906)|
| 2:28:28| We had a workshop on this topic last Thursday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8908)|
| 2:28:31| and went over the plan very thoroughly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8911)|
| 2:28:33| And I just want to say publicly thank you to Ms. Rojero| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8913)|
| 2:28:37| and the whole Community Development Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8917)|
| 2:28:39| I know a lot of folks put a lot of hours into this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8919)|
| 2:28:41| I feel so much better about it than I did about the plan several years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8921)|
| 2:28:45| I think the department and the city have made some really tough decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8925)|
| 2:28:50| to limit the applications and to really make the plan focused and strategic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8930)|
| 2:28:57| We talked at our workshop about how difficult it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8937)|
| 2:29:00| when folks and projects that are very worthwhile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8940)|
| 2:29:04| are not funded in subsequent years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8944)|
| 2:29:06| But I think that that pruning, so to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8946)|
| 2:29:09| is going to make a stronger program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8949)|
| 2:29:13| It's strategic and it's focused on our highest priorities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8953)|
| 2:29:16| and it also, I think, does an excellent job of leveraging those federal dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8956)|
| 2:29:20| in terms of matching them with other opportunities here locally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8960)|
| 2:29:23| and leveraging other opportunities to help the most people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8963)|
| 2:29:26| And I wanted to recognize you, and thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8966)|
| 2:29:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8968)|
| 2:29:29| I'd like to make sure we recognize Becky Wade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8969)|
| 2:29:31| who's our Community Development Administrator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8971)|
| 2:29:33| She's done a lot of the work and also sat through this meeting, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8973)|
| 2:29:39| Mr. Hawkless, what she said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8979)|
| 2:29:42| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8982)|

| 2:29:45| We agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=8985)|

| 2:31:01| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9061)|
| 2:31:02| I just want to send out a big thank you to the engineering department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9062)|
| 2:31:04| for getting the community involved positively in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9064)|
| 2:31:07| It was wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9067)|
| 2:31:08| At one point we had a public meeting where I think they were going to kill people in engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9068)|
| 2:31:12| and the last meeting they had they applauded them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9072)|
| 2:31:14| So it's a wonderful piece of work for the engineers especially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9074)|
| 2:31:19| I think it's also worth noting, and I agree with you, I think it's a great job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9079)|
| 2:31:23| but it's also worth noting that the changes and all that don't come without a price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9083)|
| 2:31:27| I think it's a good investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9087)|
| 2:31:30| We basically reacted, but it did cost us the extra money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9090)|
| 2:31:32| and then ongoing it will cost us probably an extra $30,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9092)|
| 2:31:37| It's the right decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9097)|
| 2:31:38| We made it, but it's just you need to note that there's a cost to everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9098)|
| 2:31:43| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9103)|

| 2:34:33| for property located on the southeast side of Washington Pike, southwest side of Mill Road, 4th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9273)|
| 2:34:39| Anyone signed up for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9279)|
| 2:34:43| I talked to Mrs. Nichols yesterday and today a number of times, and she was –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9283)|
| 2:34:49| Oh, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9289)|
| 2:34:52| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9292)|
| 2:34:54| If you could give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9294)|
| 2:34:59| Kelly Nichols, 6320 Old Washington Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9299)|
| 2:35:03| The one-year plan amendment, if I'm not mistaken, was approved earlier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9303)|
| 2:35:08| No, this is a one-year plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9308)|
| 2:35:10| Was that not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9310)|
| 2:35:11| That's next on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9311)|
| 2:35:12| If I could address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9312)|
| 2:35:14| The one-year plan, the annual one-year plan amendments that you approved earlier on the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9314)|
| 2:35:21| amended this particular area to include neighborhood centers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9321)|
| 2:35:26| as part of the mixed-use district that's described.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9326)|
| 2:35:29| So this plan amendment becomes moot because we've changed the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9329)|
| 2:35:35| So should we withdraw?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9335)|
| 2:35:37| You would say we withdraw this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9337)|
| 2:35:39| You can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9339)|
| 2:35:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9344)|
| 2:35:45| Well, let me get some clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9345)|
| 2:35:47| I'm glad we waited until 930 to bring this one up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9347)|
| 2:35:49| That was a good move, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9349)|
| 2:35:52| Okay, so – but now it's my understanding that there's some potential opposition to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9352)|
| 2:36:02| I guess let's hear what folks have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9362)|
| 2:36:04| Then we might come back because we certainly could, at the same meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9364)|
| 2:36:09| take five votes to reconsider the previously passed one-year plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9369)|
| 2:36:13| if necessary, to take this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9373)|
| 2:36:16| Does anyone have a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9376)|
| 2:36:19| No, but I think we should hear that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9379)|
| 2:36:21| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9381)|
| 2:36:24| Ms. Nichols, would you like –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9384)|
| 2:36:27| Can I say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9387)|
| 2:36:28| Yeah, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9388)|
| 2:36:29| Yeah, my name is Michael DiPietro, 7601 Mace Chapel Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9389)|
| 2:36:32| We are not in opposition to this proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9392)|
| 2:36:36| We are for this proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9396)|
| 2:36:38| So we are the parties that are trying to get the property rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9398)|
| 2:36:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9403)|
| 2:36:44| So everyone here is in favor of the proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9404)|
| 2:36:48| The opposition called me at the last minute and said that she would not be attending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9408)|
| 2:36:52| Could everyone identify themselves, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9412)|
| 2:36:55| Sure, if you'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9415)|
| 2:36:57| I'm Shirley Harris, 5652 Washington Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9417)|
| 2:37:01| I am one of the owners of the piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9421)|
| 2:37:04| Current owner of the piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9424)|
| 2:37:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9425)|
| 2:37:09| I am Julian Harris, 5652 Washington Pike, and I live at –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9429)|
| 2:37:13| I'm one of the people who live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9433)|
| 2:37:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9435)|
| 2:37:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9436)|
| 2:37:18| Let me ask some questions here because I talked to Mrs. Nichols.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9438)|
| 2:37:22| She's always been great about being real responsive and real communicative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9442)|
| 2:37:27| Mr. Anderson, we played phone tag yesterday, and you left me a voicemail concerning this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9447)|
| 2:37:36| Is there opposition, as you understand it, considering your family's proximity to the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9456)|
| 2:37:42| I think what happened, Mrs. Nichols showed them a potential plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9462)|
| 2:37:46| and sometime later, late this afternoon, they were in agreement that the plan was fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9466)|
| 2:37:51| as she had shown them in the opposition with Ms. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9471)|
| 2:37:54| I think what she just relayed –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9474)|
| 2:37:56| I didn't find out until I was on the way to the council meeting and I was late getting here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9476)|
| 2:38:00| I meant to talk to you about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9480)|
| 2:38:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9481)|
| 2:38:02| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9482)|
| 2:38:05| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9485)|
| 2:38:06| Yeah, this is a process question for Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9486)|
| 2:38:11| In the one-year plan update, we changed this whole area up here to a mixed use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9491)|
| 2:38:19| and we're doing another plan amendment here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9499)|
| 2:38:23| Should we be doing 12B at all, or is that – because that would change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9503)|
| 2:38:29| Just fill me in on what's – planning-wise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9509)|
| 2:38:33| One's a mixed use that includes neighborhood commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9513)|
| 2:38:36| and one is a plan amendment for neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9516)|
| 2:38:41| The mixed use was approved earlier on the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9521)|
| 2:38:45| so you would, in fact, be changing that to a specific neighborhood center designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9525)|
| 2:38:53| rather than the mixed use, which also has office and LI allowed in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9533)|
| 2:38:59| and is consistent with the sector plan, which was adopted a year ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9539)|
| 2:39:04| Now, let me ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9544)|
| 2:39:05| I know there have been discussions among a lot of the folks that live up there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9545)|
| 2:39:08| and some consensus that we're moving forward on commercial property going in up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9548)|
| 2:39:15| The planners have actually suggested a mixed use, which when we come to the zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9555)|
| 2:39:20| could include the C-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9560)|
| 2:39:22| Correct, Mr. Donaldson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9562)|
| 2:39:23| Right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9563)|
| 2:39:24| That can include C-1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9564)|
| 2:39:25| C-1, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9565)|
| 2:39:26| So, do you all have any problem of the plan amendment being for keeping it what it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9566)|
| 2:39:33| now that we've adopted this earlier in the meeting, a mixed use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9573)|
| 2:39:36| as opposed to a neighborhood commercial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9576)|
| 2:39:44| Does the mixed use include the neighborhood commercial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9584)|
| 2:39:46| Yes, it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9586)|
| 2:39:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9587)|
| 2:39:48| Then, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9588)|
| 2:39:49| So, I think 12B we should withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9589)|
| 2:39:55| I think that's right, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9595)|
| 2:39:58| Move to withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9598)|
| 2:39:59| You can do either one you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9599)|
| 2:40:00| You can either pass or withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9600)|
| 2:40:01| It doesn't make really any difference for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9601)|
| 2:40:03| Right now, the motion and the second is to withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9603)|
| 2:40:05| Any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9605)|
| 2:40:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9607)|
| 2:40:08| All those in favor, withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9608)|
| 2:40:09| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9609)|
| 2:40:10| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9610)|
| 2:40:11| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9611)|
| 2:40:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9612)|
| 2:40:13| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9613)|
| 2:40:14| 12C is an ordinance to rezone property located on the southeast side of Washington Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9614)|
| 2:40:17| southwest side of Mill Road, from R1 Low Density Residential District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9617)|
| 2:40:20| to C1 Neighborhood Commercial District, Kelly Nichols, Applicant, 4th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9620)|
| 2:40:25| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9625)|
| 2:40:27| Discussion on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9627)|
| 2:40:31| This is the zone that everybody wants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9631)|
| 2:40:34| This planning stuff that nobody quite understands can confuse people, but I think we got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9634)|
| 2:40:38| I took some time with Ms. Theora Jameson over the phone to talk about the different types of zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9638)|
| 2:40:44| and how this is probably the most neighborhood-friendly type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9644)|
| 2:40:50| You convinced her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9650)|
| 2:40:52| And I, again, reiterated the fact and went over with her the zoning ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9652)|
| 2:40:58| and explained to her how it will protect her if we do say we switch to the neighborhood commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9658)|
| 2:41:03| and everyone in here is in agreeance upon just that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9663)|
| 2:41:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9667)|

| 2:41:52| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9712)|
| 2:41:55| First of all, I'd like to say how much we appreciate all of you Councilmembers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9715)|
| 2:42:00| You have been faithful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9720)|
| 2:42:01| You have come to our meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9721)|
| 2:42:03| You have endured this three months with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9723)|
| 2:42:06| And you can't know how much we appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9726)|
| 2:42:10| Having said that, I have to say that we feel very disrespected right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9730)|
| 2:42:15| that we have spent three months of negotiations every time we'd come up with something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9735)|
| 2:42:20| And we have been trying to get the church to compromise with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9740)|
| 2:42:23| And those of you that have been at the meetings have seen that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9743)|
| 2:42:27| Now, all at once, this afternoon at 5 o'clock, they want to compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9747)|
| 2:42:33| If we don't make a decision, a huge decision for us, during a city council meeting, we're the bad guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9753)|
| 2:42:42| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9762)|
| 2:42:43| I mean, I just don't feel like that's fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9763)|
| 2:42:46| And, you know, we have talked to city engineering about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9766)|
| 2:42:50| They said it was very important about the road closure that we get this stuff down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9770)|
| 2:42:54| You know, that the wordage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9774)|
| 2:42:55| We got in that meeting and we realized that nobody in there had a copy of what you all have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9775)|
| 2:43:01| All I had was the three amendments or the five or whatever that Mr. Brown had given me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9781)|
| 2:43:06| We didn't even have a copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9786)|
| 2:43:07| We don't even know what's being proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9787)|
| 2:43:11| And, you know, I don't want to sound ungrateful, and I certainly don't sound like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9791)|
| 2:43:16| I'm not saying that we disagree with what they're planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9796)|
| 2:43:18| but I think we need to get a chance to line by line, go through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9798)|
| 2:43:23| And I don't think that's, I think any of you all, you're lawyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9803)|
| 2:43:26| You know you don't agree to something you don't even have in your hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9806)|
| 2:43:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9812)|
| 2:43:33| Right now on this item there's no motion on the table, just for clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9813)|
| 2:43:35| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9815)|
| 2:43:37| Let me say for Ms. O'Dell, what you have is what we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9817)|
| 2:43:40| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9820)|
| 2:43:41| There's nothing else other than the council agenda and the documents that you have from the very beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9821)|
| 2:43:49| What we're looking at is those same things that you guys have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9829)|
| 2:43:52| There's nothing new there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9832)|
| 2:43:54| So I want to make sure you don't think we've got something that you guys don't have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9834)|
| 2:43:59| You know, I'm sorry you guys feel that way, quite frankly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9839)|
| 2:44:07| And I hear you talking about engineering says get it down in writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9847)|
| 2:44:10| I think what engineering was saying to you is what you have in your hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9850)|
| 2:44:13| When they said get it down in writing, what they're talking about is what you have right there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9853)|
| 2:44:17| which is going to go into this record, which is going to go into the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9857)|
| 2:44:21| which is going to go to MPC, which is going to be a part of the official record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9861)|
| 2:44:24| So if there's any problem, as Mr. Swanson stated earlier, the city will step in and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9864)|
| 2:44:30| you're not doing right, now we're going to bring the engineering department or the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9870)|
| 2:44:35| or whoever else or codes out and make you do it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9875)|
| 2:44:38| So I think what engineering was telling you to get down in writing is what you have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9878)|
| 2:44:42| and it's what is going in the record today and what's going to amend the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9882)|
| 2:44:45| I don't think there's anything else that they would have been referring to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9885)|
| 2:44:48| So I want to make sure that, and I wasn't in on that discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9888)|
| 2:44:51| and I think when they said get it down in writing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9891)|
| 2:44:53| they was wanting you not to go into a meeting out at Eastminster or at your home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9893)|
| 2:44:59| or at the church somewhere and they tell you orally, this is what we're going to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9899)|
| 2:45:03| but don't get it in writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9903)|
| 2:45:05| So that's what I assume engineering meant by get it in writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9905)|
| 2:45:08| And that's what you have there, and that's what's going to be a part of the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9908)|
| 2:45:11| That's what's going to be a part of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9911)|
| 2:45:14| As everybody said, if they try to do any changes, do something wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9914)|
| 2:45:17| codes will come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9917)|
| 2:45:18| If they try to change anything, they've got to go through MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9918)|
| 2:45:21| They've got to send you guys letters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9921)|
| 2:45:23| They've got to go and do all that stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9923)|
| 2:45:25| So I don't know that there's any additional things in writing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9925)|
| 2:45:28| that engineering would have been talking about you getting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9928)|
| 2:45:31| And Mr. King is here, and maybe he knows what that discussion was about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9931)|
| 2:45:35| But I assume getting it in writing, it's what they meant right there, what you have there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9935)|
| 2:45:38| what we made them do, put it in writing and run it by Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9938)|
| 2:45:42| So, you know, those two issues that you just brought up about getting it in writing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9942)|
| 2:45:46| and then also about us maybe having something you guys don't have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9946)|
| 2:45:49| I wanted to clear up and tell you that we don't have anything you don't have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9949)|
| 2:45:52| and getting it in writing is what I worked real hard twisting on today to make sure they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9952)|
| 2:45:57| And you don't know how much we appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9957)|
| 2:45:59| I don't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9959)|
| 2:46:00| I don't know these terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9960)|
| 2:46:02| But I also know we were told that we needed a private deed restriction that would attach to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9962)|
| 2:46:09| And I'm just saying I wish we had known.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9969)|
| 2:46:13| Even this morning would have helped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9973)|
| 2:46:22| I'll propose these changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9982)|
| 2:46:25| I know there's been a lot of hard work, and I hope Ms. O'Dell, just as a church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9985)|
| 2:46:30| I've gotten a whole bunch of emails from the church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9990)|
| 2:46:32| I looked at my palm pile a few minutes ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9992)|
| 2:46:34| and I've got probably 40 emails that have come in this evening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9994)|
| 2:46:36| that I haven't had a chance to even take a look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9996)|
| 2:46:38| But, you know, I really do think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=9998)|
| 2:46:40| and it's not anything I didn't say earlier today in my discussions with Ms. O'Dell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=10000)|
| 2:46:44| with other folk, that what we have in front of us right now, I think, addresses her issues and concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=10004)|
| 2:46:51| It's in writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=10011)|
| 2:46:53| I think it is a good compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=10013)|
| 2:46:56| I think it really deals with some big issues that are, you know, I was just out there yesterday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=10016)|
| 2:47:01| went out again yesterday and drove around and looked on the other side of the church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=10021)|
| 2:47:05| and drove up, I guess, where they have the overhang part there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=10025)|
| 2:47:08| and maybe that's where the kids go out when they're leaving school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=10028)|
| 2:47:10| and looked at the hotel next door, and there's a creek back there to see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=10030)|
| 2:47:14| is there another way to cut across this property or find another access?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=10034)|
| 2:47:18| And I drove around the corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=10038)|
| 2:47:20| I stopped, and from that side of the church, which would have been the east side of the church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=10040)|
| 2:47:24| I looked up at the senior citizens' homes, and there are two stories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=10044)|
| 2:47:27| And I just had a vision that if those are two stories,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=10047)|
| 2:47:30| what is five stories going to look like on top of that hill, you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=10050)|
| 2:47:33| So we're dealing with that issue also here on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=10053)|
| 2:47:36| We have, I think, in front of us, I'm just so concerned that we will end up, once again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=10056)|
| 2:47:42| in a situation where we don't have as good a deal as we have here on agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=10062)|
| 2:47:46| and Arthur and the developer and everybody may be able to hold steady and hold tight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=10066)|
| 2:47:51| And you guys may say, hey, it works real well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=10071)|
| 2:47:53| but I am concerned that we may be missing a golden opportunity to get what I consider is a good deal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=10073)|
| 2:47:59| and the best deal, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=10079)|
| 2:48:01| We've all worked hard at it, quite frankly, Ms. O'Dell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=10081)|
| 2:48:05| And I'll say this, Arthur, as you hear that Ms. O'Dell is not, you know, it feels a little disrespected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=10085)|
| 2:48:11| I think that Keith Polk and the developer, Mr. Seymour, feel that I really leaned on them a little too hard today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=10091)|
| 2:48:17| You asked me earlier how did we get here to the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=10097)|
| 2:48:20| It's because, as he said, I leaned very hard on them today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=10100)|
| 2:48:23| And really, you know, I don't like to admit that because I want everybody to think I'm warm and fuzzy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=10103)|
| 2:48:28| But I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=10108)|
| 2:48:31| Motion fails for lack of a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=10111)|
| 2:48:34| I did lean and twist and push today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=10114)|
| 2:48:37| And I think we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=10117)|
| 2:48:38| And I think when it's all said and done, people are going to sit back and go, you know what, that did work out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=10118)|
| 2:48:43| So, you know, I don't know how council feels what they want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=10123)|
| 2:48:47| You know, I keep hearing all these statements about, you know, it's in your district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=10127)|
| 2:48:51| But every council member votes their own passion and votes their own feelings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=10131)|
| 2:48:55| And I'm very convinced of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=10135)|
| 2:48:57| And I do think I would like to move this to go ahead and have it passed tonight because I think we need to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=10137)|
| 2:49:02| And, you know, we'll go with it from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=10142)|
| 2:49:04| And if it doesn't, I hope it stays together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=10144)|
| 2:49:06| I hope any additional concerns or questions can get worked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=10146)|
| 2:49:10| But I'm at a juncture, as I've said earlier today, that I'd like to move this agreement here because I think it's a good one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=10150)|
| 2:49:16| And it's one that, you know, put a whole lot of hard work in to get here and, quite frankly, covered a lot of ground to get here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=10156)|
| 2:49:27| Is that a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=10167)|
| 2:49:28| That's a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=10168)|
| 2:49:31| Well, I guess it's a motion to help me out, Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=10171)|
| 2:49:34| I think your motion is to amend the conditions as provided and add the two additional conditions, which are not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=10174)|
| 2:49:45| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=10185)|
| 2:49:46| And then deny the remainder of the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=10186)|
| 2:49:48| Second that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=10188)|
| 2:49:49| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=10189)|
| 2:49:50| That's my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=10190)|
| 2:49:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=10191)|
| 2:49:52| That moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=10192)|
| 2:49:53| I don't need to list the numbers or anything, just what we have for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=10193)|
| 2:49:56| Ms. Mitchell, you already have a copy for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=10196)|
| 2:49:59| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=10199)|
| 2:50:01| And you've got the changes that Charles made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=10201)|
| 2:50:05| Now, I have added to that the suggestion by Mr. Hulquist, the wording accompanied by staff or salespersons at the bottom of number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=10205)|
| 2:50:18| I don't know whether there was ever a motion or a friendly amendment or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=10218)|
| 2:50:21| Friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080422?start=10221)|
