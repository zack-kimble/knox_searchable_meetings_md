| 0:00:00| I'm not sure about the status of counseling, camping, but thanks everybody for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=0)|
| 0:00:11| I know this is a long day and it takes away from what a lot of us would normally be doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=11)|
| 0:00:17| today, but it's obviously probably the most important charge that we have dealing with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=17)|
| 0:00:24| the budget here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=24)|
| 0:00:25| I don't have a whole lot to add to it at this point, but I would just ask that let's let| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=25)|
| 0:00:33| everybody present, do their presentation, hold your questions, write your questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=33)|
| 0:00:37| down until the end so that their presentation can flow fluidly and be mindful of their presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=37)|
| 0:00:48| So that's all that I have right now and we'll, who's, Dr. Lyons, you're going to do the opening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=48)|
| 0:00:58| Thanks for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=58)|
| 0:01:01| Thank you Mr. Vice Mayor and Council for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=61)|
| 0:01:04| This is your budget hearing, we're very well aware of that, and Mayor Rojero is unable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=64)|
| 0:01:08| to be here today, but she obviously feels very strongly that this is a sum budget, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=68)|
| 0:01:14| we all do, and responsible budget, and now it's in your hands to ask the questions that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=74)|
| 0:01:18| you need to do to evaluate it, and we're here to help you do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=78)|
| 0:01:22| So what we're having, Vice Mayor Pavlis mentioned the presentations, we're going to try to keep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=82)|
| 0:01:27| these as brief as possible and allow as much time for questions and answers as necessary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=87)|
| 0:01:33| but we will obviously defer to the wisdom of Council on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=93)|
| 0:01:37| So basically what we're going to do is, you see the program, we're going to begin with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=97)|
| 0:01:41| an overview, and I'm going to turn to my colleague, Deputy Christy Branscom, to start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=101)|
| 0:01:47| the overview, and she will then have Jim York get into some of the details that I know you'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=107)|
| 0:01:52| want to hear, so Christy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=112)|
| 0:01:58| Thank you Bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=118)|
| 0:01:59| So it's our goal today to provide Council with the most accurate, up-to-date, and complete| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=119)|
| 0:02:03| information that we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=123)|
| 0:02:04| Each of our department heads and managers will come up and give a brief summary of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=124)|
| 0:02:08| year, and overview their activities, and then be prepared to answer whatever questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=128)|
| 0:02:12| you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=132)|
| 0:02:13| As I commented last year at this hearing, I'm really proud of our very hardworking staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=133)|
| 0:02:17| Our directors are passionate about serving this city, passionate about serving the Mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=137)|
| 0:02:22| and also passionate about serving this Council, and it's been a pleasure and an honor for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=142)|
| 0:02:25| me to work with them and be leading this team of outstanding professionals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=145)|
| 0:02:29| The City of Knoxville is a service organization, that's why we're all here to service the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=149)|
| 0:02:34| We're also here to determine what the best strategic investments are that we can make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=154)|
| 0:02:39| not only to protect the current assets we have, and to improve and enhance our quality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=159)|
| 0:02:43| of life, but also to motivate public and private sector investment as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=163)|
| 0:02:49| As we've discussed before, investors invest their dollars where there's activity, where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=169)|
| 0:02:53| there's interest, where there is a nice environment and it's attractive, where they can sell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=173)|
| 0:02:59| where they can rent, and where they feel that their investment is secure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=179)|
| 0:03:03| And that security comes from knowing that there are public dollars that are also being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=183)|
| 0:03:06| invested and reinvested in infrastructure and development support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=186)|
| 0:03:11| Continued growth and improvement of a city requires a vision and a commitment to move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=191)|
| 0:03:15| forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=195)|
| 0:03:16| A budget attempts to capture that vision, and it establishes priorities and provides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=196)|
| 0:03:21| a mechanism for delivering on those priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=201)|
| 0:03:24| The City of Knoxville is in the midst of major new investments in the urban core, working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=204)|
| 0:03:27| to grow from the inside out, and I think we've all seen that that strategy has been very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=207)|
| 0:03:31| successful for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=211)|
| 0:03:33| The other things we've been working on on the operating side, of course, is improving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=213)|
| 0:03:37| the delivery of services, pursuing other funding opportunities whenever we possibly can, wherever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=217)|
| 0:03:42| they may be, and to get the absolute most from each tax dollar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=222)|
| 0:03:47| As the Chief Operating Officer, my focus has been to improve the level of service and to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=227)|
| 0:03:51| identify operating efficiencies wherever they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=231)|
| 0:03:54| And as a result of the hardworking staff, I'm very proud to tell you today that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=234)|
| 0:03:58| City of Knoxville beat its operating budget by $2,550,000 this last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=238)|
| 0:04:04| The fundamentals upon which the budget in front of you is based are the following.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=244)|
| 0:04:08| No spending of a fund balance on recurring expenses, continuing to maintain tight control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=248)|
| 0:04:14| over operating expenses, and maximizing capital investment by working with our public and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=254)|
| 0:04:20| private partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=260)|
| 0:04:21| So I'm going to turn it over to Jim York, who's going to give us some additional introductory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=261)|
| 0:04:24| budget information before we begin reviewing the budget details with our directors and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=264)|
| 0:04:29| managers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=269)|
| 0:04:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=270)|
| 0:04:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=271)|
| 0:04:32| I'm going to talk about a lot of the things that were covered in the Executive Summary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=272)|
| 0:04:41| and some of the other things that were prepared in your budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=281)|
| 0:04:45| But I'm going to, you know, if you think of that as kind of a broad brush, I'm going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=285)|
| 0:04:50| start getting down into some very specific items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=290)|
| 0:04:54| And hopefully I can answer all your questions as we talk about this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=294)|
| 0:05:01| The first thing, and probably most importantly, is that this budget has no tax rate increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=301)|
| 0:05:09| I would also point out that, you know, if we compare ourselves in terms of tax rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=309)|
| 0:05:14| where we were 10 years ago, our nominal rate and real rate at that time was about $2.81| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=314)|
| 0:05:24| per $100 valuation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=324)|
| 0:05:28| For this year, we're going to be proposing, again, the same tax rate, which is a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=328)|
| 0:05:32| less than $2.73 per 100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=332)|
| 0:05:37| So you see we have a drop in the nominal rate, but if you talk about the drop in the effective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=337)|
| 0:05:42| rate, which is really when you adjust for inflation, our effective rate this year compared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=342)|
| 0:05:49| to 10 years ago is $2.31.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=349)|
| 0:05:52| So there's about a 40 cent difference in terms of the nominal rate and the effective rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=352)|
| 0:05:58| when you adjust for inflation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=358)|
| 0:06:00| So to me, that's a significant thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=360)|
| 0:06:03| It shows that we've been managing well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=363)|
| 0:06:09| We've kind of lived within our means and we've been making the appropriate adjustments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=369)|
| 0:06:14| when you account for inflation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=374)|
| 0:06:19| There are three numbers that you probably ought to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=379)|
| 0:06:24| One of them I'm going to tell you to disregard after I mention it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=384)|
| 0:06:28| But the first one is the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=388)|
| 0:06:31| We spend a lot of time on the general fund because it is the main fund of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=391)|
| 0:06:37| It's the one where we cover basically 100% of fire, most of police, most of service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=397)|
| 0:06:43| almost everything touches the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=403)|
| 0:06:47| Now, there are a few other things, but we'll kind of describe those too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=407)|
| 0:06:52| The general fund for next year as proposed is around $206.4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=412)|
| 0:06:59| That's up about $5.87 million from a year ago, or about a little less than 3%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=419)|
| 0:07:08| The net budget, which includes those funds that are outside of the general fund, if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=428)|
| 0:07:15| add those in, you get to about $289.6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=435)|
| 0:07:37| That's up a little over $4 million, or about 1%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=457)|
| 0:07:42| Now, the total budget includes a lot of things that are double counted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=462)|
| 0:07:45| and that's why you can just don't pay any attention to that because that's more of an accounting procedure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=465)|
| 0:07:51| rather than what we're really spending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=471)|
| 0:07:54| And the net budget is more about what we propose to spend of the upcoming year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=474)|
| 0:08:00| There are a couple of things that basically drive this budget, some recurring themes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=480)|
| 0:08:09| I've talked about it at the retreat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=489)|
| 0:08:10| I'm going to talk to you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=490)|
| 0:08:13| And that is we've continued to see modest growth in our property values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=493)|
| 0:08:20| Our property tax, total property tax, not including delinquent taxes, are about $96.7 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=500)|
| 0:08:29| And you could actually write that number down because that, I'm going to make a comparison here in a few minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=509)|
| 0:08:37| That's up about $2 million from a year ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=517)|
| 0:08:42| Our real property, though, which is the biggest portion of that, and that's about $85.5 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=522)|
| 0:08:48| is only up about 1.47%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=528)|
| 0:08:53| And when you get down into more specifics, to me these are some significant numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=533)|
| 0:08:59| is we're forecasting residential growth at just over one-tenth of 1% for next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=539)|
| 0:09:08| We are seeing growth, and again, this is sort of like how I feel about interest rates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=548)|
| 0:09:14| but commercial growth worth about 2.9%, a little less than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=554)|
| 0:09:22| And that's not real high, but compared to residential growth, that's gigantic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=562)|
| 0:09:27| Industrial property at about a little less than seven-tenths of 1%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=567)|
| 0:09:32| So, our largest single revenue source to the general fund is growing, again, at a little less than 2% per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=572)|
| 0:09:46| And that's our largest revenue source to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=586)|
| 0:09:50| And it's only up about 1.7%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=590)|
| 0:09:54| Now, personal is growing, we think, at about .65.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=594)|
| 0:09:59| Public utility, we're actually forecasting it to go down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=599)|
| 0:10:03| and that's primarily as a result of a change in equalization rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=603)|
| 0:10:09| The state equalizes property like every two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=609)|
| 0:10:14| and they drop the equalization rate from 100% to roughly 96%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=614)|
| 0:10:19| So, that's one of the reasons we're thinking that there's going to be a drop in public utility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=619)|
| 0:10:24| Now, we had some good things that are happening, too, on the revenue side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=624)|
| 0:10:29| KEB, we're thinking it's going to be up about 1.2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=629)|
| 0:10:36| Local sales tax, we're having a good year this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=636)|
| 0:10:40| We're going to, we think, we're pretty confident we're going to end the year above where we budgeted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=640)|
| 0:10:45| and we're forecasting an additional growth of about 2.5% on top of that forecast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=645)|
| 0:10:52| So, that would put us at, again, roughly 36 point, or excuse me, $37.8 million next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=652)|
| 0:11:01| That's about 1.7 million more than what we have budgeted this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=661)|
| 0:11:06| And, again, these are all general fund numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=666)|
| 0:11:11| State sales tax, again, similar, maybe not as much growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=671)|
| 0:11:15| but we think it's going to be up about $772,000 for next year when compared to this year's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=675)|
| 0:11:26| Excise tax is almost double, is actually more than doubled from a year ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=686)|
| 0:11:30| It's up about $250,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=690)|
| 0:11:34| Hall income tax, I still don't know what hall income tax is going to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=694)|
| 0:11:37| so we've still plugged it at about 4.9 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=697)|
| 0:11:42| The negative is business tax, and we think business tax is actually going to be down this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=702)|
| 0:11:47| and we've continued to, we think it will probably hold steady next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=707)|
| 0:11:51| But, again, that appears to be the weak number here, and we think there are some reasons for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=711)|
| 0:12:00| And that's down about $756,000 when compared to last year's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=720)|
| 0:12:07| One thing, this is not a big number, but it's significant in that it reverses the trend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=727)|
| 0:12:12| and that's excess city court costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=732)|
| 0:12:15| We have seen city court revenues pick up a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=735)|
| 0:12:21| They've been on a downward trend for about the last three to four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=741)|
| 0:12:25| We think that they're actually going to hold steady probably for this year and maybe up a little bit next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=745)|
| 0:12:31| So we're only forecasting like a growth of $22,000, which is not a large number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=751)|
| 0:12:38| but just the significant fact that we kind of are holding steady and kind of reversing that trend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=758)|
| 0:12:44| I think is meaningful that we're not seeing the kind of drops we've had in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=764)|
| 0:12:54| Now, on the expenditure side, and again, the big expenditure driver is salary and benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=774)|
| 0:13:04| Our total salary and benefits, and this is citywide, not general fund, for next year are roughly $141.4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=784)|
| 0:13:14| That's up about $6.4 million over the budget for this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=794)|
| 0:13:21| And, again, remember I told you that our largest revenue source grew by about $2 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=801)|
| 0:13:26| and our expenses are growing by about $6.4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=806)|
| 0:13:31| So, to me, that's the big area of, again, if we go forward, we've got to somehow either shrink that gap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=811)|
| 0:13:39| or increase our revenues on the property tax side, and I know some of our folks are going to talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=819)|
| 0:13:45| some of the things that we're doing to try and do the latter, you know, as we go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=825)|
| 0:13:55| Now, I'm going to get into some real specifics on what those are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=835)|
| 0:13:59| The largest salaries itself, if we include everything citywide, we're up about $2.8 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=839)|
| 0:14:09| That's about 3.36 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=849)|
| 0:14:12| The largest growth happens to be in uniformed fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=852)|
| 0:14:16| That was kind of expected when we did the salary survey and some adjustments there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=856)|
| 0:14:22| We did the greatest adjustments in fire, and so that's why that's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=862)|
| 0:14:28| Fire's up over about $1.1 million when compared to a year ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=868)|
| 0:14:34| Police, the combined for police and fire, I mean, excuse me, police and general government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=874)|
| 0:14:40| is about the same level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=880)|
| 0:14:42| It's actually a little less than what it is in fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=882)|
| 0:14:46| So, you know, overall we're seeing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=886)|
| 0:14:48| Cat, if you include cat, we're probably up another $480,000 compared to last year's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=888)|
| 0:14:58| The pension, and I'm talking city, pension for city only, is up about $1.4 million to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=898)|
| 0:15:08| roughly $24.8 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=908)|
| 0:15:11| That's a lot of money, but compared to where we were forecasting a couple of years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=911)|
| 0:15:17| two years ago we were forecasting that we would be around $26 for 2015-16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=917)|
| 0:15:23| So our new estimates are down about $1.2 million from where we thought we were a couple years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=923)|
| 0:15:30| We've seen some significant growth in our investments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=930)|
| 0:15:35| The last two years we've had really good returns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=935)|
| 0:15:40| This year, at least currently, we're not anywhere close to where we were the last two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=940)|
| 0:15:46| and we've still got about a month and a half to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=946)|
| 0:15:51| And as we've seen, markets can change dramatically in a month and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=951)|
| 0:15:57| But again, so pensions are doing well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=957)|
| 0:16:03| They're still up, and they're still going to continue to increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=963)|
| 0:16:07| Right now we'll probably forecast that they're going to continue to increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=967)|
| 0:16:11| probably until 18-19 or 19-20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=971)|
| 0:16:17| Those are fiscal years, so we're talking three to four years out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=977)|
| 0:16:22| We'll continue to expect some increase in pension contributions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=982)|
| 0:16:27| and then probably level off for a while after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=987)|
| 0:16:31| We've still got about 24 years to go before they start to drop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=991)|
| 0:16:36| I'm not going to be here 24 years from here, and I'm not sure how many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=996)|
| 0:16:41| I don't think anybody's going to be on Council 24 years from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1001)|
| 0:16:46| We're still looking at growth there for the next few years, leveling off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1006)|
| 0:16:51| and then finally, if all numbers work correctly, then that will continue to decline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1011)|
| 0:16:59| In terms of benefits, again, we have some benefits that just rise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1019)|
| 0:17:04| and that doesn't matter, of course, because salaries go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1024)|
| 0:17:06| That would be FICA, Social Security, Medicare, our holiday pay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1026)|
| 0:17:12| our educational incentive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1032)|
| 0:17:14| All those go up when salaries go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1034)|
| 0:17:16| They're kind of tied to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1036)|
| 0:17:19| Health care is really not tied to salaries, but we're seeing, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1039)|
| 0:17:27| increases in health care costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1047)|
| 0:17:31| Health care costs next year are going to be around $13.4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1051)|
| 0:17:37| That's up about $1.4 million from a year ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1057)|
| 0:17:44| We're still doing well compared to national trends,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1064)|
| 0:17:48| and I know Christine Fitzgerald is going to be here later this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1068)|
| 0:17:54| She can talk about some of the things we're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1074)|
| 0:17:56| to try and at least hold down our costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1076)|
| 0:18:02| One of the things that we do do is we compare ourselves to our peers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1082)|
| 0:18:05| and I know that some of the things that we do have managed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1085)|
| 0:18:10| we've been much better at controlling our costs than some of our peers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1090)|
| 0:18:15| because of some things that they've done in terms of specialty drugs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1095)|
| 0:18:21| and compounding drugs that have added significantly to their costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1101)|
| 0:18:25| and we've done a lot of things in terms of control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1105)|
| 0:18:29| to hold down our costs in those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1109)|
| 0:18:31| Those are, again, dramatically increasing the cost of health care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1111)|
| 0:18:42| The one thing that, again, is a big benefit, and everybody's seen it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1122)|
| 0:18:48| and that's the cost of fuel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1128)|
| 0:18:51| A year ago, fuel costs were, I think, in terms of what it costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1131)|
| 0:18:57| for a barrel of oil was probably around $114.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1137)|
| 0:19:02| Two days ago, it was at $66 a barrel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1142)|
| 0:19:08| For us, that does translate into significant cost or savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1148)|
| 0:19:15| This year, we think fuel costs, again, are going to go down about $1.74 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1155)|
| 0:19:22| That's almost a 27% drop, and that seems to be the significant cost savings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1162)|
| 0:19:30| that we're seeing in terms of the budget for this upcoming year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1170)|
| 0:19:35| The other thing is we've managed to control our risk, our workers' compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1175)|
| 0:19:41| I'll say that our risk management folks have done significant steps there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1181)|
| 0:19:49| and we're seeing some reductions there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1189)|
| 0:19:53| You can see that across the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1193)|
| 0:19:55| You can see it in CAT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1195)|
| 0:19:57| For example, we took over the insurance for CAT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1197)|
| 0:20:03| We're now self-insured in terms of CAT for liability and workers' comp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1203)|
| 0:20:10| Next year, we think we're going to drop our cost about $300,000 just for CAT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1210)|
| 0:20:16| That is, again, the kinds of savings that we look for as we try and manage our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1216)|
| 0:20:30| Before I get into some of the other funds, I want to see if anybody has any questions here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1230)|
| 0:20:36| I'm going to talk about some of the other funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1236)|
| 0:20:39| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1239)|
| 0:20:41| Jim, you said that our biggest single expenditure, of course, is salary and benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1241)|
| 0:20:47| We're a service organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1247)|
| 0:20:48| It's people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1248)|
| 0:20:49| You mentioned a couple of areas of savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1249)|
| 0:20:52| Was there any other items being looked at to save?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1252)|
| 0:20:55| I mean, that's the big slice of the pie out of $141 million out of $206 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1255)|
| 0:21:01| Is there anything else we can be doing that cuts that cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1261)|
| 0:21:07| Obviously, if we go down and shave some small thing, it isn't going to help near as much as in this area of the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1267)|
| 0:21:14| Well, I mean, I think if you look at where we are in terms of staffing and personnel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1274)|
| 0:21:20| again, we've held relatively constant for a long period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1280)|
| 0:21:27| We're up two on the city side for next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1287)|
| 0:21:35| That's one person as a parking meter technician and one person in policy as a project manager position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1295)|
| 0:21:46| Now, CAT's up, again, because of some things that we're doing in terms of CAT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1306)|
| 0:21:51| in terms of expanding the first year of their five-year expansion plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1311)|
| 0:21:54| and that's going to add, I think, about five positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1314)|
| 0:21:57| But that's on the CAT side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1317)|
| 0:22:00| We've done pretty well in terms of holding our staffing levels constant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1320)|
| 0:22:06| We've talked about this, I think, internally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1326)|
| 0:22:12| Most of our workforce probably looks about my age, rather than the 20-somethings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1332)|
| 0:22:20| Fairly young, then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1340)|
| 0:22:21| Yeah, fairly young.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1341)|
| 0:22:24| But if we look, we see that we're going to have some significant turnover in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1344)|
| 0:22:29| All our departments, I think, are looking at ways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1349)|
| 0:22:34| as we come across that mass migration or mass exodus of the baby boom generation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1354)|
| 0:22:44| that we are going to look at how we do things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1364)|
| 0:22:49| We're reorganizing some departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1369)|
| 0:22:52| We've seen that in the service department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1372)|
| 0:22:55| They've done a very good job of reorganizing to hold down their costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1375)|
| 0:23:00| We're going to talk about some capital investments here later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1380)|
| 0:23:05| where we're trying to do things more efficiently by investing in certain capital items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1385)|
| 0:23:12| And hopefully some of those will help us in terms of staffing and so forth as we go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1392)|
| 0:23:20| Specifically, there are two items that struck me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1400)|
| 0:23:22| One is, there's at least about $2 million worth of overtime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1402)|
| 0:23:25| Now, a big piece of it is patrol officer overtime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1405)|
| 0:23:28| I don't know whether that's paid by the state or something else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1408)|
| 0:23:31| but that seemed like a large number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1411)|
| 0:23:33| Now, maybe that's a lot cheaper than hiring staff with all the benefit packages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1413)|
| 0:23:37| but can you comment on the overtime?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1417)|
| 0:23:40| One of the things that we look at, we always look at overtime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1420)|
| 0:23:45| We're always looking to make sure that overtime is cheaper than adding personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1425)|
| 0:23:53| Because if you start adding people, if you really think about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1433)|
| 0:23:57| you're loading your cost at probably about 1.4 times the salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1437)|
| 0:24:03| So if you added somebody at $50,000, it's probably going to cost you closer to $70,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1443)|
| 0:24:10| Because of the benefits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1450)|
| 0:24:11| Because of the benefits and all the other things that you're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1451)|
| 0:24:17| So you're always looking at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1457)|
| 0:24:19| Now, in terms of police, a lot of that overtime is actually paid for by grants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1459)|
| 0:24:26| or KCDC or something like that, or other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1466)|
| 0:24:30| So that's the big portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1470)|
| 0:24:33| In fire, you have what we call, it's just the way the schedules work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1473)|
| 0:24:39| to comply with the Fair Labor Standards Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1479)|
| 0:24:42| Because of their schedule, they're going to get what we call overtime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1482)|
| 0:24:48| because their schedule is normally either 216 hours or 240 hours in a cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1488)|
| 0:24:56| And anything over 212 hours by labor standards is mandatory overtime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1496)|
| 0:25:07| So just the way their schedule works, they're going to capture some overtime there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1507)|
| 0:25:13| Now, the other overtime, again, that's the kind of things that I don't think you can necessarily prepare for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1513)|
| 0:25:21| If we have bad weather, if we have events like service guys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1521)|
| 0:25:27| we have storms, we're going to put people out and they're going to work overtime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1527)|
| 0:25:33| But again, we are consistently looking at ways to control overtime costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1533)|
| 0:25:41| If we see where we think there's abuse, we will go out and try and address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1541)|
| 0:25:46| So that's just something that we look at in our normal course of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1546)|
| 0:25:52| The second part of the question was salaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1552)|
| 0:25:55| Was there any look at possibly holding those to a cost of living standard different than the 2.5%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1555)|
| 0:26:01| Well, I mean, and again, I'm going to put my 2 cents worth in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1561)|
| 0:26:07| and just take it because that's probably what it's worth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1567)|
| 0:26:10| But if we look at our salaries overtime, the 2.5% salaries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1570)|
| 0:26:20| if we take that since that was initiated back in the early 80s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1580)|
| 0:26:24| and if you just adjust for inflation, that's over the last 30 plus years, it's about 2.5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1584)|
| 0:26:34| We have seen and we saw this as a result of the salary survey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1594)|
| 0:26:38| and one of the things that, you know, we came to, I guess, back in February| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1598)|
| 0:26:41| and that seems like a long time ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1601)|
| 0:26:43| But as a result of the salary survey and the study that was done by Siegel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1603)|
| 0:26:52| we saw that we had to increase certain salary levels to be competitive in the overall marketplace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1612)|
| 0:26:59| And we did that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1619)|
| 0:27:00| And we did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1620)|
| 0:27:01| And I think, you know, Vicki Hatfield will be here today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1621)|
| 0:27:07| and I think she'll tell you the same thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1627)|
| 0:27:09| is the 2.5% probably keeps us about where we should be in terms of salaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1629)|
| 0:27:17| Now, again, finance people hate to see salaries go up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1637)|
| 0:27:21| just like, you know, because we hate to see anything go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1641)|
| 0:27:24| But if you look at it from our pricing, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1644)|
| 0:27:29| rewarding our employees in terms of market dynamics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1649)|
| 0:27:32| we're probably very close to what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1652)|
| 0:27:35| And that 2.5%, you know, kind of keeps us on track there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1655)|
| 0:27:41| And again, she can address it much better than I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1661)|
| 0:27:45| I just asked those because that was the big target.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1665)|
| 0:27:47| You mentioned that was where the bulk of the money is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1667)|
| 0:27:49| Those are the things that stood out to me at least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1669)|
| 0:27:52| That is where the big bulk of the money is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1672)|
| 0:27:54| And that's, you know, it's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1674)|
| 0:27:58| We have to focus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1678)|
| 0:27:59| I mean, we can focus on the little small things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1679)|
| 0:28:02| but we have to focus on, you know, staffing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1682)|
| 0:28:06| We have to focus on efficiency and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1686)|
| 0:28:10| Because, again, we see where our revenues are going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1690)|
| 0:28:12| and we see where our expenditures are going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1692)|
| 0:28:14| and we have to, you know, any budget is a job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1694)|
| 0:28:18| balancing those two, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1698)|
| 0:28:21| Chris, do you have anything to add to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1701)|
| 0:28:24| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1704)|
| 0:28:25| I mean, one of the things, I think Jim mentioned this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1705)|
| 0:28:27| and we talked about this in the budget hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1707)|
| 0:28:29| I know Councilwoman Palmer was there and others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1709)|
| 0:28:32| But we really are, from the operations side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1712)|
| 0:28:34| looking at every time we have a retirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1714)|
| 0:28:37| looking at that department and seeing what that individual did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1717)|
| 0:28:40| what those job responsibilities are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1720)|
| 0:28:43| Sometimes the job needs to be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1723)|
| 0:28:46| Sometimes it doesn't really exist anymore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1726)|
| 0:28:48| because of technological advances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1728)|
| 0:28:49| because of how we change or how we contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1729)|
| 0:28:51| with other organizations to do certain portions of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1731)|
| 0:28:54| But we're looking at it closely and we have seen...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1734)|
| 0:28:57| I think those are opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1737)|
| 0:28:59| Those are all opportunities for us to, first of all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1739)|
| 0:29:01| to look at the organization, see how we're operating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1741)|
| 0:29:03| and how we can operate the most efficiently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1743)|
| 0:29:05| And then also just to see, does this make sense anymore?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1745)|
| 0:29:09| We've even taken a couple of positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1749)|
| 0:29:11| where we've had two retirements and really combined the position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1751)|
| 0:29:14| and come back with one position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1754)|
| 0:29:16| or changed the job responsibilities in some fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1756)|
| 0:29:19| But every time that's happened, and Jim pointed it out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1759)|
| 0:29:21| every time that's happened, we really take a long look at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1761)|
| 0:29:23| and see, you know, where are the holes now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1763)|
| 0:29:26| You know, maybe this was the right position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1766)|
| 0:29:28| when this person was in here, but things have changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1768)|
| 0:29:30| Are there holes somewhere else over here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1770)|
| 0:29:32| that we can fill in a different way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1772)|
| 0:29:34| But we talk about it a lot in our staff meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1774)|
| 0:29:36| They'll all tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1776)|
| 0:29:37| I think they're sitting back here, a lot of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1777)|
| 0:29:40| And we have made a lot of changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1780)|
| 0:29:41| Public service, we've been able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1781)|
| 0:29:43| Also in building permits and inspections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1783)|
| 0:29:45| one in every 1.7 people are eligible for retirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1785)|
| 0:29:48| so we're really taking a long look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1788)|
| 0:29:50| In addition to, of course, changing how we do work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1790)|
| 0:29:53| you guys may recall we've moved to multidiscipline inspectors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1793)|
| 0:29:56| for residential construction in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1796)|
| 0:29:58| That's created some additional opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1798)|
| 0:30:01| Sure, and you even have computers, I guess, that now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1801)|
| 0:30:03| log the ticket stuff for police officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1803)|
| 0:30:05| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1805)|
| 0:30:06| So they don't have to double enter and triple enter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1806)|
| 0:30:08| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1808)|
| 0:30:09| E-citations will help dramatically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1809)|
| 0:30:10| It will also help with city court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1810)|
| 0:30:12| which I'm really excited about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1812)|
| 0:30:15| But those are some ways that we'll be working on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1815)|
| 0:30:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1818)|
| 0:30:19| We're going to move along here to Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1819)|
| 0:30:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1821)|
| 0:30:22| I think you're right, Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1822)|
| 0:30:23| I think 2.5% probably equaled the market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1823)|
| 0:30:28| and I think you just held status quo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1828)|
| 0:30:30| You kept competitive in the marketplace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1830)|
| 0:30:32| Based on our company and based on a little bit of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1832)|
| 0:30:37| very informal research that we do, I'd say 2, 2.5%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1837)|
| 0:30:40| was probably the raise in the marketplace when I saw it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1840)|
| 0:30:44| Jim, you laid out some great changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1844)|
| 0:30:48| and maybe some surprises to the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1848)|
| 0:30:51| and increases in income,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1851)|
| 0:30:53| and you were able to take benefit of, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1853)|
| 0:30:56| really a bonus on the haul income tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1856)|
| 0:31:00| and then some reductions like on the gas savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1860)|
| 0:31:02| Would you say that the tax increase we did last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1862)|
| 0:31:06| was greater than it needed to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1866)|
| 0:31:08| Were there an extra surplus?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1868)|
| 0:31:11| You've added to your surplus in doing all that project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1871)|
| 0:31:15| Would you say that we overkilled on a 27% increase?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1875)|
| 0:31:20| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1880)|
| 0:31:23| Even with all those surpluses and with that income?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1883)|
| 0:31:26| Well, I mean, again, you look at just our cost increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1886)|
| 0:31:32| Where would we be had gas prices not fallen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1892)|
| 0:31:37| You know, like I said, we're estimating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1897)|
| 0:31:40| we're going to save about $1.7 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1900)|
| 0:31:43| And had you talked to me a year ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1903)|
| 0:31:46| and I'm not sure that anyone would have said gas prices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1906)|
| 0:31:51| would have dropped from, say, well over $110 a barrel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1911)|
| 0:31:56| to $50 a barrel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1916)|
| 0:31:58| I mean, that's just a significant change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1918)|
| 0:32:01| that I don't think anybody forecast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1921)|
| 0:32:06| But I think we can see it out of real estate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1926)|
| 0:32:08| I think we can see it coming out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1928)|
| 0:32:10| you know, that the real estate is coming back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1930)|
| 0:32:13| I was surprised at your projection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1933)|
| 0:32:14| one-tenth of 1% on residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1934)|
| 0:32:17| I'm guessing, I'm hoping it's going to be better than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1937)|
| 0:32:20| Well, I mean, I always hope it's better than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1940)|
| 0:32:22| I always hope it's better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1942)|
| 0:32:23| That seems very low to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1943)|
| 0:32:24| But I mean, I think based on what we've seen in the last 12 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1944)|
| 0:32:27| I mean, I think we are seeing that as a positive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1947)|
| 0:32:29| certainly in the next projection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1949)|
| 0:32:31| Well, I mean, we're seeing it, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1951)|
| 0:32:33| And, again, we are seeing it on the commercial side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1953)|
| 0:32:35| We are too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1955)|
| 0:32:36| And apartments, I don't consider apartments residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1956)|
| 0:32:39| I don't either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1959)|
| 0:32:40| No, I'm talking single family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1960)|
| 0:32:41| So I want to make that distinction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1961)|
| 0:32:43| This is single family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1963)|
| 0:32:44| Yeah, that's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1964)|
| 0:32:45| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1965)|
| 0:32:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1966)|
| 0:32:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1967)|
| 0:32:48| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1968)|
| 0:32:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1969)|
| 0:32:51| That cautionary growth figure you've used, I agree with George,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1971)|
| 0:32:56| that seems awfully low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1976)|
| 0:32:58| But there does seem to be one bright spot, or several bright spots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1978)|
| 0:33:02| and perhaps we will find that that is low in the long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1982)|
| 0:33:05| But the sales tax, that 37.8, whatever it is, that's the net.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1985)|
| 0:33:11| Because our actual sales tax revenue is far greater than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1991)|
| 0:33:15| But we devote, what, 72%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1995)|
| 0:33:17| So this is the 28% we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1997)|
| 0:33:19| This is the 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=1999)|
| 0:33:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2000)|
| 0:33:21| Again, if we look at, let's just talk countywide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2001)|
| 0:33:24| And I'm going to throw some numbers out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2004)|
| 0:33:27| Hopefully that will make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2007)|
| 0:33:29| If you take a look at the countywide, roughly, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2009)|
| 0:33:34| I want to say somewhere in the 73 to 74% of every sales tax dollar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2014)|
| 0:33:41| that is generated in Knox County is generated inside the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2021)|
| 0:33:47| Now, with inside the city, roughly 72% of all, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2027)|
| 0:33:53| each dollar that's generated inside the city goes to Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2033)|
| 0:34:00| Anything that's in unincorporated Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2040)|
| 0:34:04| 72% of that goes to Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2044)|
| 0:34:07| And then in the township of Farragut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2047)|
| 0:34:10| 50% of every dollar that's generated there goes to Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2050)|
| 0:34:15| Now, again, we are seeing, you know, increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2055)|
| 0:34:20| To us, sales tax is the second largest countywide for the school district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2060)|
| 0:34:27| I'm thinking that sales tax may be the second largest on the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2067)|
| 0:34:33| maybe even greater than property tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2073)|
| 0:34:35| The largest, of course, for schools I know is state shared income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2075)|
| 0:34:42| And I think sales tax is the second largest source there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2082)|
| 0:34:46| And it's probably well over $100 million plus to the schools countywide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2086)|
| 0:34:53| and probably well over $100 million just from inside the city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2093)|
| 0:35:00| That's where I was going, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2100)|
| 0:35:03| You know, I'd just like to dovetail off Councilman Wallace's thoughts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2103)|
| 0:35:08| about the 2.5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2108)|
| 0:35:09| I mean, I think it would be irresponsible for us as well to have gotten where we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2109)|
| 0:35:14| with the salaries and the survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2114)|
| 0:35:16| I mean, we've gotten to where I think we want to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2116)|
| 0:35:19| And then to not consider that, then we start, you know, immediately following behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2119)|
| 0:35:24| So I think it's wise to keep going on at that rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2124)|
| 0:35:32| So I think it's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2132)|
| 0:35:34| Jim, anything else that you'd like to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2134)|
| 0:35:37| I mean, I want to talk about some other funds unless you're just totally bored with me, I can quit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2137)|
| 0:35:43| I'll be happy to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2143)|
| 0:35:44| I'm just letting you do your dog and pony show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2144)|
| 0:35:46| You don't want to take a vote on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2146)|
| 0:35:47| No, I'm kidding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2147)|
| 0:35:49| I'm open for a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2149)|
| 0:35:55| Just before I bounce up, if you don't mind, before I, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2155)|
| 0:36:01| if you could turn to page five, hopefully I'll have brought your book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2161)|
| 0:36:04| I'm just going to kind of highlight some funds and some things that I want to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2164)|
| 0:36:11| And that gives you basically the budget for every single fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2171)|
| 0:36:15| I'm not going to touch, you know, I could do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2175)|
| 0:36:18| but I'm not going to touch on every single fund that's right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2178)|
| 0:36:21| But there are a couple of ones that I want to talk about, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2181)|
| 0:36:25| because there's some issues or some positives as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2185)|
| 0:36:31| The first one is State Street Aid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2191)|
| 0:36:34| That's Fund 201.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2194)|
| 0:36:38| We're actually forecasting, and again, this is a bit of a surprise to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2198)|
| 0:36:44| that we're forecasting gas taxes to be up next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2204)|
| 0:36:49| And that's, trust me, that's all gas taxes, about $80,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2209)|
| 0:36:58| The state is, you know, they're seeing it on the statewide level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2218)|
| 0:37:03| They're attributing it to lower gas prices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2223)|
| 0:37:06| Again, people are getting used to close to $2 a gallon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2226)|
| 0:37:10| I'm not sure where they stand when it's now $2.50 a gallon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2230)|
| 0:37:14| so that may change going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2234)|
| 0:37:19| So we are seeing some increases in gas taxes, and we're forecasting that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2239)|
| 0:37:25| I would note that right now almost all of that money goes to street lighting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2245)|
| 0:37:32| and street lighting is unfortunately going up by about $186,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2252)|
| 0:37:39| So we're actually cutting into what we would use for bridge maintenance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2259)|
| 0:37:44| and some of our traffic signals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2264)|
| 0:37:48| We're having to shift some funds around to keep those whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2268)|
| 0:37:52| I don't know whether our sustainability folks are here yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2272)|
| 0:37:57| We are working on some things in terms of trying to reduce our street lighting costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2277)|
| 0:38:04| or, you know, at least stop the growth in expenses there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2284)|
| 0:38:11| I will say that we're still having some trouble making the numbers work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2291)|
| 0:38:14| but we are continuing to work on that to see what we can refine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2294)|
| 0:38:18| and see if we can at least halt that growth going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2298)|
| 0:38:22| And, again, if Erin is here, then I know she can maybe talk about that, you know, here in a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2302)|
| 0:38:31| City court, again, just to kind of reiterate, we are seeing some improvement in city court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2311)|
| 0:38:36| We see that in the excess revenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2316)|
| 0:38:42| They're actually up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2322)|
| 0:38:44| City inspections, and we're seeing, again, positive returns on our building inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2324)|
| 0:38:53| We're seeing those go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2333)|
| 0:38:54| Again, not dramatically, but we are up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2334)|
| 0:38:57| Again, I want to reiterate what Christy said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2337)|
| 0:39:00| I think Peter Aaron is doing an excellent job in terms of reorganizing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2340)|
| 0:39:05| and trying to hold down costs there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2345)|
| 0:39:11| If you look at it from where fees cover in terms of costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2351)|
| 0:39:17| we're a little over two-thirds of the building permit fees cover, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2357)|
| 0:39:23| cover about a little over two-thirds of the total cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2363)|
| 0:39:27| That is up from where it was a few years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2367)|
| 0:39:30| and we may be trying to come up with some things to even increase that percentage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2370)|
| 0:39:36| of how much building permits, you know, cover in terms of cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2376)|
| 0:39:44| I'm going to hit debt service, but since I need to flip pages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2384)|
| 0:39:48| I'm going to wait a few minutes, and I want to talk to you about debt service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2388)|
| 0:39:53| I want to point out, again, and this is if you talk about Convince and Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2393)|
| 0:39:58| and Convince and Center is probably one of our more complicated funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2398)|
| 0:40:02| because it includes so many things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2402)|
| 0:40:04| but I want to talk about some of the things that we're seeing there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2404)|
| 0:40:07| and I think this is very positive in terms of hotel-motel tax numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2407)|
| 0:40:13| We are seeing those are up both on the city side and county-wide side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2413)|
| 0:40:23| The amount of money that we'll be going to visit Knoxville next year is up about $143,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2423)|
| 0:40:33| $143,600 next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2433)|
| 0:40:39| That is totally due to the increase that we're seeing in hotel-motel tax numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2439)|
| 0:40:46| Now, again, that's due to probably lots of different things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2446)|
| 0:40:51| but ranging from probably a new football coach, a better football record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2451)|
| 0:40:57| to the improvement in the economy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2457)|
| 0:41:00| but also to the work of our Convince and Center and to visit Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2460)|
| 0:41:06| and, again, we're seeing that reflected in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2466)|
| 0:41:10| Another thing that is included in the Convince and Center fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2470)|
| 0:41:13| and that's $30,000 going to the Film Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2473)|
| 0:41:18| and hopefully that will also spur some investment if we can lure some filmmakers here or whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2478)|
| 0:41:27| and, you know, improve the economy and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2487)|
| 0:41:34| Of note, and, again, one of the things that's included here in the Convince and Center is we've included $700,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2494)|
| 0:41:46| and basically that is to replace the carpet in the concourses and, you know, a couple of other rooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2506)|
| 0:41:58| I would point out that there's a long lead time on carpet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2518)|
| 0:42:03| You know, we think it's about a two-year lead time, but we're now prepared for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2523)|
| 0:42:08| Another thing that we're doing is we're beginning to, as the center actually gets some age on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2528)|
| 0:42:15| we're starting to see, you know, the kinds of things that always happen to any building where you have to make a improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2535)|
| 0:42:23| We're setting aside some stuff in a reserve to try and anticipate those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2543)|
| 0:42:29| We've seen already done a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2549)|
| 0:42:31| We did some boiler improvements, and we did something else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2551)|
| 0:42:35| and, again, that escaped me at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2555)|
| 0:42:40| And then you've also seen some things that we've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2560)|
| 0:42:44| We have fixed the salmon run, and we have fixed the outside walkway, the terrace, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2564)|
| 0:42:52| And so we've done a lot of improvements there, and hopefully that's going to translate into improved bookings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2572)|
| 0:42:59| Again, we want to keep the facility up to date and modern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2579)|
| 0:43:03| And, again, I want to point out, because I think those are very positive signs that we're seeing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2583)|
| 0:43:08| and I think both the convention center and Visit Knoxville are doing an excellent job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2588)|
| 0:43:14| and I think they both will be here this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2594)|
| 0:43:18| And, again, you can probably ask any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2598)|
| 0:43:24| Again, I talked a little bit about risk management, and if you go down to the internal service funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2604)|
| 0:43:32| fleet service, that's fuel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2612)|
| 0:43:36| That reduction there is basically all in fuel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2616)|
| 0:43:40| Risk management, again, I want to compliment our folks for doing good work in terms of preventing injuries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2620)|
| 0:43:49| and also preventing some of our liability claims that we're seeing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2629)|
| 0:43:58| Mass transit, again, it is up, but we've managed to do a few things without significantly increasing the city's contributions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2638)|
| 0:44:09| And, again, they benefit from fuel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2649)|
| 0:44:12| There's not quite as much as the city, but, again, if you think about it, it's about, for every penny change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2652)|
| 0:44:20| it's about an $8,000 difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2660)|
| 0:44:23| So we're seeing that in fuel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2663)|
| 0:44:25| And, again, as I mentioned earlier, we're seeing about $300,000 in just insurance savings from us taking over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2665)|
| 0:44:33| And, basically, I want to compliment their safety folks for that as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2673)|
| 0:44:38| because we're doing it from a self-insurance standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2678)|
| 0:44:45| but that relies on everybody else focusing on safety and focusing on liability claims.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2685)|
| 0:44:54| And, again, we've been very successful on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2694)|
| 0:44:57| And, again, Don Disler can probably answer much more specific questions later today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2697)|
| 0:45:04| In terms of debt service, and, again, I'm going to flip pages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2704)|
| 0:45:10| I'll stop for questions now before I hit debt service, unless somebody would like to have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2710)|
| 0:45:18| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2718)|
| 0:45:19| You mentioned, Jim, under general fund, your miscellaneous special revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2719)|
| 0:45:25| Could you touch on some of those items that that covers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2725)|
| 0:45:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2729)|
| 0:45:30| Fund 240?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2730)|
| 0:45:31| Yeah, I'll be happy to cover that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2731)|
| 0:45:33| Miscellaneous special revenue fund is just a bunch of little small things that we've kind of aggregated together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2733)|
| 0:45:41| And you're probably asking because that's down significantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2741)|
| 0:45:44| And, really, that's down because of some transfers to capital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2744)|
| 0:45:49| Included within that fund, we have some dedicated funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2749)|
| 0:45:54| There's a police training fund and a police capital projects fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2754)|
| 0:45:59| And we take money from that to fund capital projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2759)|
| 0:46:04| And the police training fund is actually down about $1.1 million in the transfers for police capital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2764)|
| 0:46:12| The police capital fund is down about $203,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2772)|
| 0:46:17| Another one that's in there, that includes Safety City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2777)|
| 0:46:20| And last year we had $450,000 going for capital improvements to Safety City, and those are not repeated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2780)|
| 0:46:29| The other things that are included in that fund, and, again, these are not all of them because there's a bunch of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2789)|
| 0:46:37| You've got money in there for historic preservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2797)|
| 0:46:45| We put $500,000 in there last year, and another $500,000 are going into that fund this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2805)|
| 0:46:53| We have the demolition by neglect, which had $100,000 last year, again has $100,000 going into it next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2813)|
| 0:47:02| You've got neighborhood small grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2822)|
| 0:47:05| That's actually, we're putting $30,000 into that fund from the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2825)|
| 0:47:12| But the total allocation for neighborhood small grants is $45,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2832)|
| 0:47:16| because we'll be drawing down some of the funds that have accumulated in that fund over the last couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2836)|
| 0:47:26| And, again, that's the bulk of the changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2846)|
| 0:47:30| That also includes the police drug funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2850)|
| 0:47:33| There are all kinds of changes in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2853)|
| 0:47:36| I would point out that we used to be getting a lot more money in terms of drug bust,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2856)|
| 0:47:44| and that's tended to have dropped off in the recent years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2864)|
| 0:47:49| It may start peaking up here again, but, in a way, that's kind of a good sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2869)|
| 0:47:56| If you can control the drugs, I guess that's probably a good piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2876)|
| 0:48:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2882)|
| 0:48:03| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2883)|
| 0:48:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2884)|
| 0:48:06| The fuel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2886)|
| 0:48:07| I'm delighted that the cost is down, and I hope it remains so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2887)|
| 0:48:11| But it seems to me I recall in past years you talking about buying this on a contractual basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2891)|
| 0:48:16| so you lock in some price over whatever time, and I'm not sure what that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2896)|
| 0:48:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2902)|
| 0:48:23| We do not hedge fuel, if that's your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2903)|
| 0:48:27| What we do is we do have a contract with a supplier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2907)|
| 0:48:33| We pay a very small premium to ensure delivery, to make sure we're first in line if there's kind of a crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2913)|
| 0:48:43| If, for example, a hurricane, and we hope this never happens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2923)|
| 0:48:46| but if a hurricane were to hit New Orleans again and disrupt supplies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2926)|
| 0:48:50| then we want to make sure that we're at least top of the list in terms of getting our fuel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2930)|
| 0:48:55| But what we do in terms of pricing for fuel is we use, we have a contract that we buy on the open market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2935)|
| 0:49:04| and we're priced at Opus Plus, and Opus, I think, is the Oil Producers Index Series,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2944)|
| 0:49:11| but don't hold me to that, and we pay a little bit over that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2951)|
| 0:49:16| So we're, instead of buying on the spark market, we buy basically on that index.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2956)|
| 0:49:22| We, you know, one of the things we do look at, we've looked at it in the past, is hedging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2962)|
| 0:49:29| That's a lot more complicated, you know, transaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2969)|
| 0:49:37| The problem is, and I think we use a lot of fuel, so we use, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2977)|
| 0:49:43| at us in CAT, we're, you know, close to 2 million gallons of fuel a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2983)|
| 0:49:48| But when it comes to fuel hedging, that's a pretty small, you know, again, to me, that's a lot of fuel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2988)|
| 0:49:58| But when it comes to hedging, that's a pretty small, you know, amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=2998)|
| 0:50:04| And we would not want to, you know, even if we were to hedge, we would not hedge at 100%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3004)|
| 0:50:09| That's kind of a dangerous gamble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3009)|
| 0:50:14| But again, it's always something we look at to see if we can make the numbers work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3014)|
| 0:50:21| And, you know, last year had we been hedging, the market would have killed us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3021)|
| 0:50:26| If we were to hedge now, and the market goes back up to, you know, again, $110, $120,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3026)|
| 0:50:32| we'd be, you know, in like Flynn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3032)|
| 0:50:35| But, you know, so again, it's, again, but we, to actually do this right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3035)|
| 0:50:43| we would probably need to combine with the county and the schools and maybe a few others| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3043)|
| 0:50:48| just to get our volume up to make it worthwhile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3048)|
| 0:50:51| So hopefully that, you know, answers your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3051)|
| 0:50:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3055)|
| 0:50:59| Yeah, just one observation on the hotel-motel tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3059)|
| 0:51:05| It's a little concerning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3065)|
| 0:51:06| I don't think we can do anything about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3066)|
| 0:51:08| But when we're moving our football games to Nashville instead of here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3068)|
| 0:51:12| I don't know if we actually make those games.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3072)|
| 0:51:15| We still have the same, I think, seven is the number that we generally have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3075)|
| 0:51:18| But it's a little concerning to me to see that revenue going to Davidson County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3078)|
| 0:51:25| So just an observation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3085)|
| 0:51:27| Yeah, I mean, again, as long as we have seven, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3087)|
| 0:51:33| Well, my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3093)|
| 0:51:35| I hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3095)|
| 0:51:36| That's a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3096)|
| 0:51:37| That is a lot of money, and we know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3097)|
| 0:51:39| But, again, I don't think the growth in hotel-motel tax is entirely due to football.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3099)|
| 0:51:47| I think that's a portion of it, but, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3107)|
| 0:51:50| Well, I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3110)|
| 0:51:51| But, I mean, that's a huge revenue generator for our hospitality industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3111)|
| 0:51:55| I mean, the food service and the, you know, obviously the heads in beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3115)|
| 0:51:59| But I know there's not anything we can do about it, but it's just troubling to me for whatever that's worth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3119)|
| 0:52:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3129)|
| 0:52:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3130)|
| 0:52:11| Now I'm going to ask you to turn to page 44.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3131)|
| 0:52:16| I'm going to talk a little bit about debt service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3136)|
| 0:52:22| And page 44 shows you basically where our debt stands at the end of this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3142)|
| 0:52:32| what we'll pay down next year, and where we'll be at the end of next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3152)|
| 0:52:40| At the end of this year, we should have, again, in total about $181 million in debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3160)|
| 0:52:51| Most of that is related to the convention center, and that's $115 million, you know, for debt at the end of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3171)|
| 0:53:00| Next year we'll pay down about $10.675 million, which will leave us at around $170 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3180)|
| 0:53:10| That's assuming that we don't take on any more debt next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3190)|
| 0:53:16| When we compare ourselves to last year, we're actually down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3196)|
| 0:53:23| Our total debt service on not convention related is down about $500,000 from a year ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3203)|
| 0:53:33| That's related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3213)|
| 0:53:35| We were doing some estimates on those 2014 bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3215)|
| 0:53:39| The way they ended up structured was saving a little bit more on the front end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3219)|
| 0:53:43| and probably paying a little bit more on the back end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3223)|
| 0:53:46| But from an interest perspective, that's a very good deal, and that's where the bulk of that's coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3226)|
| 0:53:52| And again, as we continue to pay down debt, then the interest declines, and that's just the way it goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3232)|
| 0:54:01| Our total debt on the convention center is down about $300,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3241)|
| 0:54:06| and that's because the largest single issue there, you'll see it's around a little less than $60 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3246)|
| 0:54:13| That is a variable rate debt, and we are paying very low interest rates on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3253)|
| 0:54:21| We're actually paying it tomorrow, and I think we're about 64 basis points, which is about six-tenths of a percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3261)|
| 0:54:31| And I wish I could go to a bank and get those kind of rates, but that's a very low rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3271)|
| 0:54:36| and that's our largest single piece of debt on the convention center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3276)|
| 0:54:42| If the Fed raises the rate, does that go up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3282)|
| 0:54:45| If the Fed raises that rate, it depends on how it affects LIBOR, and it would probably push LIBOR up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3285)|
| 0:54:56| And if that were to happen, then obviously we'd pay more than 64 basis points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3296)|
| 0:55:00| but we're still paying a lot less than we would if we were to go fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3300)|
| 0:55:06| We're always looking at that possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3306)|
| 0:55:09| Right now, if you were to ask me if we were to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3309)|
| 0:55:12| we'd probably pay at least almost $900,000 more in interest if we were to go fixed rate and probably more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3312)|
| 0:55:22| So right now, it makes sense to continue to hold the variable rate numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3322)|
| 0:55:29| Again, even if it goes up, even if it doubled, you're still looking at 1.2 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3329)|
| 0:55:35| That's a really good rate, folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3335)|
| 0:55:40| The other question, and I think Council Member Dahlhopian mentioned this earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3340)|
| 0:55:44| so I'm going to try and answer it now, and he'd ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3344)|
| 0:55:49| and we look at it as paying down debt and also avoiding future debt in terms of issuing debt for capital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3349)|
| 0:55:58| We have money going from the Debt Service Fund to fund some of our capital projects next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3358)|
| 0:56:06| and we actually have about $1.17 million more going from the Debt Service for capital next year than we do in 2014-15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3366)|
| 0:56:17| But again, when you look at it as normally you issue debt for capital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3377)|
| 0:56:21| and if we can take that and avoid the issuance of debt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3381)|
| 0:56:25| then that's part of the things we look at in terms of our Debt Service Fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3385)|
| 0:56:31| I'll answer questions, and then I'm going to touch on one more thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3391)|
| 0:56:34| I missed something here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3394)|
| 0:56:35| So the debt that we, the latest bond debt that we incurred last year, is that the 38?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3395)|
| 0:56:43| That's the 31080.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3403)|
| 0:56:45| 31080.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3405)|
| 0:56:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3406)|
| 0:56:47| Third item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3407)|
| 0:56:48| Got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3408)|
| 0:56:49| Yeah, and it was actually a little bit more than that, so we paid down a little bit this year, but not much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3409)|
| 0:56:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3413)|
| 0:56:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3414)|
| 0:56:55| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3415)|
| 0:56:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3417)|
| 0:56:58| I want to touch on, again, I know I'm boring you to death,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3418)|
| 0:57:02| but I want to talk a little bit about capital and some of the things that we're doing in capital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3422)|
| 0:57:08| I'm not going to go over all the capital projects again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3428)|
| 0:57:13| but some things I want to talk about, and I think these are significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3433)|
| 0:57:18| They don't kind of get the high visibility of some of the things that we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3438)|
| 0:57:27| but they have a potentially significant impact on the way we do business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3447)|
| 0:57:31| and one of those, and again, don't ask me to explain all this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3451)|
| 0:57:35| but we are in the process of redoing our work order system and doing an AVL system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3455)|
| 0:57:44| which is basically automatic vehicle locator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3464)|
| 0:57:48| We have allocated $1.2 million for phase two of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3468)|
| 0:57:53| We think that's going to have a significant impact on the way we do business going forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3473)|
| 0:58:00| and that will make us more efficient, quite honestly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3480)|
| 0:58:06| Another thing, again, it's hard to say these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3486)|
| 0:58:09| but we've got money for an additional stormwater vacuum truck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3489)|
| 0:58:13| It's only about $240,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3493)|
| 0:58:17| But, again, in terms of cutting down our backlog, working more efficiently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3497)|
| 0:58:23| that is the kind of capital investment that we see having a good return on investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3503)|
| 0:58:31| Parking meter modernization, we've got very old parking meters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3511)|
| 0:58:37| and we've got $500,000 allocated for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3517)|
| 0:58:41| I already mentioned the $700,000 for the carpet replacement at the convention center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3521)|
| 0:58:51| This one is kind of ATMS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3531)|
| 0:58:54| We've talked more and more a lot about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3534)|
| 0:58:56| and that's that we're building up funds for that phase two of replacing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3536)|
| 0:59:01| basically updating our entire traffic signalization program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3541)|
| 0:59:08| We've all seen this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3548)|
| 0:59:10| Everything in daily life gets much more digital and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3550)|
| 0:59:14| and we're just way behind the times in terms of some of the things that we're doing there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3554)|
| 0:59:20| So that, I think, is going to have a significant impact on the way the city functions going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3560)|
| 0:59:28| An interesting one, and Chief Sharp can talk about this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3568)|
| 0:59:33| is we've allocated some money to buy, they're called mechanical CBR devices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3573)|
| 0:59:39| and basically what those are is they have a very high effective rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3579)|
| 0:59:44| If you can reach somebody in terms of doing CPR by an individual, you can use these devices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3584)|
| 0:59:52| They have a much better success rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3592)|
| 0:59:54| If you can get to somebody in time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3594)|
| 0:59:57| the success rate of saving those people using these devices is much, much higher than doing it by an individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3597)|
| 1:00:06| Again, the Chief can probably address that, but I think that's significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3606)|
| 1:00:09| That's a benefit to the citizens of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3609)|
| 1:00:15| A couple of other things, again, some of these may have been touched on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3615)|
| 1:00:19| We've got money in there to finish Merchants Clinton Highway intersections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3619)|
| 1:00:26| We have money, additional money, a million dollars for Greenway Corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3626)|
| 1:00:31| We had a million dollars, so we're now up to, we'll be up to two million dollars for Greenway Corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3631)|
| 1:00:38| Again, I think that's an emphasis of council, and I think that's something there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3638)|
| 1:00:44| We've got $75,000 to finish some improvements to Fort Dickerson Park, the quarry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3644)|
| 1:00:54| And one other item that I just want to mention is we've got $1.1 million to do sidewalks along Old Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3654)|
| 1:01:07| Again, that's not all of our capital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3667)|
| 1:01:10| Some of the things that we do is we're constantly trying to maintain our assets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3670)|
| 1:01:17| That's what good businesses do, and so we see that in our street paving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3677)|
| 1:01:21| We've got $5.8 million in city funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3681)|
| 1:01:27| and we anticipate maybe another million dollars from KUV to pave places where they've torn up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3687)|
| 1:01:36| and maybe they'll get Walnut Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3696)|
| 1:01:42| And we've got that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3702)|
| 1:01:43| We've got money in for maintenance of our fire stations, upkeeping those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3703)|
| 1:01:50| We have money for HVAC and roof replacements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3710)|
| 1:01:53| Again, those are big-ticket items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3713)|
| 1:01:54| But again, preservation of your assets is a significant thing that businesses do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3714)|
| 1:02:02| and we want to do the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3722)|
| 1:02:07| That's it for capital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3727)|
| 1:02:08| I'll answer any questions that you might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3728)|
| 1:02:11| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3731)|
| 1:02:12| Jim, I'm wondering why there's nothing, or I don't see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3732)|
| 1:02:16| Maybe I'm not seeing any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3736)|
| 1:02:19| There's no mention of the potential purchase of the State Supreme Court building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3739)|
| 1:02:24| Again, I may not be the best person, but we'll be coming back to you probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3744)|
| 1:02:31| I'm not sure what date the first council meeting is in June with a budget amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3751)|
| 1:02:37| In that, we'll have probably a couple things on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3757)|
| 1:02:42| We'll have money for the purchase of the State Supreme Court site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3762)|
| 1:02:48| Why would that be in an amendment when we've got it right here in front of us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3768)|
| 1:02:51| Why wouldn't we include it in what we're looking at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3771)|
| 1:02:53| We're taking it out of this year's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3773)|
| 1:02:56| We're hoping to get it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3776)|
| 1:02:59| It was one of those things that came up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3779)|
| 1:03:01| and we just thought it would probably be better to take it out of this year's allocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3781)|
| 1:03:06| Would that come out of reserves then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3786)|
| 1:03:09| Well, again, it will come out of reserves either year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3789)|
| 1:03:17| It's kind of six of one, half a dozen of another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3797)|
| 1:03:21| But I think it shows a commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3801)|
| 1:03:23| It gets things moving in the process earlier and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3803)|
| 1:03:28| I'm just surprised it's not in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3808)|
| 1:03:30| There will be one or two other things that will probably be on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3810)|
| 1:03:33| and one of them, I think, may be some additional funding for NPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3813)|
| 1:03:38| There's also been talk last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3818)|
| 1:03:41| Last year we saw a proposal that I guess had failed at the county level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3821)|
| 1:03:46| for a parking garage on Cumberland Avenue, service Cumberland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3826)|
| 1:03:50| Why isn't that in the budget or in the plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3830)|
| 1:03:54| I can speak to that, Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3834)|
| 1:03:56| We don't have that identified yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3836)|
| 1:03:59| So without a specific project, we thought we'd hold off a little further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3839)|
| 1:04:03| until we further along on that and have a garage ready to be funded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3843)|
| 1:04:07| and a clear approach to funding it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3847)|
| 1:04:10| Shouldn't we set the money aside or plan for both of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3850)|
| 1:04:13| while we're doing the budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3853)|
| 1:04:15| I guess that's the part I don't really have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3855)|
| 1:04:17| Those are two big projects that's been publicly talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3857)|
| 1:04:22| We say the budget's the road map for the year to come and the year ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3862)|
| 1:04:26| I guess those are two big things that we've voted on and talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3866)|
| 1:04:30| or at least publicly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3870)|
| 1:04:32| I'm just surprised not to see those included in this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3872)|
| 1:04:36| I think the State Supreme Court's item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3876)|
| 1:04:38| basically the approach there is to take it out of fund balance this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3878)|
| 1:04:42| and not include it in next year's capital budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3882)|
| 1:04:45| and take that approach along with the other adjustments to be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3885)|
| 1:04:49| And on the garage, there are various ways to fund a garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3889)|
| 1:04:52| It does produce revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3892)|
| 1:04:54| It doesn't pay for itself, but it is a revenue producer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3894)|
| 1:04:57| Is that one that would be bonded with revenues from the garage going to pay it back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3897)|
| 1:05:03| Those other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3903)|
| 1:05:04| I think the main thing is until we have a little better idea of that specific project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3904)|
| 1:05:09| we decided not to pursue it in the capital budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3909)|
| 1:05:13| The purchase of the site is, of course, specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3913)|
| 1:05:16| We have to purchase that before we can go ahead and work on redeveloping it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3916)|
| 1:05:20| We have a budget number, or we have some number to at least talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3920)|
| 1:05:23| I mean, to me, it's no different than the Jackson Warehouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3923)|
| 1:05:27| You put a number in there for $150,000 for a master developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3927)|
| 1:05:31| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3931)|
| 1:05:32| That's just a placeholder, right, is the way you said it to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3932)|
| 1:05:36| Yes, it's an estimate, somewhat informed estimate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3936)|
| 1:05:39| but basically a placeholder as well based on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3939)|
| 1:05:42| But not yet on a specific proposal or even what the proposal would look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3942)|
| 1:05:47| It's kind of a placeholder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3947)|
| 1:05:48| And those two things would be that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3948)|
| 1:05:51| I just don't understand why they're not in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3951)|
| 1:05:55| Mayor Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3955)|
| 1:05:56| Yes, I have a question about you talked about transportation and fuel costs and all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3956)|
| 1:06:03| Is it feasible now to look at some use of electric vehicles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3963)|
| 1:06:10| I don't know if we're using any at all, or is that something that we've talked about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3970)|
| 1:06:18| I don't think we have any purely electric vehicles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3978)|
| 1:06:21| and maybe some golf carts and gators and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3981)|
| 1:06:27| Again, I'm not the best person to address this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3987)|
| 1:06:30| We are looking at alternative fuels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3990)|
| 1:06:35| That includes CNG, you know, various other forms of alternative transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=3995)|
| 1:06:45| We have several hybrid vehicles in terms of cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4005)|
| 1:06:52| Now, I mean, I suppose we could look at electrical vehicles for certain functions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4012)|
| 1:07:00| but if you look at our total fleet, and we have a very large fleet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4020)|
| 1:07:04| We have well over $40 million in vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4024)|
| 1:07:08| Most of those things, again, you probably get a bigger bang| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4028)|
| 1:07:12| at focusing on, you know, like CNG and, you know, the new types of diesel fuels rather than electric| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4032)|
| 1:07:22| because you're looking mostly at fire vehicles, police vehicles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4042)|
| 1:07:26| where you don't have the range on an electric vehicle that you need for police functions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4046)|
| 1:07:34| So, I mean, to me, an electrical vehicle would only work for certain types of administrative vehicles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4054)|
| 1:07:41| where you don't have the, you know, don't drive as much as you would in, say, police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4061)|
| 1:07:48| But, again, the largest fleets are police, fire, and public service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4068)|
| 1:07:53| and public service is all heavy equipment, and this could be my lack of ignorance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4073)|
| 1:07:58| I don't know of any electrical, you know, vehicles in those larger type vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4078)|
| 1:08:04| But, again, I do know that we are looking at CNG and other types of vehicles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4084)|
| 1:08:10| and I know that, for example, we've got allocation for hybrid buses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4090)|
| 1:08:15| That's one of the things we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4095)|
| 1:08:17| But it's almost reached the point now where the clean diesel buses get, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4097)|
| 1:08:24| are as efficient as the hybrid buses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4104)|
| 1:08:27| So, again, we're always looking at those things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4107)|
| 1:08:30| and, again, it's just a way to try and improve the environment and also hold down cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4110)|
| 1:08:36| But it depends on what the market is for those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4116)|
| 1:08:39| And the fleet director, Keith Shields, will be here a little bit later today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4119)|
| 1:08:42| He can give you some more information on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4122)|
| 1:08:44| And I think Dawn can probably touch on the buses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4124)|
| 1:08:47| because she's just got back from conference, the national conference last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4127)|
| 1:08:51| where they talked about how well the diesel buses are working as compared to the hybrids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4131)|
| 1:08:57| So she can give you some more information about that shortly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4137)|
| 1:08:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4139)|
| 1:09:03| I've probably talked enough, so unless there's any other questions, I'm going to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4143)|
| 1:09:08| I'm going to get out of here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4148)|
| 1:09:12| We decided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4152)|
| 1:09:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4153)|
| 1:09:14| You did a great job, as always.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4154)|
| 1:09:18| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4158)|
| 1:09:22| So we'll move on here to anything else, Bill or Christy, that you all would?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4162)|
| 1:09:31| I think we've pretty much got the overview down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4171)|
| 1:09:34| We can move into the specific departments now, if you wish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4174)|
| 1:09:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4177)|
| 1:09:38| I think first up is Mr. Strickland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4178)|
| 1:09:44| If you all want to refer to the handout, page one, for the mayor's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4184)|
| 1:09:49| and all the offices within her office, all the different divisions within there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4189)|
| 1:09:54| And on your capital projects list, if you have specific projects to ask about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4194)|
| 1:10:01| it's page one on the capital handout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4201)|
| 1:10:12| Good morning, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4212)|
| 1:10:14| Good morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4214)|
| 1:10:25| Are there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4225)|
| 1:10:31| This is my first time coming before this esteemed body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4231)|
| 1:10:36| Usually Jim handles everything for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4236)|
| 1:10:40| Let me just kind of give you a feeder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4240)|
| 1:10:44| One of the significant changes in the budget for Tanken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4244)|
| 1:10:49| and I don't know whether you're interested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4249)|
| 1:10:51| is there's $50,000 set aside for Save Our Sons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4251)|
| 1:10:56| and it's probably, again, he's much better at answering those kinds of things than I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4256)|
| 1:11:02| But that is the major difference between his budget for this year and next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4262)|
| 1:11:10| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4270)|
| 1:11:11| On the mayor's office itself, are the salaries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4271)|
| 1:11:17| does that reflect the increase that council had passed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4277)|
| 1:11:23| That reflects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4283)|
| 1:11:25| Six and a half months of the new salary and five and a half months of the old salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4285)|
| 1:11:41| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4301)|
| 1:11:45| Could you tell us maybe just a little bit about the Save Our Sons?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4305)|
| 1:11:52| Yes, Save Our Sons is an initiative the mayor is very openly promoting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4312)|
| 1:12:02| And what this is, it's part of Cities United and My Brother's Keeper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4322)|
| 1:12:07| We all know that black-on-black crime is definitely a bad situation all over the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4327)|
| 1:12:15| We have a committee of 11 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4335)|
| 1:12:18| One of the people is Mayor Brown, the mayor, myself, and some other social active people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4338)|
| 1:12:25| Reverend Arnold and Reverend Butler and some others, and the chief of police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4345)|
| 1:12:31| And we know that the hot spots in this particular city are mostly in Brother Mayor Brown's district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4351)|
| 1:12:43| And what we're going to do is combat, try our best to combat some of the efforts to do away with black-on-black crime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4363)|
| 1:12:55| by giving these kids opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4375)|
| 1:13:00| And that's basically what we're still meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4380)|
| 1:13:03| We met yesterday to debrief from a trip that we took to Philadelphia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4383)|
| 1:13:09| So we're still putting together a plan, and we think it's going to be a good plan when we finish with it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4389)|
| 1:13:14| to, you know, curb the criminal activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4394)|
| 1:13:20| Okay, very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4400)|
| 1:13:21| And we all got the data from, of course, the police department because they have 10 years of data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4401)|
| 1:13:27| where all the hot spots are in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4407)|
| 1:13:33| Questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4413)|
| 1:13:34| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4414)|
| 1:13:35| Well, I would comment, I did attend that meeting in Philadelphia, and the mayors of New Orleans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4415)|
| 1:13:43| and Philadelphia, I think, are some of the two prime movers behind that initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4423)|
| 1:13:50| And it's an initiative that will benefit the entire community because if we can find some ways to save our sons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4430)|
| 1:14:02| those basically, I think, ages 18 to 34, something like that, through some mentoring and other types of programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4442)|
| 1:14:13| it certainly would benefit everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4453)|
| 1:14:17| So we're working very hard in meeting and trying to come up with some ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4457)|
| 1:14:22| We have a summit meeting coming up next month, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4462)|
| 1:14:27| Yes, on June 13th we're having a son summit, and this summit will be run by actual kids of this age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4467)|
| 1:14:39| We found in going to these different conferences that the kids know better what's going on than we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4479)|
| 1:14:46| So we're going to let them vent among themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4486)|
| 1:14:50| It will be at the Coliseum Ballroom on the 13th, and it will probably start around 1130 or 12 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4490)|
| 1:14:58| But they're running it, and they will be able to vent, and we will have captured most of the things that they're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4498)|
| 1:15:07| Because we've learned from these conferences that, you know, we as adults try to tell the kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4507)|
| 1:15:13| but the kids know themselves, you know, what's irritating them, what's making them tick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4513)|
| 1:15:20| and so we want to hear from them and capture that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4520)|
| 1:15:25| So that will be part of our overall plan also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4525)|
| 1:15:30| All right, that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4530)|
| 1:15:32| Further questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4532)|
| 1:15:34| If not, we'll move on to Dr. Lyons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4534)|
| 1:15:41| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4541)|
| 1:15:42| As you can see under policy and redevelopment, as you know, we have a number of departments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4542)|
| 1:15:47| and we have communications redevelopment, sustainability, community development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4547)|
| 1:15:52| Also, we meet bi-weekly with the chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4552)|
| 1:15:55| They're down here as well, along with the Office of Business Support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4555)|
| 1:15:59| So I think the thing to do would just allow each person to come up and be prepared to answer any questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4559)|
| 1:16:05| and maybe briefly summarize anything significant in this year's budget that they would like to comment on or stress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4565)|
| 1:16:13| And I guess it's all right, we could just go down the list in the order we have them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4573)|
| 1:16:16| Yes, and I would like for them, if they would, just to kind of give a little very brief overview of what's going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4576)|
| 1:16:24| where you're at, challenges, opportunities, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4584)|
| 1:16:26| So just a little bit more information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4586)|
| 1:16:29| That would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4589)|
| 1:16:30| All right, so Jesse, would you like to start with communications, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4590)|
| 1:16:33| with a summary of anything that's especially anything new,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4593)|
| 1:16:36| but an overall picture of what you're stressing, what we're working on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4596)|
| 1:16:40| and anything in the budget that needs to be highlighted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4600)|
| 1:16:43| So on your detail page, if you look down four categories, you'll see org 11130,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4603)|
| 1:16:50| and that would be what he's discussing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4610)|
| 1:16:55| Mr. Vice Mayor, before you get started, let me ask one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4615)|
| 1:16:59| Dr. Lyons, the increase to one position, tell me a little bit about that, manager three or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4619)|
| 1:17:08| That will be coming in the Office of Redevelopment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4628)|
| 1:17:11| and I think what that points down to is we have so many projects on the ground now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4631)|
| 1:17:15| that you all have approved and gone through the public vetting process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4635)|
| 1:17:19| and the consideration process that we're being highly strained in our ability to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4639)|
| 1:17:25| that those come to fruition in the right way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4645)|
| 1:17:28| and part of the ULI recommendations where we get a little more capacity on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4648)|
| 1:17:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4652)|
| 1:17:33| I'm sorry I remember that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4653)|
| 1:17:37| All right, good morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4657)|
| 1:17:38| Jesse Mayshart, Director of Communications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4658)|
| 1:17:40| I think most of you have a pretty good idea of what we do in the communications department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4660)|
| 1:17:46| but we are essentially, we handle internal and external communications for the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4666)|
| 1:17:53| across most of our departments, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4673)|
| 1:17:55| So we work with everybody up and down the line in terms of getting information out to the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4675)|
| 1:18:03| about city services, city projects and processes, public meetings and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4683)|
| 1:18:10| We handle communications for the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4690)|
| 1:18:14| We do press releases, social media.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4694)|
| 1:18:17| A couple of numbers, in 2014 we produced 210 media releases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4697)|
| 1:18:23| 64 media advisories on City of Knoxville projects, programs and events,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4703)|
| 1:18:28| produced 134 mayoral proclamations, 483 certificates of recognition or achievement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4708)|
| 1:18:35| 30 welcome letters for groups or events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4715)|
| 1:18:40| Probably the most important thing that we've been working on this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4720)|
| 1:18:45| has been revamping the city website, which I sent a link out to everybody earlier this week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4725)|
| 1:18:51| and I hope you've all had a chance to look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4731)|
| 1:18:53| We've gotten some very good feedback, including from Councilwoman Palmer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4733)|
| 1:18:57| who made some really good suggestions that we've already started to implement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4737)|
| 1:19:01| And if anybody else has any questions, concerns, things you would like to see there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4741)|
| 1:19:05| things that you wonder why they're not there, certainly let us know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4745)|
| 1:19:09| We are going to be going officially live with this in the near future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4749)|
| 1:19:13| but then it will be a sort of ongoing process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4753)|
| 1:19:16| This will be the starting point with the new website| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4756)|
| 1:19:19| and we'll be looking to add new and exciting things to it as we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4759)|
| 1:19:23| I also wanted to just make a quick comment in terms of the importance of our role here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4763)|
| 1:19:31| in light of the current media landscape, because media relations is obviously part of what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4771)|
| 1:19:39| And I'm sure you're all aware of some of the changes that have happened nationally and locally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4779)|
| 1:19:44| in terms of the media.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4784)|
| 1:19:46| The reality is that all of the media that we work with here in town, TV stations, newspapers, and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4786)|
| 1:19:52| have fewer resources, especially reporting resources, than they did 10 years ago, 20 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4792)|
| 1:19:59| 20 years ago, 30 years ago, you would have had two daily newspaper reporters here today covering this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4799)|
| 1:20:06| And as you see, there aren't any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4806)|
| 1:20:08| And that's not a reflection on the dedication of the newspaper reporters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4808)|
| 1:20:12| It's that they don't have the people to do the things they used to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4812)|
| 1:20:15| And so that gives us a lot fewer outlets and opportunities to convey information to people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4815)|
| 1:20:22| to tell people about road closures or major projects or really anything we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4822)|
| 1:20:27| The good thing is that we have a lot of other avenues now that didn't exist before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4827)|
| 1:20:32| like our website and social media and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4832)|
| 1:20:35| But what it means is that it's really increasingly incumbent on us, on all of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4835)|
| 1:20:40| all of our department heads and council members and everybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4840)|
| 1:20:44| to get information out directly in whatever way we can because we can't really rely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4844)|
| 1:20:50| And I wish I could say I see that changing in the media environment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4850)|
| 1:20:55| but I have a lot of friends who work in the local media, and it's rough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4855)|
| 1:20:59| And so I just think it's something for all of us to keep in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4859)|
| 1:21:02| Sometimes people think about communications like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4862)|
| 1:21:04| oh, you guys just put out puffy press releases and whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4864)|
| 1:21:08| And sure, we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4868)|
| 1:21:09| We do put out some puffy press releases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4869)|
| 1:21:12| But much more importantly, we're really a vehicle to tell the citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4872)|
| 1:21:16| who have hired all of us to do these jobs what we're doing and why we're doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4876)|
| 1:21:20| And if we're closing their road, here's why we're closing their road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4880)|
| 1:21:23| and here's when it will be open again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4883)|
| 1:21:25| and all of those kinds of things that people really need and want to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4885)|
| 1:21:28| So with that, if anybody has any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4888)|
| 1:21:33| I think it's more I've heard you talk since you've been here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4893)|
| 1:21:36| I prefer to be behind the scenes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4896)|
| 1:21:38| That's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4898)|
| 1:21:39| Councilman DelVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4899)|
| 1:21:40| Yeah, does that mean that with fewer reporters you can create more stories| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4900)|
| 1:21:45| that they just encompass wholeheartedly in their newspaper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4905)|
| 1:21:49| and don't challenge what you're saying or doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4909)|
| 1:21:53| You could look at it that way, and I think it is true sometimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4913)|
| 1:21:57| that there is a thirst for content out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4917)|
| 1:22:00| and they don't have as many people providing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4920)|
| 1:22:02| So you will see, like we'll put out a press release,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4922)|
| 1:22:04| and sometimes it will just be taken and essentially posted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4924)|
| 1:22:07| on some media outlet's website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4927)|
| 1:22:09| And so, yes, sure, that allows us, I guess, to, you could say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4929)|
| 1:22:13| drive the narrative a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4933)|
| 1:22:15| But the reality is there are just fewer places to drive that narrative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4935)|
| 1:22:19| and it's also the message is much more diffused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4939)|
| 1:22:22| You can't rely on just because the story was in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4942)|
| 1:22:25| The New Sentinel has half the circulation that it did 20 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4945)|
| 1:22:29| When I went to work there in 1994, their daily was about 130,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4949)|
| 1:22:33| Now they're at about 65,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4953)|
| 1:22:35| Are the blogs picking up the difference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4955)|
| 1:22:37| Is that what's happening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4957)|
| 1:22:39| Yeah, blogs, but it's not just local stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4959)|
| 1:22:42| People are as likely to be reading about Kim Kardashian,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4962)|
| 1:22:45| more likely to be reading about Kim Kardashian| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4965)|
| 1:22:47| than they are about what the city of Knoxville is doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4967)|
| 1:22:50| So it's hard for all of us to get our message out and our information out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4970)|
| 1:22:55| and so it's just something we have to kind of keep working at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4975)|
| 1:22:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4978)|
| 1:23:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4981)|
| 1:23:02| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4982)|
| 1:23:03| I don't see any other lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4983)|
| 1:23:05| Judith, Ms. Folks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4985)|
| 1:23:07| Okay, and while she's coming up, her budget is also on that same page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4987)|
| 1:23:11| It's the org that says 1-1-1-1-40,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4991)|
| 1:23:14| and she also would handle any questions related to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4994)|
| 1:23:18| the miscellaneous special revenue funds for special events,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=4998)|
| 1:23:22| which includes the ice rink money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5002)|
| 1:23:25| That's on page 23.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5005)|
| 1:23:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5007)|
| 1:23:28| Good morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5008)|
| 1:23:29| Judith Folks, Director of Special Events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5009)|
| 1:23:32| Basically, you all are fairly familiar with what we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5012)|
| 1:23:36| but we assist the mayor with ribbon-cuttings press conferences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5016)|
| 1:23:40| employee benefits luncheon, employee appreciation luncheon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5020)|
| 1:23:44| mayor's budget luncheon, as well as hosting delegations from other countries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5024)|
| 1:23:49| and an array of other events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5029)|
| 1:23:52| We have about approximately 1,000 events come through our office a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5032)|
| 1:23:59| and we make sure each of these events fill out the required forms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5039)|
| 1:24:06| we check locations, just logistics, road closures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5046)|
| 1:24:13| and insurance coverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5053)|
| 1:24:15| And on top of that, I'm not sure if you all are aware,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5055)|
| 1:24:19| but our team, especially myself in most instances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5059)|
| 1:24:24| is on site for each of these events on the weekends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5064)|
| 1:24:28| We try to be there to make sure that everything is going smoothly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5068)|
| 1:24:33| Another thing that we do offer to the community of anyone arranging a special event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5073)|
| 1:24:42| is the fourth Thursday of each month we have a special events meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5082)|
| 1:24:49| where the event organizers can come meet with all the city departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5089)|
| 1:24:54| that are tied into their event, KPD, public service, fire department, CAT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5094)|
| 1:25:02| Oh, gosh, we've got facilities, traffic engineering, parks and recs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5102)|
| 1:25:09| So we put everybody together once a month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5109)|
| 1:25:12| inviting all the event coordinators to come,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5112)|
| 1:25:15| and we also try during that meeting they can meet with everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5115)|
| 1:25:19| to make sure that their event is safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5119)|
| 1:25:25| We try to make sure that everybody has a safe, great experience in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5125)|
| 1:25:29| for these events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5129)|
| 1:25:32| Our office produces, coordinates, and expedites Festival on the Fourth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5132)|
| 1:25:38| Christmas in the City with our rooftop tree campaign, window decorating contest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5138)|
| 1:25:44| and that's all to involve the businesses and residences downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5144)|
| 1:25:51| Of course, we do the lighting of the tree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5151)|
| 1:25:54| and I will bring up the fact that there is an additional cost in our budget this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5154)|
| 1:26:05| that is reflected in the fact that we have asked for a new Christmas tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5165)|
| 1:26:12| Our tree, the average lifespan for a Christmas tree is 10 years for a commercial tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5172)|
| 1:26:20| Ours is a 14-year-old tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5180)|
| 1:26:23| And the guys have done a great job, our public service guys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5183)|
| 1:26:27| trying to patch the dry-rotted evergreen, the greenery and the holes and that sort of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5187)|
| 1:26:33| but we're kind of at that point that it is time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5193)|
| 1:26:37| and we feel that that's a huge reflection of our city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5197)|
| 1:26:42| and the revitalization and the beautification that we're trying to do for the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5202)|
| 1:26:47| especially during the holidays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5207)|
| 1:26:50| If you're down on Gay Street, any time during the holidays,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5210)|
| 1:26:54| you'll see lots of people taking pictures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5214)|
| 1:26:57| and we're trying to fill in the dry-rotted holes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5217)|
| 1:27:00| So it would be really nice to have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5220)|
| 1:27:03| Green spray paint, maybe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5223)|
| 1:27:05| We've tried that, too, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5225)|
| 1:27:09| So besides that, of course, we do the ice rink, which is a part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5229)|
| 1:27:15| At this point, I am working on more sponsorships for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5235)|
| 1:27:21| We do have, we're very lucky to have Home Federal as a partner for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5241)|
| 1:27:26| I have gone back to them already for this year to add an additional couple thousand each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5246)|
| 1:27:32| I try to bring them up just a little more for sponsorships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5252)|
| 1:27:36| So we are hoping that they will continue to be a great partner for us with the ice rink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5256)|
| 1:27:42| And, of course, we're trying to extend the ice rink's hour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5262)|
| 1:27:46| the date through January this coming year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5266)|
| 1:27:51| We had a lot of people calling after we closed the rink the first week of January,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5271)|
| 1:27:56| wanting us to extend that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5276)|
| 1:27:59| Anyway, so we've got New Year's Eve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5279)|
| 1:28:01| We've got Concerts on the Square, which is in full swing right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5281)|
| 1:28:05| and CBID has helped us with funding for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5285)|
| 1:28:09| So just to close, I work on trying to get sponsorships for these events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5289)|
| 1:28:17| They're all free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5297)|
| 1:28:19| We want to keep these events free to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5299)|
| 1:28:25| Questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5305)|
| 1:28:30| After the fall elections, do you think there will be any savings in ribbons?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5310)|
| 1:28:36| We recycle ribbons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5316)|
| 1:28:39| Seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5319)|
| 1:28:42| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5322)|
| 1:28:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5323)|
| 1:28:45| We'll move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5325)|
| 1:28:46| Ms. White?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5326)|
| 1:28:47| I have a question for Becky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5327)|
| 1:28:49| Her funding is not included in the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5329)|
| 1:28:52| It's on page 4 of the handout under Community Development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5332)|
| 1:28:56| and she also administers the housing grants and the Fund 290 on pages 24 and 25 under Other Funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5336)|
| 1:29:06| Good morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5346)|
| 1:29:07| Becky Wade, Director of Community Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5347)|
| 1:29:09| As you know, the Community Development Department is funded with federal HUD grant funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5349)|
| 1:29:16| as well as city general funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5356)|
| 1:29:19| The federal budget was presented to council and approved last month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5359)|
| 1:29:23| along with our annual action plan and our five-year consolidated plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5363)|
| 1:29:28| That was submitted to HUD last week, and we anticipate their approval within 45 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5368)|
| 1:29:35| So what I'll be talking about today is our general-funded operating funds and capital funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5375)|
| 1:29:44| Community Development houses several offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5384)|
| 1:29:47| We have the Office of Disability Services, which is staffed by Stephanie Cook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5387)|
| 1:29:53| Stephanie is a great resource to the city on all kinds of accessibility issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5393)|
| 1:29:59| whether it's sidewalk replacement or new public service complex or bathrooms on Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5399)|
| 1:30:06| Stephanie serves as a great resource to make sure that the city is meeting not only the letter of the ADA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5406)|
| 1:30:15| but also the spirit of the ADA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5415)|
| 1:30:18| She also staffs the Council on Disability Issues, the Mayor's Council on Disability Issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5418)|
| 1:30:25| and last week we celebrated the 30th year of that organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5425)|
| 1:30:29| so we're happy to be working with them continually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5429)|
| 1:30:34| Stephanie also handles all employee accessibility requests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5434)|
| 1:30:41| and takes a tremendous amount of calls from the general public on any accessibility issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5441)|
| 1:30:48| We also house the Office on Homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5448)|
| 1:30:51| That's staffed by Mike Dunthorne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5451)|
| 1:30:54| Mike staffs the Mayor's Roundtable on Homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5454)|
| 1:30:59| He also staffs the City's Continuum of Care and the Council on Homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5459)|
| 1:31:13| He actually writes the application for the Continuum of Care for all the homeless agencies in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5473)|
| 1:31:22| He also has the Office of Neighborhoods, but David's got his own slot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5482)|
| 1:31:25| so I'll let him talk about that in a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5485)|
| 1:31:30| We have a total of 20 staff persons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5490)|
| 1:31:33| Fourteen are paid with federal funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5493)|
| 1:31:35| Six are paid with city general funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5495)|
| 1:31:38| Just a few highlights of our past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5498)|
| 1:31:42| We did successfully complete our five-year consolidated plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5502)|
| 1:31:46| We had a public engagement process that lasted about six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5506)|
| 1:31:51| I'm very proud to say that we got over 900 responses to our survey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5511)|
| 1:31:55| and we engaged many citizens and agencies and partners that we work with on a regular basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5515)|
| 1:32:02| I'd like to commend Linda Rust, our Community Development Administrator, for her work on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5522)|
| 1:32:09| It was the first time that we had to submit this electronically, and it was a big undertaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5529)|
| 1:32:20| We also issued, with the help of our wonderful Purchasing Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5540)|
| 1:32:25| requests for proposals for historic preservation funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5545)|
| 1:32:29| We're working to give out eight awards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5549)|
| 1:32:33| We're working on those contracts now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5553)|
| 1:32:35| and I'm very pleased that the mayor has included an additional $500,000 in next year's budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5555)|
| 1:32:43| so that we can do this again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5563)|
| 1:32:47| As far as blighted and chronic problem properties, we acquired 20 properties in the last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5567)|
| 1:32:53| one of which was the former South High, which is a major accomplishment for our department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5573)|
| 1:32:59| We will issue a request for proposals for redevelopment of that building this summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5579)|
| 1:33:06| We sold 17 properties through our Homemakers Program as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5586)|
| 1:33:11| We right now have 16 commercial façade projects underway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5591)|
| 1:33:15| We have revamped our application process and review process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5595)|
| 1:33:20| and we feel like we have a really good competitive process now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5600)|
| 1:33:24| That's an extremely popular program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5604)|
| 1:33:28| It not only creates jobs, but helps to stabilize neighborhoods and commercial corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5608)|
| 1:33:37| Our additional requests for this year include $60,000 for staff costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5617)|
| 1:33:44| and that is when we have staff that is funded primarily with federal funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5624)|
| 1:33:50| that are working on general funded projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5630)|
| 1:33:55| It is a prohibition that federal funds pay for staff when they're working on non-federally funded projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5635)|
| 1:34:02| so we need these funds to charge time too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5642)|
| 1:34:06| We also have an additional request for $150,000 for the community schools effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5646)|
| 1:34:13| through the Great Schools Partnership, and that is so that they can add three more community schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5653)|
| 1:34:19| This has been very successful, and we're pleased to support them as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5659)|
| 1:34:27| Our capital requests include $250,000 in ADA access improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5667)|
| 1:34:34| These are for city facilities that need to meet ADA requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5674)|
| 1:34:40| so we've got to do numerous improvements to various structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5680)|
| 1:34:45| We're in the first phase of review of all our facilities right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5685)|
| 1:34:51| We have $300,000 in chronic problem property acquisition, $200,000 in blighted property acquisition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5691)|
| 1:34:59| $500,000 for our commercial facade improvement program, $800,000 for the Five Points development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5699)|
| 1:35:08| $100,000 for the rehabilitation of Walter P. Taylor Homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5708)|
| 1:35:11| This will be year seven of our 10-year commitment to that project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5711)|
| 1:35:17| And although it's reflected in the Special Revenue Fund, the $500,000 for historic preservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5717)|
| 1:35:24| So I would be happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5724)|
| 1:35:27| Questions from council members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5727)|
| 1:35:30| Thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5730)|
| 1:35:32| Becky, on the blighted properties that we have purchased and then turned around and sold,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5732)|
| 1:35:40| just comment on that program and its, I hope, success and holding success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5740)|
| 1:35:47| In other words, I know there is a provision that if those that purchase it have not done what they've agreed to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5747)|
| 1:35:54| you pull them back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5754)|
| 1:35:55| Has that ever occurred?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5755)|
| 1:35:57| That has occurred, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5757)|
| 1:36:00| We have had an incident where someone purchased a property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5760)|
| 1:36:05| They did not rehabilitate it in a timely manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5765)|
| 1:36:09| They started, didn't finish, and we had to execute our quick claim deed so that it came back to the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5769)|
| 1:36:17| and then we relisted in Homemakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5777)|
| 1:36:19| Yes, the purpose of selling properties, blighted properties through Homemakers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5779)|
| 1:36:26| is to change ownership of the property, get it into the hands of responsible owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5786)|
| 1:36:33| who want to redevelop it and get it back on the tax rolls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5793)|
| 1:36:38| It's been a great tool to revitalize neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5798)|
| 1:36:43| and we've seen this all over Knoxville have a big impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5803)|
| 1:36:49| Councilman Delbo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5809)|
| 1:36:50| Yes, thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5810)|
| 1:36:52| Becky, I guess we suffer through the shrinking federal budget grants and stuff from HUD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5812)|
| 1:36:59| What do you see going forward in terms of funding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5819)|
| 1:37:02| Are we going to have to come up with more general funds to fill the gap in order to continue the kind of work we're doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5822)|
| 1:37:08| What do you see us forecasting out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5828)|
| 1:37:13| In the near term, we were at a HUD meeting yesterday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5833)|
| 1:37:17| and the budget that's on the table right now for 2016, which is not next year but the year after that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5837)|
| 1:37:24| will be flat funding for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5844)|
| 1:37:27| So we're happy about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5847)|
| 1:37:29| Same as this year, you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5849)|
| 1:37:30| Same as this year, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5850)|
| 1:37:31| They're actually pulling some funds from the federal housing trust fund to fill a gap in the home program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5851)|
| 1:37:38| So we might actually get a little bit more in home funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5858)|
| 1:37:41| But, yeah, we've predicted probably that our funds will continue to shrink as time goes forward, our federal dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5861)|
| 1:37:51| And, yeah, it's a great benefit to our department to be able to access general capital dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5871)|
| 1:37:59| as well as some operating money so that we can continue to do the projects that we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5879)|
| 1:38:05| The second question was, do we have any way of measuring, and that's a funny term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5885)|
| 1:38:11| but measuring like maybe an increase in property tax or sales tax when we do these facade improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5891)|
| 1:38:18| and the businesses kind of uplift a little bit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5898)|
| 1:38:20| Do we have any sense of the return on that investment, as a matter of curiosity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5900)|
| 1:38:25| Yes, and I can send you this study we did about a year ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5905)|
| 1:38:28| We tracked the effect of the commercial facade improvement program from its inception, which was in 2006,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5908)|
| 1:38:38| and property taxes on those particular properties doubled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5918)|
| 1:38:43| So I can send you the actual amount of money that the city is now gaining because of those investments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5923)|
| 1:38:53| So we're gaining far more than we have invested in the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5933)|
| 1:38:57| Yeah, and it kind of jolts the neighbor next door to think about their own business and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5937)|
| 1:39:01| I would like to see the study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5941)|
| 1:39:03| I'll be happy to send that to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5943)|
| 1:39:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5945)|
| 1:39:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5947)|
| 1:39:08| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5948)|
| 1:39:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5949)|
| 1:39:10| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5950)|
| 1:39:11| Massey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5951)|
| 1:39:16| Good morning, Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5956)|
| 1:39:17| David Massey, Office of Neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5957)|
| 1:39:20| As you know, the Office of Neighborhoods exists to improve the quality of life in our residential neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5960)|
| 1:39:27| by supporting resident-led, resident-controlled neighborhood associations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5967)|
| 1:39:33| and helping unorganized neighborhoods organize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5973)|
| 1:39:37| And we do that through a number of different programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5977)|
| 1:39:42| We have a staff of four of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5982)|
| 1:39:46| As you know, Debbie Sharp joined the Office of Neighborhoods back in the fall, and she is full-time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5986)|
| 1:39:54| And we have two AmeriCorps workers working on a couple of different programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=5994)|
| 1:40:00| and those are funded out of community development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6000)|
| 1:40:06| So our programs are wide-ranging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6006)|
| 1:40:10| As you know, we staff the Neighborhood Advisory Council that you all help us find members for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6010)|
| 1:40:17| and that are appointed by the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6017)|
| 1:40:20| And they're a very active group and are constantly bringing issues to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6020)|
| 1:40:24| and we are taking things to them to vet with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6024)|
| 1:40:30| We have our biannual neighborhood conference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6030)|
| 1:40:33| Because Debbie joined us this year, we were able to increase the size of that conference by 50%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6033)|
| 1:40:39| We had 700 people at the conference this year and 80 information booths| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6039)|
| 1:40:45| and generally felt like it was a successful event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6045)|
| 1:40:49| I want to again acknowledge Councilman Wallace for his support in helping us identify sponsorships for that event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6049)|
| 1:41:01| We need to and do supplement the $18,000 in miscellaneous meeting expenses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6061)|
| 1:41:08| that goes to that conference with sponsorships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6068)|
| 1:41:12| And then every other year we have a Neighborhood Networking and Awards Luncheon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6072)|
| 1:41:17| So in 2016, that luncheon, it's a smaller event, as you may recall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6077)|
| 1:41:22| and we will do that again this coming March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6082)|
| 1:41:25| So every year we have one or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6085)|
| 1:41:29| We have a leadership training program, Building Strong Neighborhood Organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6089)|
| 1:41:33| and that will have its third iteration this fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6093)|
| 1:41:38| We've now graduated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6098)|
| 1:41:40| I don't have the exact number, but it's over 30 people have been involved in that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6100)|
| 1:41:44| and some of those people have not only strengthened existing organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6104)|
| 1:41:50| but have gone on to help organize new groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6110)|
| 1:41:55| We have, with the help of one of our AmeriCorps workers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6115)|
| 1:41:58| our Neighborhood Disaster Preparedness Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6118)|
| 1:42:01| We're still in very much of an early initial phase for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6121)|
| 1:42:05| but we're starting to get some traction for that, and we're very excited about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6125)|
| 1:42:11| It folds into what we're trying to do with preparedness and sustainability across the whole city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6131)|
| 1:42:20| and both police and fire and KEMA and other agencies have worked closely with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6140)|
| 1:42:26| and are very supportive of us trying to fill that gap between family preparedness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6146)|
| 1:42:32| at a very individual level and community-wide preparedness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6152)|
| 1:42:36| that KEMA and the emergency agencies do so well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6156)|
| 1:42:41| We also work closely with community development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6161)|
| 1:42:45| and the Neighborhood Code Enforcement Office on blight programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6165)|
| 1:42:50| This past May we graduated our second Fight the Blight class,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6170)|
| 1:42:56| and those people then are eligible to become part of a neighborhood working group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6176)|
| 1:43:00| which meets six times a year with the relevant departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6180)|
| 1:43:04| to basically kind of attack the blighted properties that are falling between the cracks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6184)|
| 1:43:11| and educating one another and neighborhoods educating us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6191)|
| 1:43:15| and we educating neighborhoods about the whole blight process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6195)|
| 1:43:19| and how we can all do a better job of trying to address these very, very difficult issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6199)|
| 1:43:28| We provide consultation services to neighborhood organizations all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6208)|
| 1:43:32| We're constantly fielding telephone calls from neighborhood groups and from a lot of individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6212)|
| 1:43:39| Sometimes I think that if the word neighborhood comes up in a 311 call, it comes to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6219)|
| 1:43:45| Not always the case, maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6225)|
| 1:43:48| And then, of course, we have our weekly newsletter, our almost weekly newsletter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6228)|
| 1:43:53| and neighborhood directory and other communication tools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6233)|
| 1:43:58| So what is really brand new this year, or not brand new,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6238)|
| 1:44:02| but we revived our Neighborhood Small Grants Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6242)|
| 1:44:05| As you know, that's on your agenda next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6245)|
| 1:44:09| As Jim mentioned, in the last couple of years, 30,000 has been appropriated for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6249)|
| 1:44:15| but we set that aside until we could revive the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6255)|
| 1:44:21| In 2009, 10, and 11, that program was being run the last years of a multiyear program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6261)|
| 1:44:28| that East Tennessee Foundation ran, and then in those last three years, we funded it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6268)|
| 1:44:34| We mutually decided that we needed to take a pause to work on other capacity-building kinds of programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6274)|
| 1:44:42| That's when we were able to add the conference in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6282)|
| 1:44:45| That's when we were able to add leadership training in and these other programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6285)|
| 1:44:50| And so now we're ready to get back into it, so we've got 12 awards coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6290)|
| 1:44:56| We did ask Jim to pull 15,000 out of that set-aside money to combine with the regular 30,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6296)|
| 1:45:04| for a $45,000 appropriation for this year for Neighborhood Small Grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6304)|
| 1:45:09| We're going to be going to the Neighborhood Advisory Council to talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6309)|
| 1:45:13| what kind of requests for proposals we'll come out with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6313)|
| 1:45:16| For example, we may do something that just targets funding for newsletters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6316)|
| 1:45:21| because we think that door-to-door communication in hard copy form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6321)|
| 1:45:27| is a really important thing for neighborhood groups to do, not to rely on Facebook entirely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6327)|
| 1:45:31| not to rely on email entirely, but to have that physical presence in communications with their neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6331)|
| 1:45:38| We may also be able to do something along the lines of some neighborhood planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6338)|
| 1:45:46| that we could get some help on with East Tennessee Community Design Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6346)|
| 1:45:50| I think that covers everything I wanted to talk about, so I'll be glad to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6350)|
| 1:45:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6357)|
| 1:45:59| Has there been any development in the traffic calming study?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6359)|
| 1:46:03| We were working with engineers and trying to revamp that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6363)|
| 1:46:06| and it kind of seems to have extended its life in terms of getting on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6366)|
| 1:46:10| Yeah, and that ball has been in my court, Councilman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6370)|
| 1:46:13| but just partly because of Debbie being in the office now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6373)|
| 1:46:18| I've been able to turn my attention back to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6378)|
| 1:46:21| I've had a couple of meetings with Jeffrey Branham, the chief traffic engineer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6381)|
| 1:46:25| and we're hoping to get something to the administration on that shortly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6385)|
| 1:46:29| Okay, and the second question was, given what Jesse was telling us about the website| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6389)|
| 1:46:35| and being new and improved and all that stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6395)|
| 1:46:37| is there any possibility that you might prepare, I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6397)|
| 1:46:41| videos or instructional information for neighborhoods?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6401)|
| 1:46:45| What happens is there's a lot of turnover in who is the officer of the moment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6405)|
| 1:46:51| or the person taking charge, and it would be nice for them to go to a place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6411)|
| 1:46:55| where you don't have to repeat yourself 5,000 times and give some basic information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6415)|
| 1:46:59| I don't know if you can capture a YouTube thing or a little pamphlet or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6419)|
| 1:47:04| but maybe you can save some of your time so you can focus on other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6424)|
| 1:47:08| Are you looking at that at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6428)|
| 1:47:10| Sure, I think that's a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6430)|
| 1:47:12| We're always looking for ways that we can push information out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6432)|
| 1:47:17| We actually are working on a FAQ for both neighborhood organizations and the general public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6437)|
| 1:47:25| So, for example, we get questions all the time about solicitations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6445)|
| 1:47:29| you know, what's legal, what's not, scams and that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6449)|
| 1:47:34| And so we've got a two-page article that we've run in the newsletter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6454)|
| 1:47:40| and we just need to get that up on the website and make that one of the FAQs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6460)|
| 1:47:44| Yeah, I think if you think of those groups as having a lot of internal turnover,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6464)|
| 1:47:47| that will probably save you some energy and get more information out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6467)|
| 1:47:51| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6471)|
| 1:47:53| Further questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6473)|
| 1:47:54| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6474)|
| 1:47:55| Yes, I don't have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6475)|
| 1:47:56| I just want to make a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6476)|
| 1:47:58| I want to thank you for that newsletter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6478)|
| 1:48:00| It's very helpful because we have a lot of neighborhood organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6480)|
| 1:48:06| and I attended two on yesterday in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6486)|
| 1:48:09| So that newsletter is very helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6489)|
| 1:48:12| Keep it coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6492)|
| 1:48:13| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6493)|
| 1:48:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6494)|
| 1:48:16| Seeing no further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6496)|
| 1:48:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6497)|
| 1:48:19| Mr. Wessel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6499)|
| 1:48:33| Your final budget hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6513)|
| 1:48:36| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6516)|
| 1:48:40| Since you mentioned it, I've been thinking about telling this story,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6520)|
| 1:48:42| so I think I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6522)|
| 1:48:43| I've done this 22 or 23 times now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6523)|
| 1:48:45| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6525)|
| 1:48:46| I think my favorite story of all the years looking through it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6526)|
| 1:48:49| was when Jack Sharp was vice mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6529)|
| 1:48:51| and he and Carlene Malone did not always get along or agree on opinions at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6531)|
| 1:48:56| So Carlene had to get up and step out of the room for about ten minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6536)|
| 1:48:59| and Jack got public service, engineering, and fleet all the way through their hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6539)|
| 1:49:08| Did you hear that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6548)|
| 1:49:10| It continues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6550)|
| 1:49:11| I was wondering if Nick needed a break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6551)|
| 1:49:13| It's a fourth district thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6553)|
| 1:49:15| I just thought I'd share that with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6555)|
| 1:49:17| No, it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6557)|
| 1:49:20| Bob Wessel, director of the Office of Redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6560)|
| 1:49:23| As you all know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6563)|
| 1:49:24| our motto forever has been to move from disinvestment to investment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6564)|
| 1:49:26| the core of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6566)|
| 1:49:28| We feel like we've done a good job with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6568)|
| 1:49:29| We're thinking about changing our new tagline for this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6569)|
| 1:49:32| It will be road closed, detour ahead, the way things are going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6572)|
| 1:49:37| So we've been able to get things off the sheet and onto the ground,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6577)|
| 1:49:40| and we're real proud of that, and we'll talk some about that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6580)|
| 1:49:44| Just quickly, operating budget, there's almost nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6584)|
| 1:49:47| We have a four-person staff, myself, Don Michelle, Ann Wallace, and Rick Emmett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6587)|
| 1:49:52| working redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6592)|
| 1:49:53| Don Michelle will talk to you here in a minute about South Waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6593)|
| 1:49:56| Rick will talk to you about downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6596)|
| 1:49:58| Ann had to go to our weekly Cumberland Avenue coordinating meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6598)|
| 1:50:01| It's at 10 o'clock every Thursday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6601)|
| 1:50:03| so she's there this morning as we continue to work on that project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6603)|
| 1:50:07| So those are the four in the staff, and we'll go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6607)|
| 1:50:12| Capital, we have very small capital coming this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6612)|
| 1:50:15| The biggest thing is $500,000 for Magnolia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6615)|
| 1:50:18| That's to kind of move that project forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6618)|
| 1:50:21| But for the most part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6621)|
| 1:50:22| we're implementing much of the stuff that was put in in past years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6622)|
| 1:50:25| and trying to make sure we get those closed down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6625)|
| 1:50:27| So with that said, let me kind of give you an update on a few of our projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6627)|
| 1:50:30| and I'll try to be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6630)|
| 1:50:34| A couple of things that have wrapped up or are just about to wrap up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6634)|
| 1:50:36| Our downtown wayfinding program that Ann has managed is about to wrap up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6636)|
| 1:50:40| It's been very successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6640)|
| 1:50:41| People are very happy with that, as we see, and talk to people downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6641)|
| 1:50:44| Looking very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6644)|
| 1:50:46| The Dale Avenue street skate, Soccer Sansom Complex that you all have supported.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6646)|
| 1:50:50| I'm not sure if you all have been by to look at Dale Avenue now, but it's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6650)|
| 1:50:54| They've completed their part of the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6654)|
| 1:50:56| We're completing ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6656)|
| 1:50:57| We hope this afternoon that our part will be pretty much completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6657)|
| 1:51:00| So that's going to be off the books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6660)|
| 1:51:04| Obviously, on the books, the biggest project going right now is the Cumberland Avenue redo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6664)|
| 1:51:12| Our official part of that project really hasn't started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6672)|
| 1:51:15| This has all been the utility work that's preparatory to our part of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6675)|
| 1:51:19| We will start on June the 8th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6679)|
| 1:51:21| and that is when the eastbound closures on Kingston Pike will occur,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6681)|
| 1:51:24| and they will occur for up to six weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6684)|
| 1:51:26| How long that will occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6686)|
| 1:51:28| The good news there is the westbound lanes will open up in front of the Exxon there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6688)|
| 1:51:32| where we've had that situation there for a long period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6692)|
| 1:51:35| So that will move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6695)|
| 1:51:36| So things are on schedule over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6696)|
| 1:51:38| The really good news is you talk to KUB and talk to their contractor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6698)|
| 1:51:41| things are moving on the schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6701)|
| 1:51:43| They'd hoped they'd run into a couple of interesting bits of history,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6703)|
| 1:51:45| but nothing slowed them down as they dig down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6705)|
| 1:51:47| I would remind you, on our first phase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6707)|
| 1:51:49| we'll be digging down 14 feet in the middle of Cumberland Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6709)|
| 1:51:52| to get the stormwater pipe down to the water quality units and into Third Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6712)|
| 1:51:56| So it's a massive undertaking that we're getting ready to do, this redo is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6716)|
| 1:52:00| So everybody just needs to be supportive and helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6720)|
| 1:52:02| The Cumberland Connect website, I hope you all have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6722)|
| 1:52:05| It's a great tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6725)|
| 1:52:06| It tells you what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6726)|
| 1:52:08| Get the push text, and it'll tell you as things change and evolve over there what's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6728)|
| 1:52:15| Cumberland Connect app.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6735)|
| 1:52:17| Get the Connect, get the app, get it on your phone, you'll know what's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6737)|
| 1:52:20| Plus you can find coupons and go down and support the merchants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6740)|
| 1:52:22| You can go down and eat less expensively at some places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6742)|
| 1:52:25| So Cumberland's up and running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6745)|
| 1:52:27| If you have any questions on that later, we'll talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6747)|
| 1:52:32| Also, a couple of north projects I'm going to talk about, just to update,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6752)|
| 1:52:36| I-275 Access Road, we're in detail design on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6756)|
| 1:52:39| That's the road that will run from 5th Avenue to Barnard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6759)|
| 1:52:44| which will eventually connect 17th Street with Baxter Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6764)|
| 1:52:48| So we're really excited about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6768)|
| 1:52:51| We're in the process, therefore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6771)|
| 1:52:53| we're going to be moving into right-of-way acquisition here very closely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6773)|
| 1:52:55| We're getting those identified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6775)|
| 1:52:56| We're getting ready to get out and talk to the property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6776)|
| 1:52:58| So I think you might see construction on that within the next year, a request for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6778)|
| 1:53:02| So that's going well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6782)|
| 1:53:04| The adjacent property, the 10-acre site beside it, the Phillips Metal site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6784)|
| 1:53:07| we're still in conversations with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6787)|
| 1:53:10| It's a complicated site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6790)|
| 1:53:13| The Phillips Metal part is heavily polluted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6793)|
| 1:53:16| There are an EPA and TDEC regulatory requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6796)|
| 1:53:21| We have a lot of right-of-way in there, and the state of Tennessee has a lot of right-of-way there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6801)|
| 1:53:24| But it's a project that if we work together the next five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6804)|
| 1:53:27| we can continue to develop another great 10-acre in-city industrial site, we think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6807)|
| 1:53:31| We're hoping so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6811)|
| 1:53:33| The North Central Streetscapes project is still alive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6813)|
| 1:53:36| It's been slow getting out of the box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6816)|
| 1:53:38| And one thing that's happened is as we've pushed on Cumberland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6818)|
| 1:53:40| and pushed on a lot of the south waterfront stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6820)|
| 1:53:42| some of the north stuff has slowed down, but we're getting back into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6822)|
| 1:53:45| It also is in detail design, and that's the run from Depot Street out to Woodland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6825)|
| 1:53:49| We've painted it out on the street line already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6829)|
| 1:53:51| but we're going to have new curves, gutters, a lot of new stormwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6831)|
| 1:53:56| We got into this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6836)|
| 1:53:57| Here's another one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6837)|
| 1:53:58| The stormwater line on north central, not the stormwater, the water supply line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6838)|
| 1:54:03| was put out there in 1897.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6843)|
| 1:54:05| That's an 1897 water supply line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6845)|
| 1:54:07| So the second you start digging, it's going to just fall apart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6847)|
| 1:54:11| So the KUB is going to step in and help with that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6851)|
| 1:54:14| So that's going to start very soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6854)|
| 1:54:16| So downtown, or just generally development projects in general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6856)|
| 1:54:21| development is still strong in the downtown core area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6861)|
| 1:54:25| You're going to see a few more TIFs and pilots come out of me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6865)|
| 1:54:28| in the next couple of months as we go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6868)|
| 1:54:30| We've got a couple of exciting projects people are looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6870)|
| 1:54:35| I think the really exciting part of this is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6875)|
| 1:54:37| while one of those is a downtown project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6877)|
| 1:54:40| the others are kind of on the core, kind of down in the old city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6880)|
| 1:54:43| One's out on 6th Avenue on Washington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6883)|
| 1:54:46| Yeah, on 6th Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6886)|
| 1:54:49| And another one is on Vine Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6889)|
| 1:54:51| So we're starting to see moving around the edges in the French as we'd hoped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6891)|
| 1:54:55| We think that's a very exciting thing to see going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6895)|
| 1:54:58| So with that said, I'm going to turn it over to Don Michelle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6898)|
| 1:55:01| We're going to talk a little bit about what's going on on the South Waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6901)|
| 1:55:04| If you have any questions or anything I mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6904)|
| 1:55:07| we'll let it go to Don Michelle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6907)|
| 1:55:08| and then Rick will talk a little bit in detail about downtown stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6908)|
| 1:55:11| Good morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6911)|
| 1:55:12| Don Michelle Foster, Office of Redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6912)|
| 1:55:14| As you all know, we all want you to be patient with construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6914)|
| 1:55:17| that goes along within the South Waterfront as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6917)|
| 1:55:20| As you know, the demo work is continuing at the Baptist Hospital site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6920)|
| 1:55:23| which is a unique feature from the vision plan that was adopted in 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6923)|
| 1:55:28| This was one site that wasn't even part of that vision plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6928)|
| 1:55:31| except for expansion for the Baptist Hospital site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6931)|
| 1:55:33| That site is no longer there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6933)|
| 1:55:35| We are now removing an abandoned blighted property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6935)|
| 1:55:40| into a reuse for a new apartment complex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6940)|
| 1:55:43| that's going to be coupled with a public river walk and a public plaza.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6943)|
| 1:55:47| So that seems to be underway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6947)|
| 1:55:49| The developer is still in review for that component of the master plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6949)|
| 1:55:54| so he's coupling the apartment complex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6954)|
| 1:55:56| and going through a review with form-based code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6956)|
| 1:55:59| All that has to be one package| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6959)|
| 1:56:01| until we get the streetscape improvements identified through a traffic impact study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6961)|
| 1:56:05| and looking at the components of the river walk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6965)|
| 1:56:09| When all that's underway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6969)|
| 1:56:10| we'll have one complete package for that first phase of the apartment complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6970)|
| 1:56:16| So Blanchard-Calhoun Commercial hopes to have all that packaged by this summer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6976)|
| 1:56:20| and one of the things they're planning to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6980)|
| 1:56:23| is modify some of the public improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6983)|
| 1:56:25| The public plaza portion may be between the buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6985)|
| 1:56:28| and once they do modify that review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6988)|
| 1:56:30| we're hoping to get that back out to the neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6990)|
| 1:56:32| and give them an update on that site plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6992)|
| 1:56:36| Also, we met with the team for the student housing component,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6996)|
| 1:56:39| and they don't have any site plans for us to review just yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=6999)|
| 1:56:42| but we did introduce them to the form-based code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7002)|
| 1:56:44| and told them about the vision plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7004)|
| 1:56:46| and hopefully we'll get them on board and get them rolling pretty soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7006)|
| 1:56:50| As you know, back in 2012,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7010)|
| 1:56:54| the mayor announced public improvements for Sutree Landing Park and Waterfront Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7014)|
| 1:56:58| Those are underway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7018)|
| 1:56:59| We're happy to say that we do have a contract in place for the new park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7019)|
| 1:57:02| Waterfront Drive is continuing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7022)|
| 1:57:05| They're laying storm drains and doing great work out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7025)|
| 1:57:08| We had a pre-construction meeting yesterday with the two contractors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7028)|
| 1:57:11| to see how we can coordinate that work together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7031)|
| 1:57:14| and hopefully we can get a groundbreaking for that park schedule pretty soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7034)|
| 1:57:19| We'll be working with Parks and Rec and Kathleen Gibby and that office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7039)|
| 1:57:22| to coordinate that with you all for that groundbreaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7042)|
| 1:57:28| As far as River's Edge, it's underway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7048)|
| 1:57:31| One of the things in the regulating plan called for the realignment of Island Home Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7051)|
| 1:57:35| It's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7055)|
| 1:57:36| Also, a public river walk and a private development component of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7056)|
| 1:57:41| So, again, we ask for patience through the neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7061)|
| 1:57:45| We have been connecting with the neighborhoods through David Massey and his newsletter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7065)|
| 1:57:51| as well as our communications department and our traffic engineering department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7071)|
| 1:57:55| They were able to work out some tweaks with that first detour when it opened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7075)|
| 1:57:59| and hopefully we can prevent a lot of that truck, commercial truck traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7079)|
| 1:58:03| construction truck traffic that folks are seeing along Hillwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7083)|
| 1:58:07| We'll still keep working with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7087)|
| 1:58:09| We're working with KPD on enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7089)|
| 1:58:11| We're calling out, pulling out all the shots to make it safer for people to go through that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7091)|
| 1:58:16| while construction is underway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7096)|
| 1:58:19| Right now on River's Edge, they're going through storm drain placement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7099)|
| 1:58:25| and grading on the public street, which is going to be the access into the development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7105)|
| 1:58:30| and also coordinate with KUB on their utility placement as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7110)|
| 1:58:35| While that construction is underway, it may have a timeline where it will be coupled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7115)|
| 1:58:39| with the public river wall construction as well as the realignment of the public street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7119)|
| 1:58:45| So although we do have this closure, they had some delay with some soils| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7125)|
| 1:58:49| and also with some other issues with rain and weather that we can't control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7129)|
| 1:58:53| And so they may continue through that development while that road closure is going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7133)|
| 1:58:59| However, the project should be completed by next fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7139)|
| 1:59:04| Also, I wanted to add that we have some infill projects that are going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7144)|
| 1:59:08| with some existing structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7148)|
| 1:59:10| And thanks to our Plans, Review, and Inspections Department and Peter Ahrens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7150)|
| 1:59:13| we were grateful to go ahead and address issues that local developers have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7153)|
| 1:59:18| with existing structures along Sevier Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7158)|
| 1:59:21| We added some language to the form-based code to address additions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7161)|
| 1:59:26| renovations, and repairs for existing structures to kind of help them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7166)|
| 1:59:29| to make a more feasible outcome and also be more practical about how those issues occur| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7169)|
| 1:59:35| when we're working with existing conditions and still having issues with form-based code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7175)|
| 1:59:40| that only looks at new construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7180)|
| 1:59:42| So we had to kind of go back through and alter that and amend that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7182)|
| 1:59:46| So I think we're underway with getting all that done there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7186)|
| 1:59:52| Thank you, Donna Michelle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7192)|
| 1:59:53| You're doing a great job over there working with folks getting these projects moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7193)|
| 1:59:56| So if y'all don't have any questions for us, I think it's time to ask myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7196)|
| 2:00:00| or Donna Michelle right now, if not, we'll put Rick on the podium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7200)|
| 2:00:03| and let him talk to you about all that's going on in downtown Cora.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7203)|
| 2:00:06| Councilman Delpo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7206)|
| 2:00:07| Yeah, could you just comment on the timeline for the Magnolia Corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7207)|
| 2:00:10| upgrade that four-block demonstration area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7210)|
| 2:00:13| Right now we're wrapping up a discussion on scope of services with our design consultant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7213)|
| 2:00:17| They're going to go through and produce a final design for that whole model block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7217)|
| 2:00:21| And from there we're asking them, and this is teaming with Tom Clabo's office and engineer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7221)|
| 2:00:27| we're asking them to divide that project out into construction phases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7227)|
| 2:00:32| from Jasmine to Winona and then Winona to Bertrand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7232)|
| 2:00:36| So this year's budget, we're probably going to be completing those final designs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7236)|
| 2:00:40| and looking at right-of-way services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7240)|
| 2:00:43| So no dirt moving until?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7243)|
| 2:00:44| No dirt moving until the final design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7244)|
| 2:00:46| We hope to get the renderings back out to the public by the end of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7246)|
| 2:00:49| We want to take that back out to them and let them know what that's going to look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7249)|
| 2:00:53| We want to update those renderings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7253)|
| 2:00:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7254)|
| 2:00:58| Thank you, Mary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7258)|
| 2:00:59| I just want you to, I guess, say when we expect to have the new person on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7259)|
| 2:01:03| and what area they'll be covering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7263)|
| 2:01:07| Are they going to be covering north and east or has that been determined?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7267)|
| 2:01:12| That has yet to be determined as to what the exact focus will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7272)|
| 2:01:16| When I leave there will be obviously new leadership there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7276)|
| 2:01:18| and then there will be that new position to fill with, so that will be somebody else's issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7278)|
| 2:01:26| I guess it's a plan not to fill that position until the new director is put in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7286)|
| 2:01:30| I think it's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7290)|
| 2:01:31| Okay, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7291)|
| 2:01:35| Mr. Emmett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7295)|
| 2:01:42| Good morning, Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7302)|
| 2:01:43| I'm Rick Emmett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7303)|
| 2:01:44| I'm the downtown coordinator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7304)|
| 2:01:45| I guess my role is anything to do with downtown, I touch pretty much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7305)|
| 2:01:49| It's kind of a catch-all position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7309)|
| 2:01:51| Somebody mentioned 311.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7311)|
| 2:01:53| It kind of works out that if 311 doesn't know who else to call, they call me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7313)|
| 2:01:58| whether it's downtown or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7318)|
| 2:02:00| I do some annexation things on the side too and some other census issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7320)|
| 2:02:04| but basically downtown is the primary focus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7324)|
| 2:02:07| Lots going on downtown, as you all know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7327)|
| 2:02:10| A comment made about Walnut Street a minute ago and all these road closures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7330)|
| 2:02:14| they're all connected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7334)|
| 2:02:16| I mean, Cumberland Avenue closure is connected to downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7336)|
| 2:02:18| When Walnut was closed, we had people detouring around Neyland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7338)|
| 2:02:21| where they couldn't get to town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7341)|
| 2:02:23| So it takes quite a lot of coordination for all of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7343)|
| 2:02:26| and Christy's team is great to work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7346)|
| 2:02:28| Operations backs me 1,000%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7348)|
| 2:02:32| and I really enjoy everything, all the support I get from those folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7352)|
| 2:02:36| We have garbage collection downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7356)|
| 2:02:38| We have security issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7358)|
| 2:02:39| We have parking issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7359)|
| 2:02:41| I probably talk about parking at least an hour every day with somebody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7361)|
| 2:02:45| between the parking garages to parking spaces to parking enforcement to meters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7365)|
| 2:02:49| to signals, all those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7369)|
| 2:02:52| And, again, engineering is great to work with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7372)|
| 2:02:54| and very responsive to everything we have going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7374)|
| 2:02:58| Just a little bit of update on some of the projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7378)|
| 2:03:01| Our downtown restroom is underway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7381)|
| 2:03:03| We've got the consultant under contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7383)|
| 2:03:06| hoping to get a design here in the next few weeks from those guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7386)|
| 2:03:10| Had a pre-meeting early on with Stephanie Cook and engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7390)|
| 2:03:13| and Jane Burr at a PBA to try to make sure that we all, on the front end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7393)|
| 2:03:17| know exactly what we're getting into there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7397)|
| 2:03:19| Jane already manages two restrooms for us at Volunteer Landing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7399)|
| 2:03:23| and at the World's Fair Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7403)|
| 2:03:25| so she's got a lot of experience in issues with those restaurants and fixtures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7405)|
| 2:03:30| and those kinds of restrooms and those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7410)|
| 2:03:33| So she's giving input, and, of course, Stephanie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7413)|
| 2:03:36| as far as our ADA issues have to be addressed there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7416)|
| 2:03:40| That's going to be a Market Square garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7420)|
| 2:03:42| I think all of you all know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7422)|
| 2:03:44| Other things going on, the promenade roof is about repaired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7424)|
| 2:03:48| We've been working on that or talking about that for a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7428)|
| 2:03:51| but that's been a pretty big project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7431)|
| 2:03:53| A lot of flooding in Phoenix Building and other buildings downtown for years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7433)|
| 2:03:57| and I think that's going to be wrapped up here in the next few weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7437)|
| 2:04:00| It looks really good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7440)|
| 2:04:01| If you look over from James Watt Parkway, you can now see the backs of those buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7441)|
| 2:04:04| and I think it's going to be a huge improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7444)|
| 2:04:06| The promenade deck is going to be worked on as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7446)|
| 2:04:10| We don't have the final design there yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7450)|
| 2:04:14| Looking ahead, we've got four huge streetscape projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7454)|
| 2:04:17| that are going to be occurring downtown probably this early this summer and this fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7457)|
| 2:04:22| The 700 block of South Gay Street is going to be under construction probably around July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7462)|
| 2:04:27| It will be an engineering project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7467)|
| 2:04:28| and I'm sure Jim Hagerman will talk more about that when he gets here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7468)|
| 2:04:31| but that's the block between Church and Cumberland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7471)|
| 2:04:36| Pretty big project, utility upgrades, new street trees, sidewalk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7476)|
| 2:04:42| silver cells to make the trees healthier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7482)|
| 2:04:45| Also, Marble Alley is underway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7485)|
| 2:04:47| We're hoping to issue a notice to proceed here in the next few weeks there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7487)|
| 2:04:52| Of course, Marble Alley is looking fantastic if you look over that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7492)|
| 2:04:56| That whole end of town is really being developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7496)|
| 2:04:58| That's State Street, Commerce, and Central.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7498)|
| 2:05:01| And then moving over to Jackson, the entire Jackson Avenue corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7501)|
| 2:05:04| pretty much is going to be under development here very soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7504)|
| 2:05:07| Each end of the ramps is under development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7507)|
| 2:05:11| The Old City portion of that should start, I hope, this fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7511)|
| 2:05:15| That's from the ramps going to Central.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7515)|
| 2:05:18| And, again, the disinvestment to investment, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7518)|
| 2:05:22| where John Daniels is being redeveloped there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7522)|
| 2:05:24| and some other folks are doing some projects in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7524)|
| 2:05:27| So we're thinking that's going to be a good enhancement for that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7527)|
| 2:05:32| We've got a sidewalk project from the ramps going west all the way to the foundry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7532)|
| 2:05:38| crossing Henley Street there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7538)|
| 2:05:40| We're in land acquisition and trying to get to some detailed work there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7540)|
| 2:05:44| But hoping we can get that underway by this fall as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7544)|
| 2:05:47| So those are four pretty big projects for downtown as far as streetscape projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7547)|
| 2:05:53| And that, as you all know, requires a lot of communication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7553)|
| 2:05:57| We've spent a lot of legwork going door to door and talking to property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7557)|
| 2:06:00| and talking to everybody that we can about how life exists there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7560)|
| 2:06:06| I mean, what do you all do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7566)|
| 2:06:07| What do you need from us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7567)|
| 2:06:09| What's your delivery schedule?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7569)|
| 2:06:11| How many residents do you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7571)|
| 2:06:13| All those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7573)|
| 2:06:14| It's really good to know on the front end so we can tell the contractors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7574)|
| 2:06:17| and get ahead of the game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7577)|
| 2:06:18| That's the lesson learned from the 100 Block, frankly, from years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7578)|
| 2:06:22| And communication will be key too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7582)|
| 2:06:24| Jesse talked about the communication end, and he and Eric are great there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7584)|
| 2:06:28| We may end up having a blog, as I did on the 100 Block, for all these projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7588)|
| 2:06:31| That might be a smart thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7591)|
| 2:06:33| We can kind of target audiences that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7593)|
| 2:06:35| I can send out blog posts to the 300 or 400 people I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7595)|
| 2:06:38| are really intensely impacted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7598)|
| 2:06:41| and then those get out to other folks that way too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7601)|
| 2:06:45| I guess I'll take some questions if anybody has any questions about downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7605)|
| 2:06:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7611)|
| 2:06:52| I'm just curious, on the intersection paving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7612)|
| 2:06:57| are we getting away from the bricks that crack and fall and move?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7617)|
| 2:07:01| Are we going to do something like pressed concrete or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7621)|
| 2:07:04| Exactly, Nick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7624)|
| 2:07:05| That's exactly what we're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7625)|
| 2:07:06| It's part of the 700 Block project at Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7626)|
| 2:07:09| I think it's going to be Clinch, Cumberland, Church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7629)|
| 2:07:13| and we're going to add another one at Cumberland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7633)|
| 2:07:15| It's going to be stamped, pressed asphalt or concrete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7635)|
| 2:07:17| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7637)|
| 2:07:18| That other stuff looks good, but it fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7638)|
| 2:07:20| Exactly, and that's what we did in the old city many years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7640)|
| 2:07:22| and that's the same pattern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7642)|
| 2:07:24| If you look when you walk up the city county building here across Main Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7644)|
| 2:07:27| that will be the same sort of look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7647)|
| 2:07:29| So I think that's going to be much, much better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7649)|
| 2:07:31| I know Finbar calls me occasionally about some bricks missing there too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7651)|
| 2:07:34| and that's been a challenge for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7654)|
| 2:07:36| That brick, although it looks good, it's been a challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7656)|
| 2:07:39| Second question was are you now totally out of the garage business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7659)|
| 2:07:43| I guess you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7663)|
| 2:07:44| Well, that's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7664)|
| 2:07:46| The garage operations and garage maintenance and security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7666)|
| 2:07:49| The building part you're done, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7669)|
| 2:07:51| Well, the building part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7671)|
| 2:07:52| the lower levels of the State Street Garage is about to be wrapped up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7672)|
| 2:07:55| We're going to have 60 parking spaces there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7675)|
| 2:07:57| So, yes, for now we are pretty much out of the parking garage building phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7677)|
| 2:08:03| We're trying to work with the new Walnut Street Garage, some of their operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7683)|
| 2:08:06| They're kind of new to the getting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7686)|
| 2:08:08| Yeah, they're just brand new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7688)|
| 2:08:09| Yeah, just had a soft opening a week or two ago and lots of challenges there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7689)|
| 2:08:12| and I've had a lot of conversation this week with them about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7692)|
| 2:08:15| And we're going to make sure they do the right thing for the taxpayers there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7695)|
| 2:08:20| Well, thank you much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7700)|
| 2:08:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7703)|
| 2:08:24| Other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7704)|
| 2:08:25| If not, Ms. Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7705)|
| 2:08:27| So these last two speakers are on page two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7707)|
| 2:08:31| Their budget is on page two at the very top of the two orgs at the top of the page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7711)|
| 2:08:37| Good morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7717)|
| 2:08:38| Erin Gill, Director of the Office of Sustainability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7718)|
| 2:08:41| I know you all are well aware of our mission, which is to make Knoxville a more sustainable city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7721)|
| 2:08:47| And by that we mean one where the economy, the environment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7727)|
| 2:08:50| and the community can all thrive simultaneously now and in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7730)|
| 2:08:54| So just to sort of recap some highlights from what we do and where we're heading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7734)|
| 2:08:59| one of our core missions is to make city operations leaner and greener,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7739)|
| 2:09:03| so saving taxpayer dollars while we're performing all the critical operations that we have here at the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7743)|
| 2:09:10| And I really just want to recognize here that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7750)|
| 2:09:13| a lot of our leadership in sustainability has been because departments have incorporated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7753)|
| 2:09:18| sustainability into their operations so effectively over the last few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7758)|
| 2:09:21| So my office continues to help those departments push the envelope to identify the emerging best practices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7761)|
| 2:09:28| best technologies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7768)|
| 2:09:29| We heard about electric vehicles earlier this morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7769)|
| 2:09:31| so examples of where operations can be more efficient and building on the momentum we've already had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7771)|
| 2:09:37| We also solve or serve a role in those projects that maybe don't have a good owner in an existing department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7777)|
| 2:09:44| So, for instance, the Jacob Building solar project that we put at Chilhowee Park earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7784)|
| 2:09:50| well, I guess it was October of last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7790)|
| 2:09:52| That was a great success, a great public-private partnership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7792)|
| 2:09:55| that the Office of Sustainability led the contracting process on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7795)|
| 2:09:58| and we're leading the contracting process for a similar solar project at the Public Works Complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7798)|
| 2:10:03| So we try to fill that role of an office need where another department maybe doesn't have the staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7803)|
| 2:10:09| or capacity or knowledge or expertise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7809)|
| 2:10:11| So we very much appreciate our role there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7811)|
| 2:10:14| And then we also are, I think, aside from Jim, the only office that sees 100% of our utility bills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7814)|
| 2:10:20| So we track those extremely closely, and after taking over the Amoresco contract last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7820)|
| 2:10:26| are becoming much more active in working hand-in-hand with our facilities folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7826)|
| 2:10:30| to identify where we may be seeing some increases in energy consumption that we can curb back down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7830)|
| 2:10:39| making sure that we're leveraging the full capacity of the improvements that we put in through Amoresco several years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7839)|
| 2:10:45| So we, again, have taken over that contract, and we'll be continuing to do that in the upcoming year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7845)|
| 2:10:50| to really make sure we're maximizing our operational efficiency when it comes to our utility usage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7850)|
| 2:10:54| so we're not literally putting taxpayer dollars out the window.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7854)|
| 2:10:58| And then I know you guys have asked in the past about streetlights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7858)|
| 2:11:02| and that is one of the great projects that we're going to be tackling in the upcoming year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7862)|
| 2:11:06| We've had some great conversations already with KUB about how that can be financially viable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7866)|
| 2:11:12| and so we'll be continuing to push that conversation forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7872)|
| 2:11:14| and ideally coming up with a financially both prudent as well as successful savings from streetlights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7874)|
| 2:11:23| and converting them to LEDs versus the high-pressure sodiums that we tend to have now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7883)|
| 2:11:28| So we're very excited about moving that project forward in this next fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7888)|
| 2:11:32| And then the other big piece of what we do, aside from the operational efficiency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7892)|
| 2:11:36| is promoting the policies and programs that help our community embrace sustainability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7896)|
| 2:11:42| So some of those things are the institutionalization of the Complete Streets Ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7902)|
| 2:11:46| which we were the lead department to bring that to you last fall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7906)|
| 2:11:50| to institutionalize our commitment to complete streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7910)|
| 2:11:53| We've also been leading the Urban Agriculture Zoning Ordinance changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7913)|
| 2:11:57| so we've seen so much interest in local urban agriculture and urban food,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7917)|
| 2:12:00| so our office has just taken that to MPC actually last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7920)|
| 2:12:04| and we'll be coming to you with those improvements to the zoning code to facilitate urban agriculture in June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7924)|
| 2:12:09| So we're excited about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7929)|
| 2:12:12| And then within that community piece, the other really major project that we've been leading over the last two years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7932)|
| 2:12:17| has been the Smarter Cities Partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7937)|
| 2:12:19| So if you remember, 2013, IBM came in and gave us a great set of recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7939)|
| 2:12:23| about how the city and our partners could take a much more strategic approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7943)|
| 2:12:29| toward assisting struggling families with their utility bills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7949)|
| 2:12:33| not simply by helping them pay the bill in the short term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7953)|
| 2:12:36| but investing in the long-term solution of energy efficiency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7956)|
| 2:12:39| which has the co-benefits of improving your housing stock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7959)|
| 2:12:42| and making homes more comfortable and affordable overall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7962)|
| 2:12:45| So that project I'm proud to announce really, or not really announce,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7965)|
| 2:12:49| but highlight has been moving forward really well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7969)|
| 2:12:53| Since IBM gave us those recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7973)|
| 2:12:55| I say we've checked several major boxes in terms of the recommendations that they posed to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7975)|
| 2:12:59| So a couple highlights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7979)|
| 2:13:01| We had a $60,000 grant that we received last fall to move forward with education initiatives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7981)|
| 2:13:06| so we'll be rolling out an education campaign in coordination with several partners this fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7986)|
| 2:13:11| And then we also, of course, had the great news that TVA has awarded us over $7 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7991)|
| 2:13:16| to the Knoxville community for energy efficiency retrofits at low-income homes in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=7996)|
| 2:13:21| So that's tremendous,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8001)|
| 2:13:23| and I think it really speaks to the leadership in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8003)|
| 2:13:26| and the vision that this city council and the administration have pushed forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8006)|
| 2:13:31| in terms of coordinated, aligned resources around sustainability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8011)|
| 2:13:35| So we're very proud of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8015)|
| 2:13:37| So as we go into next fiscal year, obviously we want to continue that progress| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8017)|
| 2:13:40| and continue to work very meaningfully with our partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8020)|
| 2:13:43| That's why the one increase in our budget, or the big increase in our budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8023)|
| 2:13:47| is an AmeriCorps position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8027)|
| 2:13:49| As I think spoken to, the impact that the AmeriCorps representatives can have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8029)|
| 2:13:53| on just helping small departments like sustainability increase their capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8033)|
| 2:13:58| So we would appreciate your support in supporting that position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8038)|
| 2:14:01| as it will allow us to engage more meaningfully with our partners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8041)|
| 2:14:05| particularly around urban agriculture, the Food Policy Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8045)|
| 2:14:08| as well as all the Smarter Cities partners that we've engaged through the IBM project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8048)|
| 2:14:13| So we're very excited about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8053)|
| 2:14:15| And then, again, just as we think about the Office of Sustainability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8055)|
| 2:14:18| we're here to try to help keep Knoxville prepared, competitive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8058)|
| 2:14:22| and attractive to both residents and businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8062)|
| 2:14:25| thinking about overall quality of life and meeting the needs of a 21st century city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8065)|
| 2:14:31| So I'll be happy to hopefully take any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8071)|
| 2:14:35| Awesome. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8075)|
| 2:14:38| Yeah, just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8078)|
| 2:14:40| Our notes here show that, I guess, in taking over Ameresco,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8080)|
| 2:14:43| there's a payment of $94,700 or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8083)|
| 2:14:47| Tell us briefly, do they get paid more if they achieve greater efficiencies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8087)|
| 2:14:53| How does it work, the bonus process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8093)|
| 2:14:55| It's been several years, and it might be good refreshing our recollection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8095)|
| 2:14:59| Sure. Well, it's not a bonus process, so I'll say that first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8099)|
| 2:15:02| Performance process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8102)|
| 2:15:04| Sure. The small escalation is essentially based on a CPI adjustment that's in the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8104)|
| 2:15:09| So per the existing contract that we signed back in 2009, I think it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8109)|
| 2:15:14| essentially the ongoing payment is for operations and maintenance of several pieces of equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8114)|
| 2:15:20| For instance, pool covers break down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8120)|
| 2:15:22| The chlorine breaks them down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8122)|
| 2:15:24| This contract covers the replacement of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8124)|
| 2:15:27| They also continue to assist us with software, making sure that our software stays upgraded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8127)|
| 2:15:32| so they will push out software upgrades like we get on our phones to the software system that we invested in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8132)|
| 2:15:40| The other component of that, however, is measurement and verification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8140)|
| 2:15:43| So this is an important component in which it allows us to see that the savings that they told us that we would get are, in fact, happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8143)|
| 2:15:51| So they come in, they look at the buildings, all buildings over the course of a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8151)|
| 2:15:55| They visit each one, both remotely and on site, to essentially say, hey, are our temperature set points where the contract said they would be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8155)|
| 2:16:04| And then they come back to us and talk through maybe what's not quite on par.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8164)|
| 2:16:09| And so then we have just a much more increased ability to then work with our facilities folks to make sure that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8169)|
| 2:16:14| Some of their payments are tied to the performance of those buildings, is it not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8174)|
| 2:16:17| Not the 90,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8177)|
| 2:16:18| So the 90,000, essentially, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8178)|
| 2:16:20| It would allow us to identify should there be any major issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8180)|
| 2:16:25| So without that measurement and verification process, we wouldn't necessarily know that there's a gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8185)|
| 2:16:30| The second question is with regard to IBM and the Smarter Cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8190)|
| 2:16:34| do they come back as sort of a revisit loop and look at how you're doing or make update suggestions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8194)|
| 2:16:39| How does that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8199)|
| 2:16:40| Well, we are getting some great communications with IBM because I think of the Smarter Cities were one that's really taken action,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8200)|
| 2:16:47| bold action on the recommendations that they've given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8207)|
| 2:16:49| So it's not part of that grant that they would come back, but we continue to stay in touch with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8209)|
| 2:16:53| And they've actually been able to help just amplify the great press that we've had recently related to the TVA award,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8213)|
| 2:17:00| as well as partnership places, the $60,000 education grant that we got last fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8220)|
| 2:17:05| So it's not part of our contract that they would come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8225)|
| 2:17:07| I think that they want to help continue the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8227)|
| 2:17:11| They've presented us with a few other more smaller technical assistance things around social media| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8231)|
| 2:17:15| and things like that we can consider taking advantage of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8235)|
| 2:17:18| You're staying in touch was the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8238)|
| 2:17:19| We're staying in touch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8239)|
| 2:17:20| And they are impressed and I think really excited to see the progress that we've made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8240)|
| 2:17:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8245)|
| 2:17:26| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8246)|
| 2:17:27| Yes, there is a community organization, SEED, socially, environmentally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8247)|
| 2:17:32| Socially Equal Economic Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8252)|
| 2:17:34| Does that organization work with your office in some way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8254)|
| 2:17:39| How does that work if you don't mind?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8259)|
| 2:17:42| Yeah, so SEED I would consider one of our greatest partners in the Smarter Cities partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8262)|
| 2:17:46| And I say that because they have such a good ear to the ground in terms of the needs of many of our residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8266)|
| 2:17:53| especially in those older neighborhoods where infrastructure is aging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8273)|
| 2:17:56| They've also been thinking for I think about six years, seven years now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8276)|
| 2:18:00| about how you can use energy efficiency not just to have the environmental benefits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8280)|
| 2:18:06| but also as an economic development benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8286)|
| 2:18:08| So they are very much part of the Smarter Cities Partnership Stakeholder Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8288)|
| 2:18:13| They serve on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8293)|
| 2:18:14| And then they've also been one of our most engaged partners in all of the work groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8294)|
| 2:18:17| and all of the different actions that come about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8297)|
| 2:18:19| So they were helpful in, for instance, hosting several focus groups this last spring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8299)|
| 2:18:23| so that we could hear directly from residents about what types of education initiatives might work best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8303)|
| 2:18:28| So we continue to be impressed by their work and enjoy working with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8308)|
| 2:18:32| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8312)|
| 2:18:34| But you've not, we've not, we're not, we've decreased funding for them in the community grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8314)|
| 2:18:41| I haven't, I can't speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8321)|
| 2:18:43| But I will say that they're a partner to us and we've appreciated their participation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8323)|
| 2:18:48| Last year they had 4,000 in community grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8328)|
| 2:18:52| Do you know why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8332)|
| 2:18:53| I guess one of you all want to speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8333)|
| 2:18:56| Really, that's just the mayor's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8336)|
| 2:18:58| So you probably need to ask her directly, Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8338)|
| 2:19:07| Further questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8347)|
| 2:19:09| Seeing no more, we're going to take a five-minute break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8349)|
| 2:19:13| I think we're losing our crowd here, our group, quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8353)|
| 2:19:18| So I think we're a little bit ahead of schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8358)|
| 2:19:20| So we'll be back here in five or so minutes, if you could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8360)|
| 2:19:26| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8366)|
| 2:19:27| Since you plied us with liquid, it would be a good time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8367)|
| 2:19:29| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8369)|
| 2:19:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8390)|

| 2:26:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8798)|
| 2:26:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8799)|
| 2:26:56| A couple of updates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8816)|
| 2:26:57| One has to do with the mobile food vendor program that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8817)|
| 2:27:02| allowed us to offer, the pilot program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8822)|
| 2:27:05| is May, that we permitted our very first food truck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8825)|
| 2:27:09| And now we have 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8829)|
| 2:27:11| And I'm working with about four more that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8831)|
| 2:27:13| are coming under the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8833)|
| 2:27:16| It is going really well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8836)|
| 2:27:18| We are very happy to have 18 food trucks that we know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8838)|
| 2:27:22| are environmentally safe and safe for the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8842)|
| 2:27:27| They are equipped with grease traps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8847)|
| 2:27:30| They follow a grease control program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8850)|
| 2:27:33| They have their health permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8853)|
| 2:27:35| They have fire suppression system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8855)|
| 2:27:37| and electrical requirements and the insurance requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8857)|
| 2:27:41| that the city of Knoxville has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8861)|
| 2:27:44| And so we are evaluating that program right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8864)|
| 2:27:48| But we hope to come to you to adopt it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8868)|
| 2:27:53| as permanent policy in terms of the requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8873)|
| 2:27:56| because I think it is an important thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8876)|
| 2:27:59| to have the safe food trucks out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8879)|
| 2:28:01| It's an industry that continues to grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8881)|
| 2:28:04| I get calls on a daily basis from people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8884)|
| 2:28:06| wanting to have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8886)|
| 2:28:08| And so it's the first time that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8888)|
| 2:28:10| have standardized all those requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8890)|
| 2:28:14| not just from the city end, but also from KUB and the health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8894)|
| 2:28:19| department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8899)|
| 2:28:20| And the other thing that I wanted to update you about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8900)|
| 2:28:23| was our business advisory council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8903)|
| 2:28:25| because soon you will, at council meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8905)|
| 2:28:30| you will see 12 new members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8910)|
| 2:28:33| And so that might take you back a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8913)|
| 2:28:35| We're doing away with a staggering enrollment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8915)|
| 2:28:39| for that business advisory council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8919)|
| 2:28:41| and we're doing a two-year service for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8921)|
| 2:28:45| It has worked out really well in that we meet with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8925)|
| 2:28:50| A couple of directors present at the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8930)|
| 2:28:56| and they have an opportunity to ask questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8936)|
| 2:28:59| about that particular department, learn about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8939)|
| 2:29:03| and get feedback as to how their businesses interacted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8943)|
| 2:29:07| with that department and any suggestions they may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8947)|
| 2:29:12| And it's also beyond city of Knoxville and departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8952)|
| 2:29:15| We also involve the Knoxville Chamber, Innovation Valley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8955)|
| 2:29:19| the Tennessee Small Business Development Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8959)|
| 2:29:22| the Knoxville Entrepreneur Center, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8962)|
| 2:29:25| So it has worked out really well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8965)|
| 2:29:28| And I continue to help businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8968)|
| 2:29:31| in whatever capacity I can as they reach to me with issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8971)|
| 2:29:36| challenges, questions, or wanting to start up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8976)|
| 2:29:39| and helping them with whatever resources we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8979)|
| 2:29:46| I'll be happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8986)|
| 2:29:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8989)|
| 2:29:50| And just to turn you over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8990)|
| 2:29:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8992)|
| 2:29:54| Yeah, Patricia, have you had any feedback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8994)|
| 2:29:57| from the brick-and-mortar restaurants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8997)|
| 2:29:59| about the food trucks in terms of either resentment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=8999)|
| 2:30:02| interference, help, hurt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9002)|
| 2:30:04| I mean, just what's the reading on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9004)|
| 2:30:08| It's a good question, because there was so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9008)|
| 2:30:12| At the beginning when we announced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9012)|
| 2:30:13| we were going to do the pilot program, there was a pushback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9013)|
| 2:30:16| It was real new, and no one knew what to expect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9016)|
| 2:30:18| Have not heard one complain from a brick-and-mortar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9018)|
| 2:30:21| So it really, I think it has worked really well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9021)|
| 2:30:26| Some of the issues have been more on the public's zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9026)|
| 2:30:31| the mobile food vending zones downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9031)|
| 2:30:34| Right, so some of them are being used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9034)|
| 2:30:36| Some of them are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9036)|
| 2:30:37| And so we will, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9037)|
| 2:30:40| I was going to say, one of the reasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9040)|
| 2:30:42| Patricia's not taking enough credit that we haven't heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9042)|
| 2:30:45| complaints is she brought them in in a big way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9045)|
| 2:30:48| when we were doing all the policy discussions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9048)|
| 2:30:50| and having the meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9050)|
| 2:30:51| So they were at the table and helped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9051)|
| 2:30:53| make some suggestions that were, in fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9053)|
| 2:30:55| So they bought into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9055)|
| 2:30:56| Yes, they basically bought into it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9056)|
| 2:30:58| and saw the program as being a positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9058)|
| 2:31:00| And as she said, we've heard zero complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9060)|
| 2:31:02| But that's mainly because she was so effective in pulling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9062)|
| 2:31:04| everybody together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9064)|
| 2:31:06| Do you expect over time that one or more of those businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9066)|
| 2:31:10| will, that our food trucks will become full-fledged restaurants?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9070)|
| 2:31:14| I mean, is that a trial ground?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9074)|
| 2:31:16| Yeah, so we now have one that has two food trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9076)|
| 2:31:21| And yeah, there are some that are considering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9081)|
| 2:31:25| having the brick-and-mortar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9085)|
| 2:31:27| And then we're hearing people wanting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9087)|
| 2:31:29| to do a brick-and-mortar food truck| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9089)|
| 2:31:33| park, where there will be maybe a commissary kitchen for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9093)|
| 2:31:37| and where they can park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9097)|
| 2:31:38| So there's all kinds of ideas floating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9098)|
| 2:31:41| around that business model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9101)|
| 2:31:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9104)|
| 2:31:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9105)|
| 2:31:47| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9107)|
| 2:31:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9109)|
| 2:31:49| What are the regulations about the food trucks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9109)|
| 2:31:53| being in other parts of the city in terms of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9113)|
| 2:31:55| are they required to have a permit to be anywhere?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9115)|
| 2:31:59| They are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9119)|
| 2:32:00| So that's when we'll come to you for permanent policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9120)|
| 2:32:04| to adopt those requirements, not just under the pilot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9124)|
| 2:32:07| but as permanent policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9127)|
| 2:32:09| It'll make it easier for us to then enforce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9129)|
| 2:32:13| what trucks are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9133)|
| 2:32:14| So the food trucks are allowed to park outside those food| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9134)|
| 2:32:19| truck zones downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9139)|
| 2:32:21| They're allowed to park in private parking lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9141)|
| 2:32:25| in commercial zones, with permission of the owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9145)|
| 2:32:29| But they should have all these requirements that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9149)|
| 2:32:33| We know that there are trucks out there that have not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9153)|
| 2:32:36| come under the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9156)|
| 2:32:38| And adopting that permanent policy of those requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part1?start=9158)|
