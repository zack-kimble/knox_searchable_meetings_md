| 0:00:00| I'm going to go ahead and call this public hearing for our budget to begin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=0)|
| 0:00:10| And if all the commissioners would find their seats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=10)|
| 0:00:16| And I'm going to ask that Finance Director John Troyer, if you'll lead us in the pledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=16)|
| 0:00:24| Mr. Chairman, I'd be glad to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=24)|
| 0:00:29| Salute and pledge. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=29)|
| 0:00:36| and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=36)|
| 0:00:52| Okay, we're already running behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=52)|
| 0:00:55| We had a little trouble with our recording device, but we're going to try to catch back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=55)|
| 0:01:02| Before I get started, do any commissioners have any questions about how this day is going to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=62)|
| 0:01:11| I thought Amy was taking care of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=71)|
| 0:01:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=75)|
| 0:01:16| First up, Lynn Littington, Air Quality Management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=76)|
| 0:01:20| Good morning, commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=80)|
| 0:01:22| I don't know if this is a good thing or a bad thing that I'm up here first, but it depends on what you have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=82)|
| 0:01:29| Basically, as you know, we've got a continuation budget, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=89)|
| 0:01:36| Our budget is composed of different components.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=96)|
| 0:01:41| A large majority of it is federal grants, which is a match for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=101)|
| 0:01:49| Another big component of it is permit fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=109)|
| 0:01:53| The Clean Air Act 1990 amendments stated that industry facilities that were polluting the air would pay for that pollution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=113)|
| 0:02:04| They assessed a certain dollar amount per ton of air pollutants that they put into the air.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=124)|
| 0:02:11| So that's where a large part of our fee budgets or our income is coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=131)|
| 0:02:20| With industry shutting down throughout Knox County and actually all over, that has hurt us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=140)|
| 0:02:29| Every time we lose an industry, we're losing their permit fees, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=149)|
| 0:02:33| So we don't like to see that either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=153)|
| 0:02:35| You know, we want a good economy here, and we have a vested interest in it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=155)|
| 0:02:42| But we're managing with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=162)|
| 0:02:44| We just keep juggling things around to meet the needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=164)|
| 0:02:51| We do have, it won't be before you this month, but coming in next month is our Memorandum of Understanding with IM's Nature Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=171)|
| 0:03:03| We do give them a sizable amount of money each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=183)|
| 0:03:07| They take care of all of our education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=187)|
| 0:03:10| We are required by the federal government to be educating on air quality and environmental issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=190)|
| 0:03:17| and we find it much cheaper to do this through IM's Nature Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=197)|
| 0:03:23| We do have before you this month, we'll be talking next week, about a retrofit grant that we just received from EPA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=203)|
| 0:03:30| to help our Knox County Service Center retrofit all of the diesel vehicles to cut down on the particulates that are coming out of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=210)|
| 0:03:43| The only other thing that I wanted to comment on this morning is drive-home vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=223)|
| 0:03:48| There was something in the paper last week that we had a drive-home vehicle for our inspector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=228)|
| 0:03:54| We have no drive-home vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=234)|
| 0:03:56| We've not had any for, well, I had one until around early 2000s that I received as the director of the agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=236)|
| 0:04:08| That was something that went way back to Dwight Castle that all of the directors received take-home vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=248)|
| 0:04:16| Mr. Jones asked that I turn that in some time ago because all that was being used for was commuting back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=256)|
| 0:04:25| We've got nine or ten vehicles in our fleet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=265)|
| 0:04:29| They're all used just during the day by our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=269)|
| 0:04:32| So I just wanted to clear the air on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=272)|
| 0:04:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=277)|
| 0:04:38| Do we have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=278)|
| 0:04:40| Commissioner Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=280)|
| 0:04:41| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=281)|
| 0:04:42| I was just going to ask what, I guess, business model you use because we're looking at that about the drive-home vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=282)|
| 0:04:48| Do you pool them and the people just request to take them from the pool?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=288)|
| 0:04:52| Are they assigned to individuals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=292)|
| 0:04:55| I mean, just for our information about what we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=295)|
| 0:04:58| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=298)|
| 0:04:59| We have our own, say, fleet of vehicles that are assigned to our department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=299)|
| 0:05:07| I have them assigned really to two people per vehicle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=307)|
| 0:05:12| and they're responsible for making sure that they are gassed up, that they receive all of their servicing that they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=312)|
| 0:05:20| And then I review that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=320)|
| 0:05:21| I get that report every month from the service center, and I review that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=321)|
| 0:05:25| I've got it in a computer spreadsheet where I can sit there and track their mileage, their vehicle costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=325)|
| 0:05:32| Most of mine are pretty old vehicles, so I'm looking at when I need to retire them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=332)|
| 0:05:37| I haven't bought a new one, oh, gosh, I guess since 2003.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=337)|
| 0:05:41| We just run them until the wheels fall off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=341)|
| 0:05:43| Do they stay in this building or a central location?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=343)|
| 0:05:48| Actually, our air lab is behind the service center, and we've got a compound over there, and they stay over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=348)|
| 0:05:55| So when our people, some of our staff offices are over there at that air lab,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=355)|
| 0:06:01| the rest of them are parked at the staff is at the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=361)|
| 0:06:06| When they need the vehicle, they take their personal car, drive over there, pick it up, use it during the day, and then switch back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=366)|
| 0:06:14| Are you ever in a situation after normal business hours where an employee needs to do county work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=374)|
| 0:06:23| and therefore has to take their own personal vehicle in a reimbursable situation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=383)|
| 0:06:28| That would only be me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=388)|
| 0:06:29| I'm the one that gets called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=389)|
| 0:06:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=390)|
| 0:06:31| And I just don't go to the trouble to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=391)|
| 0:06:35| I could count the mileage on my personal vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=395)|
| 0:06:37| I just don't bother to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=397)|
| 0:06:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=400)|
| 0:06:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=401)|
| 0:06:42| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=402)|
| 0:06:43| Lynn, let me ask you real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=403)|
| 0:06:44| When you said they took, I think you said Mark Jones took your vehicle away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=404)|
| 0:06:47| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=407)|
| 0:06:48| Did they compensate you in any way for other pay, or is that just?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=408)|
| 0:06:51| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=411)|
| 0:06:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=412)|
| 0:06:53| I appreciate your leadership there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=413)|
| 0:06:54| If you do want to compensate me, I'd be glad to take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=414)|
| 0:06:57| No, I mean, that vehicle was, I mean, it was obvious that all it was was a parked, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=417)|
| 0:07:06| And you'd had it for, how long did you have it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=426)|
| 0:07:11| I got it when I was appointed director, which was in 1999.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=431)|
| 0:07:16| So I had it for several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=436)|
| 0:07:18| Several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=438)|
| 0:07:19| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=439)|
| 0:07:20| I mean, in some ways it's kind of, you're always having to worry about where you're at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=440)|
| 0:07:26| and sometimes it can be more of an obstacle than it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=446)|
| 0:07:31| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=451)|
| 0:07:32| Lynn, you do a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=452)|
| 0:07:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=454)|
| 0:07:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=455)|
| 0:07:36| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=456)|
| 0:07:38| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=458)|
| 0:07:40| Oh, Lynn, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=460)|
| 0:07:43| I tried to get out of there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=463)|
| 0:07:46| How many permit fees have you lost in the recent past, and what were, could you just give us a brief on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=466)|
| 0:07:54| We lost about, I want to say about $25,000 with the two C-Ray plants that have been mothballed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=474)|
| 0:08:03| Our total fee budget can get upwards of $300,000 between Title V sources and regular sources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=483)|
| 0:08:15| So $25,000 is a substantial hit to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=495)|
| 0:08:19| We're watching other companies very closely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=499)|
| 0:08:21| General Shale has also gone under the brick manufacturing portion of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=501)|
| 0:08:27| They've kept the concrete block portion of the plant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=507)|
| 0:08:30| but the portion that was causing the pollution that they were getting the fees assessed to was from the brick manufacturing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=510)|
| 0:08:36| So that was probably another $10,000 there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=516)|
| 0:08:39| So probably about a total of $35,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=519)|
| 0:08:41| That's in the last year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=521)|
| 0:08:42| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=522)|
| 0:08:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=523)|
| 0:08:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=524)|
| 0:08:46| Commissioner Mark Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=526)|
| 0:08:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=527)|
| 0:08:48| Lynn, you may know this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=528)|
| 0:08:49| I'm not sure who would, but I'll give you a shot at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=529)|
| 0:08:53| Other counties have a mineral extraction fee that sometimes pays for some anti-pollution activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=533)|
| 0:08:59| Knox County does not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=539)|
| 0:09:01| Do you know the reasoning on that, how much money would be raised by that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=541)|
| 0:09:05| And if anyone does, I'd like to hear that sometime today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=545)|
| 0:09:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=548)|
| 0:09:09| I'm not aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=549)|
| 0:09:10| Like I said, we're just air quality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=550)|
| 0:09:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=552)|
| 0:09:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=553)|
| 0:09:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=556)|
| 0:09:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=558)|
| 0:09:19| Next we have County Clerk Foster Arnett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=559)|
| 0:09:29| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=569)|
| 0:09:30| It's a pleasure to be here with all of you, ladies and gentlemen of County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=570)|
| 0:09:35| Before I get started, I would be terribly remiss if I didn't recognize Kim Ellis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=575)|
| 0:09:42| and Angie Nesbitt for all the great work that they do for this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=582)|
| 0:09:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=588)|
| 0:09:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=589)|
| 0:09:50| And for our office, it's funny because Kim and Angie are just such sweet people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=590)|
| 0:09:55| and they always have a smile on their face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=595)|
| 0:09:57| And I'll be going out the door sometimes at 530 or quarter to six,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=597)|
| 0:10:01| and they'll just be in there just working away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=601)|
| 0:10:03| And I just admire you very much, and thank you for what you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=603)|
| 0:10:07| We've got a lot of exciting things going on in the clerk's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=607)|
| 0:10:10| and I'm glad to spend a few minutes here to tell you about them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=610)|
| 0:10:13| Since taking office in September, I've made a lot of changes in that office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=613)|
| 0:10:17| designated to make us more fiscally responsible to the taxpayers of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=617)|
| 0:10:22| I promise to be a good steward of this office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=622)|
| 0:10:24| and I'm delighted to tell you that I'm following up on those promises this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=624)|
| 0:10:29| I also appreciate your commitment as a legislative body to go through this process of open government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=629)|
| 0:10:35| and to do the right thing because I truly believe that the only way that we can be held accountable to our bosses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=635)|
| 0:10:41| the taxpayers, is by forums and meetings such as this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=641)|
| 0:10:46| Since I've been in office, we've been able to save nearly $300,000 through attrition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=646)|
| 0:10:50| and also by eliminating services that I found to be a waste of taxpayer dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=650)|
| 0:10:56| such as plant rental and plant watering that was costing everybody in this room $6,500 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=656)|
| 0:11:05| We now will go to Walmart and buy plants and water them ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=665)|
| 0:11:10| I also canceled a contract which was in place to refill our taxpayer-funded first aid kits to the tune of $4,700 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=670)|
| 0:11:19| We get those now from the County Department of Safety, saving $4,700 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=679)|
| 0:11:25| One of my first official actions as clerk was unpopular,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=685)|
| 0:11:29| but it was to cancel employee paid holidays for Christmas shopping and for birthdays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=689)|
| 0:11:34| That saved us $26,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=694)|
| 0:11:37| And I'm holding each and every member of my office accountable to arrive before the doors open to the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=697)|
| 0:11:44| and to be ready to meet and greet when those doors open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=704)|
| 0:11:48| We also have about 92 percent of our staff completely cross-trained now to be more efficient to our taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=708)|
| 0:11:55| Customer service is absolutely job one in the Knox County Clerk's Office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=715)|
| 0:11:59| and as part of my total commitment to our employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=719)|
| 0:12:03| I have visited our satellite offices over 130 times in the last eight months of my administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=723)|
| 0:12:10| I've established a total open-door policy not only with our employees, but with you ladies and gentlemen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=730)|
| 0:12:15| with the news media, with the general public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=735)|
| 0:12:18| As you know, I wrote you all a letter six weeks ago urging you to come and look at our office and see what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=738)|
| 0:12:25| I've met with every employee in my office and established an employee of the month program as a perk for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=745)|
| 0:12:31| And as part of that perk, they get a meal at any of the Aubrey's restaurants that I pay for out of my pocket| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=751)|
| 0:12:37| because I don't think it's fair to tax our taxpayers with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=757)|
| 0:12:41| We also have a monthly newsletter, and we are now bringing our front-line managers on to get more outside training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=761)|
| 0:12:49| We also attend regional clerk meetings that I understand were not attended on a regular basis before I took office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=769)|
| 0:12:55| And we take between five and eight of our front-line employees, the absolute backbone of our office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=775)|
| 0:13:01| It's a day trip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=781)|
| 0:13:02| We go to Morristown, and they get to meet other clerks, and they get to see practices from other clerks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=782)|
| 0:13:07| And it gives them an opportunity to come back and tell other workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=787)|
| 0:13:11| And the next, it's every other month we meet, we'll take five to ten more people so they can be involved in what's going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=791)|
| 0:13:18| because I want them to understand what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=798)|
| 0:13:21| The employee count when I came on board was 106.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=801)|
| 0:13:24| Today it stands at 97.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=804)|
| 0:13:26| We're working leaner and smarter, and we're holding the line on expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=806)|
| 0:13:30| We have been and continue to enforce strict sick leave policies to cut down on abuse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=810)|
| 0:13:35| which was, frankly, quite rampant when I took office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=815)|
| 0:13:39| We had some employees that were on the cusp of losing their job because they'd get an hour and they'd take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=819)|
| 0:13:45| We've counseled them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=825)|
| 0:13:46| We've been able to turn around some employees that were less than exemplary into outstanding performers now for our office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=826)|
| 0:13:54| I've also begun a visitation for sick employees and their immediate families where it's warranted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=834)|
| 0:14:01| And when we lose a family member, I go to the services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=841)|
| 0:14:04| because I want our employees to know how much I care about them and what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=844)|
| 0:14:09| We've revamped our bad check policy system to retrieve more money than ever for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=849)|
| 0:14:14| To date, since I took office, we have recovered over $40,000 in bad checks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=854)|
| 0:14:20| We've established an auto dealer department, which not only helps our local dealers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=860)|
| 0:14:25| and turn over their work faster but to make sure that the money stays in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=865)|
| 0:14:32| We've streamlined our office organizational chart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=872)|
| 0:14:35| and we urge our employees to come up with money-saving ideas, which will be rewarded by the office year to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=875)|
| 0:14:42| And I know this is what you're interested in hearing in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=882)|
| 0:14:44| We've turned over $800,000 in excess fees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=884)|
| 0:14:47| and I expect to give you another check for $300,000 by the end of July,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=887)|
| 0:14:52| which will bring it to $1.1 million in excess fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=892)|
| 0:14:56| And I promise you today, if we can find more money, we'll give you more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=896)|
| 0:15:01| While our tax collections are down six percent, we still collected $9.1 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=901)|
| 0:15:07| and our business tax collections are up almost $1 million, $900,000 to be exact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=907)|
| 0:15:13| because of my priority to go after business owners who have not paid their business taxes for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=913)|
| 0:15:19| I was told not to do this, that it was political suicide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=919)|
| 0:15:22| Sorry. You owe the county money. You're going to pay the county your money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=922)|
| 0:15:26| You may remember in October of last year, I found out that we had business owners, small mom and pops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=926)|
| 0:15:33| that were overpaying their business taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=933)|
| 0:15:36| And when I asked what happened to that money, I was told we keep it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=936)|
| 0:15:39| I said, no, we don't. That's not right. It's not our money. It's their money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=939)|
| 0:15:42| We turned over 779 checks to business owners when they overpaid their taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=942)|
| 0:15:48| From July 8th until April of this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=948)|
| 0:15:50| our employees have processed over half a million transactions in our seven locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=950)|
| 0:15:56| As you know also, we're working on a flat budget that was left by a former administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=956)|
| 0:16:00| and in light of that, we are still within that budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=960)|
| 0:16:03| and we will come within that budget by the end of this budget cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=963)|
| 0:16:07| Even with these numbers and the numbers we anticipate for next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=967)|
| 0:16:11| we'll turn over at least a million dollars in excess taxes next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=971)|
| 0:16:16| I firmly believe, ladies and gentlemen, we have to work together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=976)|
| 0:16:20| We have to help each other because if we don't, the citizens of Knox County will suffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=980)|
| 0:16:27| So I look forward to working with you on this, and with that, I'll take any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=987)|
| 0:16:31| I've brought some of my staff with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=991)|
| 0:16:33| If I don't know the answer, I'll ask them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=993)|
| 0:16:35| If they don't know the answer, I promise you, you'll have the answer by the end of the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=995)|
| 0:16:40| Okay. Before we get to some questions, I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1000)|
| 0:16:42| You mentioned the will tax brought in nine or so million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1002)|
| 0:16:48| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1008)|
| 0:16:49| And is that for so far through the year up to this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1009)|
| 0:16:52| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1012)|
| 0:16:53| Okay. So we still have a few more months to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1013)|
| 0:16:55| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1015)|
| 0:16:56| Because I know that we've budgeted probably closer to 12, right, John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1016)|
| 0:17:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1020)|
| 0:17:01| We still have two more months, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1021)|
| 0:17:03| Okay. Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1023)|
| 0:17:07| Foster, I really appreciate the things you are doing in the clerk's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1027)|
| 0:17:11| I think you're doing a great job with budgetary concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1031)|
| 0:17:14| I'm going to talk to you more as a car dealer today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1034)|
| 0:17:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1037)|
| 0:17:18| Have you considered expanding your services?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1038)|
| 0:17:21| I know that I, myself, I'm in the rebuild end of the car business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1041)|
| 0:17:28| and I have to go to Nashville to, we call it fast tracking, to deliver my paperwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1048)|
| 0:17:35| Have you considered offering that service here in Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1055)|
| 0:17:39| It may help some folks like myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1059)|
| 0:17:42| And, again, I'm talking to you as an automobile dealer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1062)|
| 0:17:45| And it also, I'm sure that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1065)|
| 0:17:48| Knox County would get a percentage of those fees, which are getting pretty high these days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1068)|
| 0:17:53| I think it's about $85 per automobile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1073)|
| 0:17:57| And I'm not sure what the state percentage, what they would allow you to keep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1077)|
| 0:18:02| But have you considered things like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1082)|
| 0:18:05| Well, I haven't, Commissioner Lambert, because that's the first I've heard of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1085)|
| 0:18:08| But what I'll do is I'll get one of my automobile folks to come and see you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1088)|
| 0:18:13| and let's sit down and talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1093)|
| 0:18:15| I think that's a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1095)|
| 0:18:16| If it's something that helps you and helps us, heck, yeah, I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1096)|
| 0:18:19| And I think that what you've done with having the, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1099)|
| 0:18:24| the special windows where you can drop off, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1104)|
| 0:18:28| dealer work in bulk has been a real help to my industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1108)|
| 0:18:32| Not that we're able to bring you big piles of paperwork like we would like to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1112)|
| 0:18:37| but it has been a big help being able to drop that stuff off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1117)|
| 0:18:40| And, you know, I think it's probably helped your other attendants deal with the public a lot quicker also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1120)|
| 0:18:48| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1128)|
| 0:18:49| It has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1129)|
| 0:18:50| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1130)|
| 0:18:51| I mean, we sat down and talked with several dealers, and we saw a need there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1131)|
| 0:18:54| And if we can help you guys, and we are seeing more of those, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1134)|
| 0:18:59| more cars are being sold, so we're working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1139)|
| 0:19:02| We just added another person to that unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1142)|
| 0:19:04| So I'll get them in touch with you, and let's talk about it, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1144)|
| 0:19:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1147)|
| 0:19:08| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1148)|
| 0:19:09| And, again, I appreciate all the work you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1149)|
| 0:19:10| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1150)|
| 0:19:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1151)|
| 0:19:12| We are on a tight budget, so we'll try to make comments quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1152)|
| 0:19:15| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1155)|
| 0:19:17| Foster, I want to say just two things real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1157)|
| 0:19:19| Number one, you seem to get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1159)|
| 0:19:21| It's about customer service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1161)|
| 0:19:23| And I appreciate you as an officeholder, what you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1163)|
| 0:19:26| You went into your job, and you said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1166)|
| 0:19:28| I'm here for the people, the taxpayers, and how we can give them better customer service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1168)|
| 0:19:32| In the meantime, how we can save Knox County money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1172)|
| 0:19:34| And I think you've done an outstanding job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1174)|
| 0:19:36| I'm real proud of you, Foster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1176)|
| 0:19:37| You've done a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1177)|
| 0:19:38| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1178)|
| 0:19:40| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1180)|
| 0:19:42| Foster, how's the wheel tax running compared to last year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1182)|
| 0:19:47| Commissioner, I don't really know as opposed to last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1187)|
| 0:19:51| Do we have ñ I'll get that number to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1191)|
| 0:19:54| The reason why I'm asking you, you said we have $9 million now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1194)|
| 0:19:57| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1197)|
| 0:19:58| We budgeted $1 million a month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1198)|
| 0:20:00| and it doesn't look like we're in the 10th month already, which you should have in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1200)|
| 0:20:03| So we're running less than $1 million a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1203)|
| 0:20:05| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1205)|
| 0:20:06| Mind on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1206)|
| 0:20:07| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1207)|
| 0:20:08| Well, and one of the things we attribute it with, and Commissioner Lambert kind of hit on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1208)|
| 0:20:11| Commissioner, I don't think people were buying as many cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1211)|
| 0:20:14| Perhaps some people are parking their vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1214)|
| 0:20:17| And we've still got two months left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1217)|
| 0:20:19| But we're going to have to do better than a million a month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1219)|
| 0:20:21| and we haven't been doing a million a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1221)|
| 0:20:23| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1223)|
| 0:20:24| But, you know, all we can do, Commissioner, is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1224)|
| 0:20:30| when these folks come in to renew their wheel tax, we do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1230)|
| 0:20:35| I don't know any other way if somebody chooses to park their automobile and not renew their life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1235)|
| 0:20:40| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1240)|
| 0:20:41| What I'm saying is things look like getting tight because we're running behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1241)|
| 0:20:45| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1245)|
| 0:20:46| But we normally should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1246)|
| 0:20:47| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1247)|
| 0:20:48| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1248)|
| 0:20:49| Mr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1249)|
| 0:20:50| Just a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1250)|
| 0:20:51| I was looking at the monies that have been allocated on the budget this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1251)|
| 0:20:58| and I know that you all aren't on the salary part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1258)|
| 0:21:00| How do you do the salaries exactly in your office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1260)|
| 0:21:03| We have turned our salaries over to the Knox County Finance Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1263)|
| 0:21:07| and we do the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1267)|
| 0:21:09| We turn it over to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1269)|
| 0:21:10| They cut the checks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1270)|
| 0:21:11| That's payroll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1271)|
| 0:21:12| I meant as far as determining the salaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1272)|
| 0:21:15| Do you all go through the salary suit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1275)|
| 0:21:17| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1277)|
| 0:21:18| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1278)|
| 0:21:19| I misunderstood you, Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1279)|
| 0:21:20| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1280)|
| 0:21:21| We go through the salary suit every year, and we, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1281)|
| 0:21:25| prepare for so many people and file that salary suit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1285)|
| 0:21:29| And that goes through Chancery Court?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1289)|
| 0:21:31| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1291)|
| 0:21:32| And the second thing is, do you all use P cards in your office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1292)|
| 0:21:36| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1296)|
| 0:21:37| We have, I think, two P cards in our office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1297)|
| 0:21:39| My chief deputy, Bruce Whitaker, has one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1299)|
| 0:21:41| and his administrative assistant has one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1301)|
| 0:21:44| And Mr. Whitaker goes over it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1304)|
| 0:21:47| His administrative assistant goes over it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1307)|
| 0:21:49| Mr. Skaggs in our finance department goes over it, and I go over it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1309)|
| 0:21:54| As a matter of fact, I just looked at yesterday's, and I can promise you it's to the penny,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1314)|
| 0:21:59| and there's no abuse on those P cards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1319)|
| 0:22:01| And how many full-time employees do you have and how many part-time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1321)|
| 0:22:05| Ninety-seven full-time employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1325)|
| 0:22:08| That includes the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1328)|
| 0:22:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1329)|
| 0:22:10| Then we have 95.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1330)|
| 0:22:12| Ninety-five and two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1332)|
| 0:22:14| Ninety-five full-time and two part-time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1334)|
| 0:22:16| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1336)|
| 0:22:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1337)|
| 0:22:18| And then one final question I'm going to ask this of the trustee also is because we have offices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1338)|
| 0:22:22| you know, satellite offices that aren't used extensively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1342)|
| 0:22:26| Some are used more than others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1346)|
| 0:22:28| And I know the trustees have people in the same offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1348)|
| 0:22:31| Is there ever any opportunity to cross-train people so we don't have people sitting around that may not be busy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1351)|
| 0:22:38| particularly in the underutilized satellites?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1358)|
| 0:22:40| Yes, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1360)|
| 0:22:41| We have, as I told you, cross-trained 92% of our people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1361)|
| 0:22:44| The problem with cross-training, as I understand it, between the trustee's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1364)|
| 0:22:48| and the clerk's office is we're handling two different pieces of monies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1368)|
| 0:22:52| and that we are not to commingle those monies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1372)|
| 0:22:55| So I feel very strongly that our people cross-train.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1375)|
| 0:22:59| Of course, you know, theirs is a seasonal business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1379)|
| 0:23:01| Ours is an everyday business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1381)|
| 0:23:03| And I would put ours up, frankly, to any other clerk's office in the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1383)|
| 0:23:08| They run those people through real quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1388)|
| 0:23:11| But, yes, sir, we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1391)|
| 0:23:12| And hopefully in another, I don't know, 60 days we'll have everybody cross-trained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1392)|
| 0:23:17| And this is just one final question that always comes up, and I'd just like to get your comment on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1397)|
| 0:23:22| is that if we compare Knox County to some of the other counties like Davidson County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1402)|
| 0:23:26| the question always comes up is that we have half the amount of population,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1406)|
| 0:23:31| but we have twice the number of employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1411)|
| 0:23:33| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1413)|
| 0:23:34| And what's the explanation for that when people ask me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1414)|
| 0:23:37| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1417)|
| 0:23:38| The explanation, Dr. Briggs, is that we do more things than our satellite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1418)|
| 0:23:42| We are a full-service satellite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1422)|
| 0:23:45| In Davidson County, they have four satellite offices, but all they do is auto-registration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1425)|
| 0:23:50| If you have to do anything else, you have to go downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1430)|
| 0:23:53| So it's a convenience factor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1433)|
| 0:23:55| Convenience factor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1435)|
| 0:23:56| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1436)|
| 0:23:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1437)|
| 0:23:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1438)|
| 0:23:59| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1439)|
| 0:24:00| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1440)|
| 0:24:01| Mr. Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1441)|
| 0:24:02| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1442)|
| 0:24:03| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1443)|
| 0:24:04| Thanks for doing such a great job for us this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1444)|
| 0:24:05| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1445)|
| 0:24:06| I do have one small request to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1446)|
| 0:24:07| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1447)|
| 0:24:08| This is very important to me personally as a small business owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1448)|
| 0:24:10| If you're going to buy houseplants instead of buying them at Walmart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1450)|
| 0:24:14| why don't you consider buying them from one of our great local nurseries such as Stanley's in south Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1454)|
| 0:24:20| so that the taxpayers' money is reinvested back into businesses in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1460)|
| 0:24:25| I think that's a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1465)|
| 0:24:26| We haven't bought them anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1466)|
| 0:24:27| I was just trying to make a little levity there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1467)|
| 0:24:29| Obviously, it didn't work, but that's a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1469)|
| 0:24:33| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1473)|
| 0:24:35| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1475)|
| 0:24:36| Hey, Foster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1476)|
| 0:24:37| We spoke a couple of months ago in commission, and me and you have spoken about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1477)|
| 0:24:41| Your satellite offices, what's your utilization, and are we being as efficient as we can, do you think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1481)|
| 0:24:49| Well, if I may, I'd like to ask my Chief Deputy, Bruce Whitaker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1489)|
| 0:24:53| just to hand out something for you that will show transaction costs per office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1493)|
| 0:24:58| annual transactions by office, and annual costs, rent and utilities and payroll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1498)|
| 0:25:04| I don't know that Chairman Leuthold will like for you guys to discuss this now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1504)|
| 0:25:10| It's up to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1510)|
| 0:25:12| Well, we are going way beyond your ten minutes, so if we could try to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1512)|
| 0:25:18| Well, I just want to kind of see where we're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1518)|
| 0:25:22| Well, I mean, if you look, just very quickly, if you look at the first page,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1522)|
| 0:25:25| and I have copies for the news media, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1525)|
| 0:25:28| If you look, just real quickly, the old courthouse costs per transaction is $6.82.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1528)|
| 0:25:35| Halls is $8.31.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1535)|
| 0:25:36| Knoxville Center is $5.63.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1536)|
| 0:25:38| Five Points is $16.11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1538)|
| 0:25:41| South is $6.38.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1541)|
| 0:25:43| Farragut is $3.89.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1543)|
| 0:25:44| And Cedar Bluff is $4.94.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1544)|
| 0:25:51| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1551)|
| 0:25:52| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1552)|
| 0:25:53| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1553)|
| 0:25:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1554)|
| 0:25:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1555)|
| 0:25:58| Is that Commissioner Saunders or is it Ivan Harmon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1558)|
| 0:26:04| Also, just a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1564)|
| 0:26:05| The wheel tax exempts, do we have anybody that gets exempt from the wheel tax?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1565)|
| 0:26:09| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1569)|
| 0:26:10| Do you know how many possibly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1570)|
| 0:26:12| No, sir, but I can find out for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1572)|
| 0:26:14| I'm just curious to how much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1574)|
| 0:26:15| Do you know, Bruce?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1575)|
| 0:26:16| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1576)|
| 0:26:17| The wheel tax exempts, how many do we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1577)|
| 0:26:19| I don't have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1579)|
| 0:26:20| We'll get that for you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1580)|
| 0:26:21| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1581)|
| 0:26:22| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1582)|
| 0:26:28| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1588)|
| 0:26:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1591)|
| 0:26:32| Any others?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1592)|
| 0:26:34| We're going to have to take a real quick break here to allow for our recording.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1594)|
| 0:26:39| We had a little trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1599)|
| 0:26:40| That's why we're running behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1600)|
| 0:26:42| And he's now here to fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1602)|
| 0:26:44| And we're going to take just a few minutes to allow them to get us up and running so they can record this digitally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1604)|
| 0:26:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1609)|
| 0:26:50| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1610)|
| 0:26:51| Thank you, Foster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1611)|
| 0:26:54| We're going to go ahead and get started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1614)|
| 0:26:56| We're still having trouble with the recording device, but we have other means to keep it recorded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1616)|
| 0:27:02| And we're going to get next up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1622)|
| 0:27:08| John Troyer, Finance, and you can keep this brief if you'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1628)|
| 0:27:13| Mr. Chairman, I will go with the wishes of the Chair and I'll keep this brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1633)|
| 0:27:20| I would like to report the Finance Department, again, received the Certificate of Achievement for Financial Reporting this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1640)|
| 0:27:27| The Finance Department also received the Distinguished Budget Award from the Government Finance Officers Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1647)|
| 0:27:34| During the year, the county received a bond rating upgrade from Standard & Poor's from AA to AA+.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1654)|
| 0:27:41| And we have taken on additional responsibilities through a centralized payroll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1661)|
| 0:27:46| We've not asked for any new positions to take on those responsibilities in payroll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1666)|
| 0:27:53| And we have changed some duties within that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1673)|
| 0:27:58| I would like to remind everybody, last year, budget to budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1678)|
| 0:28:02| the Finance Department's budget was reduced by $189,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1682)|
| 0:28:07| And, again, this year I'm happy to report that our budget request is down by $17,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1687)|
| 0:28:12| so a two-year decrease of $206,984 for the Finance Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1692)|
| 0:28:19| We're trying to do more with less and trying to provide good service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1699)|
| 0:28:26| Commissioner Mark Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1706)|
| 0:28:28| Thank you, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1708)|
| 0:28:29| I appreciate all those decreases I saw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1709)|
| 0:28:30| There were two areas of increase that I wanted to ask about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1710)|
| 0:28:33| One was an area of a $4,350 increase in contracts with other agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1713)|
| 0:28:40| And the other one was a $5,650 increase in employee travel education training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1720)|
| 0:28:46| What's going on there, and why did those go up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1726)|
| 0:28:49| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1729)|
| 0:28:50| We've got some specific projects that we're doing on our budget software that are both related to that same issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1730)|
| 0:28:56| is that we are required and we need to keep up to date on our budget software to do additional programming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1736)|
| 0:29:02| to keep those up to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1742)|
| 0:29:03| And so those contracts are the additional programming costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1743)|
| 0:29:07| Additional travel costs is that rather than send more people other places,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1747)|
| 0:29:11| we are paying for the trainers to come here and provide better training for our people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1751)|
| 0:29:18| but we have to, through the contract, pay their travel to get here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1758)|
| 0:29:21| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1761)|
| 0:29:23| But, yeah, you take the services overall and we're down $200.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1763)|
| 0:29:27| Our supplies and materials, exactly the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1767)|
| 0:29:31| Our insurance, workers' comp, general liability is up by $200.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1771)|
| 0:29:35| But, yeah, we're happy to talk individual items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1775)|
| 0:29:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1780)|
| 0:29:41| Well, we can get into that type of discussion here at the end if you want to, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1781)|
| 0:29:46| Of course, sir, Ivan Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1786)|
| 0:29:48| John, a question about the second harvest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1788)|
| 0:29:50| I know we've heard a lot of news on TV and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1790)|
| 0:29:53| Can you explain to us what happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1793)|
| 0:29:54| I know they failed to get the paperwork in, but some people don't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1794)|
| 0:29:58| So would you explain a little bit about what happened to second harvest?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1798)|
| 0:30:01| The proposal that the commission has before you is based on the mayor felt compelled to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1801)|
| 0:30:09| since the community grants panels have been in place for two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1809)|
| 0:30:12| the mayor helped to design those community panels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1812)|
| 0:30:16| The mayor felt compelled to recommend exactly what the community panels had recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1816)|
| 0:30:21| Now, I do think there will be additional information that's going to come out later today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1821)|
| 0:30:27| And so, Ivan, I'd like to defer until a little bit later| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1827)|
| 0:30:31| and there will be more information about second harvest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1831)|
| 0:30:34| Commissioner Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1834)|
| 0:30:36| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1836)|
| 0:30:37| Let me ask you a general, and I know we're scheduled tight, debt service question in regard to the stimulus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1837)|
| 0:30:45| A lot of debate for and against it and somewhere in between, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1845)|
| 0:30:49| And I meant to ask you this last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1849)|
| 0:30:51| but are you being able to use any of the Build America Bond structures, the taxable debt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1851)|
| 0:30:59| We are looking into that and we are trying to do our homework on that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1859)|
| 0:31:05| It may be to our advantage, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1865)|
| 0:31:08| It could very well be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1868)|
| 0:31:09| And so that's part of we're trying to work through the details on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1869)|
| 0:31:12| and do that as part of our structure, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1872)|
| 0:31:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1875)|
| 0:31:16| Well, let us know how that goes because I'm sort of intrigued by that concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1876)|
| 0:31:19| You mean it's taxable debt, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1879)|
| 0:31:22| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1882)|
| 0:31:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1883)|
| 0:31:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1884)|
| 0:31:25| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1885)|
| 0:31:26| Just very quickly, we usually talk about our fund balance at the end of the year being around $39 million or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1886)|
| 0:31:34| What time of year or how do you determine that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1894)|
| 0:31:36| Because it changes so much during the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1896)|
| 0:31:39| In October, probably about the first or the first week or two of October, we're probably close to broke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1899)|
| 0:31:45| And then by the time we're at the middle of March, we have a lot of excess funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1905)|
| 0:31:53| When you come up with that number of $39 million, is that the June 30 number when the fiscal year ends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1913)|
| 0:31:58| or at what time of year do you use that number or where do we get that number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1918)|
| 0:32:03| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1923)|
| 0:32:04| Our financial reports, like you mentioned, you're exactly right, is June 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1924)|
| 0:32:09| And so we keep score when we end the fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1929)|
| 0:32:13| What we like to say is the general fund, undesignated fund balance is $39 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1933)|
| 0:32:18| and I think that's our best measure of fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1938)|
| 0:32:22| And, yes, there's a wide variation within the fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1942)|
| 0:32:26| I have to work very closely with the trustee's office in trying to plan and manage our cash flows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1946)|
| 0:32:31| and that's a topic of another day's discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1951)|
| 0:32:37| Just one other question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1957)|
| 0:32:38| I think we're drawing about $3 million or so out of the general fund, aren't we, to do the budget this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1958)|
| 0:32:45| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1965)|
| 0:32:46| And I'm very, very comfortable with that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1966)|
| 0:32:47| And that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1967)|
| 0:32:49| I understand what the rainy day fund is and it's raining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1969)|
| 0:32:52| But the question I have is, is that going to cause us a problem the first part of October?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1972)|
| 0:32:58| Because I know last year it was almost on a day-to-day basis where the account was down to close to zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1978)|
| 0:33:05| Or will we have to look at taking one of the tax anticipatory notes out this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1985)|
| 0:33:10| because the fund balance is a little lower than it's been in the past?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1990)|
| 0:33:13| That is an option, and that's something that we have considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1993)|
| 0:33:17| That could provide us a measure of stability with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=1997)|
| 0:33:23| but we've chosen not to do that to just try to save the interest cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2003)|
| 0:33:28| But, you know, that's something that we don't have proposed in the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2008)|
| 0:33:32| but it's something that we could still do depending on how our numbers come out in June, July, or August or September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2012)|
| 0:33:39| We can do it as late as September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2019)|
| 0:33:42| The county's had adequate fund balances to be able to manage through the low periods without needing a tax anticipation note,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2022)|
| 0:33:49| and we hope to avoid that cost if we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2029)|
| 0:33:52| And I think we will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2032)|
| 0:33:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2033)|
| 0:33:55| All right, seeing no other lights on, thank you, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2035)|
| 0:33:58| And we'll keep moving on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2038)|
| 0:34:01| Juvenile Judge Tim Irwin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2041)|
| 0:34:05| And, Judge, you can keep it as short as you'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2045)|
| 0:34:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2048)|
| 0:34:10| I will keep it short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2050)|
| 0:34:12| Short's kind of foreign to my nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2052)|
| 0:34:16| I said as much as you would like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2056)|
| 0:34:20| I don't know how many people understand exactly what our operation is at juvenile court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2060)|
| 0:34:25| There are times when I'd like to rip the veil off that place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2065)|
| 0:34:29| and show county government in Knox County exactly what goes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2069)|
| 0:34:33| I'm very proud of what our 46 employees are able to accomplish up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2073)|
| 0:34:38| In 2007, the courts heard 22,000 matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2078)|
| 0:34:42| In 2008, my courts heard 29,000 matters, a sizable increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2082)|
| 0:34:49| We're handling that increase with the same number of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2089)|
| 0:34:52| We have asked for a couple of very modest adjustments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2092)|
| 0:34:56| If you'll look at, and I won't try to go into these in detail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2096)|
| 0:35:01| the first one is just an adjustment that gets people paid for what they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2101)|
| 0:35:06| We had some inequities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2106)|
| 0:35:09| I want to explain what Marie Bly is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2109)|
| 0:35:12| Many of you knew Larry Gibney was with the court 36 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2112)|
| 0:35:14| and was gracious enough to stay with me for a year and a half to help me transition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2114)|
| 0:35:19| When he retired, we took his salary and split it up over some various people in the department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2119)|
| 0:35:25| but we hired Marie Bly with that salary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2125)|
| 0:35:27| and she brings with her five master-level interns in the Department of Social Work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2127)|
| 0:35:35| from the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2135)|
| 0:35:37| She coordinates them, and she is our mental health triage person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2137)|
| 0:35:41| We have families come to us in crisis not knowing what to do, where to turn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2141)|
| 0:35:47| and she's very effective, and I would ask that you honor her contract again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2147)|
| 0:35:52| It is in the mayor's request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2152)|
| 0:35:55| I want to point out some savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2155)|
| 0:35:58| We are doing our own recycling project at Juvenile Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2158)|
| 0:36:01| We tried through the county several times, and we're told it's simply not available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2161)|
| 0:36:06| so my employees have taken it on themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2166)|
| 0:36:09| They're very green-oriented, and we collect the bottles and the cans and the paper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2169)|
| 0:36:14| and we carry it off ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2174)|
| 0:36:16| I don't know if that saves the county any money, but I feel good about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2176)|
| 0:36:20| We have signs up everywhere reminding people to turn off their computer and lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2180)|
| 0:36:24| And a small thing, we think we're going to have considerable savings on our drug testing supplies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2184)|
| 0:36:31| Let me turn just briefly before I take your questions, if you have any,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2191)|
| 0:36:36| let me turn just briefly to a couple of problem areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2196)|
| 0:36:40| At the end of April, I was notified by our clerk, Ms. Quist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2200)|
| 0:36:44| that we were out of guardian ad litem money for the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2204)|
| 0:36:47| You just heard about a 25% or so increase in caseload.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2207)|
| 0:36:53| Many of those cases, the statutes require me to appoint guardian ad litems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2213)|
| 0:36:58| translators, counsel for indigent parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2218)|
| 0:37:02| The fund from Knox County that pays for those things went broke in April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2222)|
| 0:37:06| That's a fund that's run by Ms. Quist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2226)|
| 0:37:08| I was unaware of that at the time we submitted our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2228)|
| 0:37:12| But that fund is out of money right now, and I don't know how those bills are being paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2232)|
| 0:37:17| I don't have a choice as to whether or not I appointed guardian ad litem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2237)|
| 0:37:22| I've got to keep doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2242)|
| 0:37:24| The other bit of bad news we received last year was a case that Judge Susano heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2244)|
| 0:37:30| and he decided a case correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2250)|
| 0:37:32| Please don't blame Judge Susano.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2252)|
| 0:37:34| But the state no longer pays for kids that have been committed to a mental health facility by the juvenile courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2254)|
| 0:37:45| We call those a JCCO, a juvenile commitment order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2265)|
| 0:37:48| The state no longer pays for those because of a controversial area of the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2268)|
| 0:37:56| They were supposed to fix it in the legislature this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2276)|
| 0:37:58| It was the word incidental that was interpreted in a court of appeals decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2278)|
| 0:38:04| and it was interpreted in a way by Judge Susano, and I think he's right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2284)|
| 0:38:08| that the state only had to pay for incidental expenses, not the exams themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2288)|
| 0:38:13| This is something they had done for many years on felony cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2293)|
| 0:38:17| and Knoxville had averaged about five commitment orders a year that the state was paying for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2297)|
| 0:38:24| Nashville, for example, has 300 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2304)|
| 0:38:28| It's not been a problem yet, but it's going to be one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2308)|
| 0:38:31| It's not anticipated in this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2311)|
| 0:38:34| I would suggest that you take a look at that and decide in your wisdom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2314)|
| 0:38:39| I'm not going to ask for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2319)|
| 0:38:40| I don't feel like there's any money to ask for right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2320)|
| 0:38:43| But if we have a kid that's brought in by the family saying we can't do this anymore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2323)|
| 0:38:48| and the kid's going bonkers, I really don't have any recourse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2328)|
| 0:38:52| I don't have any money anywhere to pay for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2332)|
| 0:38:55| I don't have a mental health hospital here that will take them probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2335)|
| 0:38:59| Most of them are too violent to house at Peninsula,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2339)|
| 0:39:02| and most of the time that involves a trip to Chattanooga or Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2342)|
| 0:39:06| and we have transportation problems on the weekends and at night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2346)|
| 0:39:10| and we're depending on a mobile crisis unit to come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2350)|
| 0:39:15| But this decision has really put us in a bind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2355)|
| 0:39:18| and the reason it's a bind is the legislature promised to fix it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2358)|
| 0:39:23| but the Department of Mental Health took the money that they've been spending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2363)|
| 0:39:28| and allocated it somewhere else and it hadn't been fixed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2368)|
| 0:39:30| and it's not going to get fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2370)|
| 0:39:32| So the courts, the juvenile courts across the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2372)|
| 0:39:35| are going to be left with no power to commit unless it comes from the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2375)|
| 0:39:39| And I'm sorry to give you that bad news today, but that's what we're left with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2379)|
| 0:39:44| We kept hoping that the legislature would correct the problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2384)|
| 0:39:47| but they haven't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2387)|
| 0:39:48| We think that it would be appropriate to consider perhaps $30,000 in medical services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2388)|
| 0:39:55| We think we're going to have a big savings in medical services because of our new drug tests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2395)|
| 0:40:00| which have cut our monthly costs from about $2,000 to about $500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2400)|
| 0:40:05| And I don't think that I'll need to use very many of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2405)|
| 0:40:07| I've only done a couple in three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2407)|
| 0:40:11| But it would be nice to have the option in an emergency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2411)|
| 0:40:15| to take care of a mentally ill child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2415)|
| 0:40:17| We have a, quote, rubber room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2417)|
| 0:40:20| but that rubber room doesn't give the child the drugs or the treatment they need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2420)|
| 0:40:25| and we're totally relying on mobile crisis determination as to whether or not the kid's committable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2425)|
| 0:40:30| I don't have any other option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2430)|
| 0:40:32| I can't order that 30-day study at Peninsula anymore like I used to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2432)|
| 0:40:36| The guardian ad litem thing is a bigger problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2436)|
| 0:40:40| My guardians, and Ms. Shelton's here as a guardian this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2440)|
| 0:40:43| She's one of our usual guardians, and I have some very dedicated employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2443)|
| 0:40:47| They're not getting paid by the state until August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2447)|
| 0:40:50| The state's out of money to pay their claims.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2450)|
| 0:40:53| Then at the end of last month, I get a call from Ms. Quist saying we're out of money to pay them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2453)|
| 0:40:59| and it's going to be very difficult for me to keep guardians active and working in the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2459)|
| 0:41:05| I don't know if the Knox County claims are being argued,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2465)|
| 0:41:07| but it's account number 1002710 in the juvenile clerk's accounting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2467)|
| 0:41:15| and I would appreciate it if you'd please pay attention to that when you're looking at her department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2475)|
| 0:41:21| It's very important to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2481)|
| 0:41:22| It's not in my budget, but it's very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2482)|
| 0:41:25| Obviously, if we're seeing that many more people, we have to use that many more attorneys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2485)|
| 0:41:30| and we're doing it with the same number of folks serving the court as we did last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2490)|
| 0:41:35| I'm confident my people are working very hard, and we're not wasting your resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2495)|
| 0:41:40| I'd be glad to take your questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2500)|
| 0:41:42| I see Commissioner Lambert has one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2502)|
| 0:41:44| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2504)|
| 0:41:46| Yeah, I was curious on the kids that need to be committed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2506)|
| 0:41:51| Is there anything that this body can do so that the kids that have parents that have insurance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2511)|
| 0:41:59| where private insurance could help pay for their care, or is it just simply that it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2519)|
| 0:42:04| We release them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2524)|
| 0:42:05| If they come up with an alternative, a place to go that's secure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2525)|
| 0:42:10| we release them immediately to a private carrier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2530)|
| 0:42:12| We'll transport them there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2532)|
| 0:42:13| We're working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2533)|
| 0:42:14| That's how we've been doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2534)|
| 0:42:16| We have been committing kids to the department, making them do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2536)|
| 0:42:19| We have been using private care, but I'm afraid I'm going to get between a rock and a hard place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2539)|
| 0:42:25| and the way that's going to happen is I'm going to have a family with nothing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2545)|
| 0:42:28| and they're going to come in with a kid and say, I can't do this anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2548)|
| 0:42:32| He's crazy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2552)|
| 0:42:33| And the kid really hadn't committed a felony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2553)|
| 0:42:35| He hadn't done anything where I could put him in detention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2555)|
| 0:42:38| When I get in that perfect storm situation, I've got nowhere to send them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2558)|
| 0:42:42| and I don't have a dollar to send them anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2562)|
| 0:42:45| And I'd like to have at least three of those a year just to back me up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2565)|
| 0:42:50| and promise not to use it unless I get that perfect storm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2570)|
| 0:42:53| I kept waiting on the legislature to fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2573)|
| 0:42:55| We were promised they would fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2575)|
| 0:42:57| They haven't fixed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2577)|
| 0:42:58| They came up with an outpatient solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2578)|
| 0:43:01| I'm talking about kids that need to be hospitalized right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2581)|
| 0:43:06| We just met with the Helen Ross McNabb folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2586)|
| 0:43:09| and we're going to do everything outpatient that we can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2589)|
| 0:43:12| but I'm going to hit that perfect storm situation, and I'm going to take care of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2592)|
| 0:43:16| but I'm not going to be able to pay my bills when it happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2596)|
| 0:43:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2599)|
| 0:43:20| Well, just let us know what we can do to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2600)|
| 0:43:22| Probably consider $30,000 in medical services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2602)|
| 0:43:26| And I hate to spring that on you this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2606)|
| 0:43:28| I haven't even run it by John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2608)|
| 0:43:30| I thought this was going to be fixed in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2610)|
| 0:43:32| I don't think anything is going to be fixed in Nashville right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2612)|
| 0:43:37| Hey, politics is hard to fix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2617)|
| 0:43:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2620)|
| 0:43:41| Are you done, Commissioner Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2621)|
| 0:43:43| Yeah, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2623)|
| 0:43:44| If you'll just get that written up, I'll propose that when we pass the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2624)|
| 0:43:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2628)|
| 0:43:49| And then the other thing is please, please try to get my guardians paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2629)|
| 0:43:54| Their fund was $85,000 requested in 10 and $65,000 proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2634)|
| 0:44:00| We ran out in April last year with $65,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2640)|
| 0:44:04| And I can't do anything about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2644)|
| 0:44:06| The statutes tell me when I have to appoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2646)|
| 0:44:09| and I'll have to keep appointing even though we're out of money until June 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2649)|
| 0:44:13| Yes, I don't know who was next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2653)|
| 0:44:16| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2656)|
| 0:44:18| Tim, real quick, do you ñ I don't have this here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2658)|
| 0:44:21| I can't find it real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2661)|
| 0:44:22| Do you get a travel allowance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2662)|
| 0:44:24| We get a small travel allowance for the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2664)|
| 0:44:27| I don't get one personally, I don't think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2667)|
| 0:44:30| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2670)|
| 0:44:31| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2671)|
| 0:44:32| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2672)|
| 0:44:33| Because I think other judges do get ñ they do get a travel allowance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2673)|
| 0:44:37| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2677)|
| 0:44:38| We don't ñ I don't think ñ we have some old cars, but we don't have a travel allowance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2678)|
| 0:44:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2682)|
| 0:44:43| That's his uncle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2683)|
| 0:44:44| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2684)|
| 0:44:45| Thank you, Tim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2685)|
| 0:44:46| Commissioner Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2686)|
| 0:44:47| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2687)|
| 0:44:49| John, I want to look at this item, the line item that the judge recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2689)|
| 0:44:56| In unfairness to John, I haven't been able to spring this on him yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2696)|
| 0:45:00| I mean, he's getting ambushed by me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2700)|
| 0:45:02| Well, because there is ñ it looks like adequate funds, at least budgeted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2702)|
| 0:45:07| Can you kind of elaborate on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2707)|
| 0:45:09| Well, I'd also like to mention as far as this year's budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2709)|
| 0:45:13| we've been working with Kathy Quist's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2713)|
| 0:45:15| We think that Kathy Quist's office and the office overall would have enough to make it through to June 30th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2715)|
| 0:45:20| and make sure that the judge can do what he needs to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2720)|
| 0:45:24| And we're happy to work with the judge on the details of this budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2724)|
| 0:45:29| because we've worked through a whole bunch of details already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2729)|
| 0:45:32| And just to have two left, I feel pretty good about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2732)|
| 0:45:35| This is not ñ this isn't in my budget, the guardian ad litem money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2735)|
| 0:45:39| It's not in my budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2739)|
| 0:45:41| It's in the clerk's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2741)|
| 0:45:42| It affects me because I get the call from the clerk saying, hey, we're out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2742)|
| 0:45:47| and I've got two months left and still got guardians to appoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2747)|
| 0:45:50| When a family comes in and you take their children away and they're indigent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2750)|
| 0:45:55| they get a guardian ad litem appointed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2755)|
| 0:45:57| and they get an advocate counsel appointed on our dime or the state's dime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2757)|
| 0:46:03| Or in a delinquent case, when you find out the reason for the delinquency is deplorable conditions of the home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2763)|
| 0:46:10| you have to appoint a guardian, and Knox County has to pay for that one by law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2770)|
| 0:46:15| And it would handcuff me to not have my guardians to work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2775)|
| 0:46:19| I'm going to continue to appoint them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2779)|
| 0:46:21| I have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2781)|
| 0:46:22| I can't be a judge and not follow the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2782)|
| 0:46:24| Well, Mr. Chairman, I'd just like everyone to know that we'll be glad to work with the judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2784)|
| 0:46:29| He needs to do what he needs to do, and we'll make sure the funding is there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2789)|
| 0:46:32| and work with the clerk's office on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2792)|
| 0:46:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2794)|
| 0:46:35| Thank you, Judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2795)|
| 0:46:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2796)|
| 0:46:37| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2797)|
| 0:46:38| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2798)|
| 0:46:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2799)|
| 0:46:40| Okay, we're moving on with the law director, Bill Lockett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2800)|
| 0:46:48| And you can be as brief as you wish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2808)|
| 0:46:51| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2811)|
| 0:46:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2815)|
| 0:46:56| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2816)|
| 0:46:58| Sorry, Bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2818)|
| 0:46:59| It's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2819)|
| 0:47:00| In that case, I'll go into my presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2820)|
| 0:47:02| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2822)|
| 0:47:03| Please don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2823)|
| 0:47:04| All I'm asking about is I was looking at the light items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2824)|
| 0:47:07| and our budgeting for outside legal fees had gone from $350,000 down to zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2827)|
| 0:47:14| I hope that's true, but considering past experience, is that a prudent activity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2834)|
| 0:47:20| I'll let the finance department explain that in more detail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2840)|
| 0:47:24| but there's going to be a structural change in how outside legal counsel is funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2844)|
| 0:47:32| In years past, the law department has received an appropriation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2852)|
| 0:47:37| and we would oversee that when outside counsel was required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2857)|
| 0:47:45| Outside counsel would send bills to our office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2865)|
| 0:47:48| That process will continue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2868)|
| 0:47:50| but it's my understanding in discussions with the finance director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2870)|
| 0:47:54| and I think this is a good idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2874)|
| 0:47:56| that the budgeting and the appropriations for outside legal counsel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2876)|
| 0:48:01| are now going to come from the department that is being represented by outside counsel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2881)|
| 0:48:11| in order to, I think, better reflect and be able to report where those needs are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2891)|
| 0:48:18| Are the odds pretty good that department would be us, commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2898)|
| 0:48:23| Well, so far, we've been able to avoid that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2903)|
| 0:48:26| and we hope to continue that going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2906)|
| 0:48:33| Is there anything you'd like to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2913)|
| 0:48:36| Well, I would like to say that thanks to my staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2916)|
| 0:48:44| we have been able to avoid some of the litigation that the county has experienced in years past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2924)|
| 0:48:51| We hope that we can continue that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2931)|
| 0:48:54| As far as cost cutting, we're always looking for ways to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2934)|
| 0:48:59| When I took office, we looked at a couple of things off the bat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2939)|
| 0:49:02| where oftentimes there can be some savings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2942)|
| 0:49:05| and that's in library resources that we use in the office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2945)|
| 0:49:11| that we have to have in order to do our job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2951)|
| 0:49:14| But we did a survey and found that there were several publications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2954)|
| 0:49:18| that we were paying subscriptions for that were rarely used,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2958)|
| 0:49:21| so we cut those and saved about $4,000 annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2961)|
| 0:49:26| And we switched our online research from Westlaw to Lexis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2966)|
| 0:49:31| and have basically the same coverage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2971)|
| 0:49:33| but we're able to achieve an annual savings depending on usage between $12,000 and $15,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2973)|
| 0:49:41| One initiative that we're undertaking that has been in the planning stage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2981)|
| 0:49:47| and the research stage for several months now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2987)|
| 0:49:49| and we hope to be able to roll it out soon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2989)|
| 0:49:51| is that collections for some of the clerk's offices, which have been down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2991)|
| 0:49:57| which obviously hurts them and hurts the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=2997)|
| 0:50:01| we are going to assume responsibility for collecting those uncollected court costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3001)|
| 0:50:08| So those are some of the things we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3008)|
| 0:50:12| This body, probably better than any other in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3012)|
| 0:50:16| knows the various things that our office does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3016)|
| 0:50:21| And in terms of real growth in our budget, there's not any this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3021)|
| 0:50:26| I think overall if you take out the legal services, the operational budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3026)|
| 0:50:31| there's an increase over last year of about $5,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3031)|
| 0:50:37| and that's an increase that's actually mandated by law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3037)|
| 0:50:42| So we're attempting to not have any growth in our operational budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3042)|
| 0:50:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3051)|
| 0:50:52| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3052)|
| 0:50:54| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3054)|
| 0:50:56| Bill, vehicles in your department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3056)|
| 0:50:58| I know Becky's got one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3058)|
| 0:50:59| I think she needs to have a vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3059)|
| 0:51:01| Anybody else got vehicles in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3061)|
| 0:51:02| I have a vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3062)|
| 0:51:04| Other than that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3064)|
| 0:51:05| There are none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3065)|
| 0:51:07| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3067)|
| 0:51:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3068)|
| 0:51:10| No more lights?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3070)|
| 0:51:11| No other lights?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3071)|
| 0:51:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3072)|
| 0:51:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3073)|
| 0:51:15| And I know as this process continues, if you have any other questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3075)|
| 0:51:20| We know where to find you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3080)|
| 0:51:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3081)|
| 0:51:25| Usually right here to my right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3085)|
| 0:51:28| Register D, Sherry Witt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3088)|
| 0:51:34| Accompanied by my office manager, Richard Beeler, and my chief deputy, Nick McBride.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3094)|
| 0:51:39| Thank you, Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3099)|
| 0:51:40| I really didn't have a prepared speech.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3100)|
| 0:51:42| I really came to just answer any questions that you might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3102)|
| 0:51:45| My budget is relatively simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3105)|
| 0:51:48| We've cut 8% out of what I'm able to cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3108)|
| 0:51:53| We didn't just start worrying about things when times got tough and the economy dropped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3113)|
| 0:51:59| In the registrar's office, we try to hold the line, and I had 27 employees when I came in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3119)|
| 0:52:04| I have 23 now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3124)|
| 0:52:06| Anything else that you want to ask questions about, I'd be glad to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3126)|
| 0:52:10| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3130)|
| 0:52:12| Ms. Witt, what do you pay for rent to the PBA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3132)|
| 0:52:14| It's about $134,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3134)|
| 0:52:17| Do you know how many square feet you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3137)|
| 0:52:21| No. I'll ask the property assessor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3141)|
| 0:52:24| I don't measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3144)|
| 0:52:28| Mr. Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3148)|
| 0:52:30| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3150)|
| 0:52:31| I notice there is an adjustment or something in the Register of Deeds data processing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3151)|
| 0:52:36| What is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3156)|
| 0:52:38| The adjustment in the data processing is went from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3158)|
| 0:52:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3164)|
| 0:52:45| I'd just like to pipe in a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3165)|
| 0:52:47| The Register of Deeds through state law collects a separate fee that's dedicated just to their office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3167)|
| 0:52:52| just for data processing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3172)|
| 0:52:54| and what we're providing for in this budget is to allow the Register of Deeds to be able to spend that money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3174)|
| 0:52:59| that's already been collected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3179)|
| 0:53:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3182)|
| 0:53:04| Mr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3184)|
| 0:53:05| Just very quickly a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3185)|
| 0:53:08| One, you handle your own P cards also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3188)|
| 0:53:11| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3191)|
| 0:53:12| Well, it comes out of finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3192)|
| 0:53:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3194)|
| 0:53:15| I guess my question is, and it was the same thing I could have asked the county clerk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3195)|
| 0:53:19| is that one of the advantages of centralizing the purchasing cards is that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3199)|
| 0:53:26| and the purchasing department can look countywide at what's being purchased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3206)|
| 0:53:31| and perhaps buy things in bulk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3211)|
| 0:53:35| Are you, and at great savings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3215)|
| 0:53:38| and also if there's a certain number of, let's say, printers for the computers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3218)|
| 0:53:42| is that they can put out bids for that rather than each office buying those individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3222)|
| 0:53:47| Has any thought been given in the different fee offices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3227)|
| 0:53:50| or these other offices that aren't under the county's purchasing card at looking at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3230)|
| 0:53:56| to see if we could save the county money that way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3236)|
| 0:53:59| I guess what my question is, what are the advantages of keeping it completely in-house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3239)|
| 0:54:04| and not taking the advantages of size?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3244)|
| 0:54:07| We don't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3247)|
| 0:54:08| We go through finance purchasing on all of that, and we do buy in bulk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3248)|
| 0:54:14| So what I mean, though, are your purchasing cards handled yourself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3254)|
| 0:54:18| or do you not use purchasing cards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3258)|
| 0:54:20| We have a purchasing card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3260)|
| 0:54:22| Now, for anything like an immediate purchase or if we're out of toner or something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3262)|
| 0:54:28| it allows us to go to Walmart or wherever is, you know, Office Depot to do things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3268)|
| 0:54:34| I check those purchasing cards purchases every month on very small things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3274)|
| 0:54:38| usually for anything that's over any significant amount we go through purchasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3278)|
| 0:54:45| And some of the other offices have turned their payroll over to the county payroll system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3285)|
| 0:54:50| Have you done that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3290)|
| 0:54:51| I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3291)|
| 0:54:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3292)|
| 0:54:53| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3293)|
| 0:54:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3294)|
| 0:54:55| Mr. Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3295)|
| 0:54:57| I guess this is for John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3297)|
| 0:54:59| John, on this data processing here, it went from $66,896 to $150,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3299)|
| 0:55:06| Now, is that fees that they've collected?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3306)|
| 0:55:08| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3308)|
| 0:55:09| This is a special fee that was allowed through the state legislature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3309)|
| 0:55:12| and it was collected by the Register of Deeds Office for the Register of Deeds Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3312)|
| 0:55:15| To be used for what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3315)|
| 0:55:17| Data processing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3317)|
| 0:55:18| I mean, they have plenty of software and computer needs, very sophisticated systems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3318)|
| 0:55:22| and this is just part of how she's able to provide her services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3322)|
| 0:55:27| But it will be earmarked for that only?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3327)|
| 0:55:29| It's earmarked for that only, and that's why we have a separate line item, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3329)|
| 0:55:35| Any further questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3335)|
| 0:55:39| Sherry, in a year, how much do you travel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3339)|
| 0:55:41| I know you go to Nashville for different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3341)|
| 0:55:43| How many times a year are there things that you have to do nationally that you go to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3343)|
| 0:55:48| Our travel budget has been cut significantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3348)|
| 0:55:51| We're not traveling, you know, for educational purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3351)|
| 0:55:54| In the past, we have, but we just haven't been going anywhere because we just didn't feel like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3354)|
| 0:55:59| We put the travel in there, and we have the continued education that we try to send different employees to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3359)|
| 0:56:09| but we just haven't been able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3369)|
| 0:56:11| We've been trying to take advantage of anything that's offered here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3371)|
| 0:56:15| How many people in your office have to do this continued education?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3375)|
| 0:56:18| I think there's seven now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3378)|
| 0:56:20| Seven, I think, that are public certified administrators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3380)|
| 0:56:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3388)|
| 0:56:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3389)|
| 0:56:32| Next, we have Property Assessor Phil Ballard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3392)|
| 0:56:45| Good morning, Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3405)|
| 0:56:49| I guess the real emphasis on my budget is going to be technology training and certifications and stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3409)|
| 0:56:57| and I'm not quite prepared as I would like to be because me and John Troyer sort of took him out to a meeting here the other day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3417)|
| 0:57:08| when it was my appointment, so whoever that may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3428)|
| 0:57:13| But one of the big things that's just come up here in the last couple of weeks is that the computer system that we use through Sigma| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3433)|
| 0:57:23| is basically it's been in-house since 1993 and 1994.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3443)|
| 0:57:28| It's been bought two or three times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3448)|
| 0:57:30| It's been phased out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3450)|
| 0:57:32| We just got a letter that they're going to only support two of the things they've typically supported in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3452)|
| 0:57:39| and what we were going to do is sort of put a Band-Aid on it, which was $37,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3459)|
| 0:57:45| to try to get us through to the next budget year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3465)|
| 0:57:49| But it looks like that we're going to have to have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3469)|
| 0:57:51| My vision is maybe come back in February, March, because we need to look at other options, other systems now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3471)|
| 0:57:59| and maybe bid something like that out so that we don't have to make any payments until the following budget year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3479)|
| 0:58:08| But to give you an idea on that, the system that's being phased out, their jump-in cost is around $494,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3488)|
| 0:58:16| so you'll be looking at excess of $600,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3496)|
| 0:58:21| Now, why is that a little bit important?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3501)|
| 0:58:23| Because, you know, we're getting glitches in the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3503)|
| 0:58:28| If you submit a four-year plan to the state to look at all the properties within a four-year cycle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3508)|
| 0:58:33| most of it's done in the three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3513)|
| 0:58:35| Reappraisal goes on all that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3515)|
| 0:58:37| so basically we have to look at 60,000 properties in one year and 5,000 a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3517)|
| 0:58:43| So all this data that we could be getting and storing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3523)|
| 0:58:46| and maintaining is just sort of low and we're going to have to keep it on the records that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3526)|
| 0:58:51| So that's a major expense that, you know, that the system has served Knox County well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3531)|
| 0:58:58| but it's really not going to be available to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3538)|
| 0:59:01| It has a lot of limitations in regards to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3541)|
| 0:59:04| We can't put pictures on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3544)|
| 0:59:06| I can't track sales all four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3546)|
| 0:59:08| I can't bring down comparables that a lot of the other counties our size has for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3548)|
| 0:59:14| So I'm still working with Dick and John and we're trying to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3554)|
| 0:59:17| because then that gets into personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3557)|
| 0:59:20| You know, you can't hire people and not train them or have them sit on two systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3560)|
| 0:59:26| But I don't think I should have to say a lot that we have to have enough people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3566)|
| 0:59:34| to look at all the properties in this four-year cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3574)|
| 0:59:38| Basically, we've got 45 or 46 people today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3578)|
| 0:59:42| We had 50, but it's time to rehire those and probably two more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3582)|
| 0:59:46| What I think is it would take 55 to 58, but I think with the help of Dick Moran,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3586)|
| 0:59:52| we can work a little smarter, more efficient, and probably get those looked at with 52,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3592)|
| 0:59:57| which would just be a modest increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3597)|
| 0:59:59| Also, there's a statute that applies to that that gives a little bit of direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3599)|
| 1:00:04| and sense in that for every 4,500 parcels, I should have an employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3604)|
| 1:00:10| if approved by the legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3610)|
| 1:00:13| And that would be 46 today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3613)|
| 1:00:16| But to give you an example, Nashville would be around 52, 53.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3616)|
| 1:00:19| They have 88 employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3619)|
| 1:00:21| They have a $7.8 million budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3621)|
| 1:00:25| Chattanooga has got 50,000 less parcels in a million-dollar budget more than we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3625)|
| 1:00:30| And we do it for about $12.89 of parcels, where theirs is 20 and 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3630)|
| 1:00:36| So we've almost reached the point here that we've become so conservative that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3636)|
| 1:00:43| we're going to have to push forward just a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3643)|
| 1:00:45| Now, we're not talking about busting the budget or anything like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3645)|
| 1:00:48| but it might cost a little bit more than the previous budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3648)|
| 1:00:53| And then the training, what I have done on training, we hear about the certification so much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3653)|
| 1:00:58| that we've got eight in the chute, including me, the first week in March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3658)|
| 1:01:02| And then the first week in August, we're putting 15 more at the state building here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3662)|
| 1:01:09| And what I have done is committed to the state, and they have committed to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3669)|
| 1:01:14| they will bring as many classes here to Knoxville as they can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3674)|
| 1:01:17| but we will have to go once or maybe twice a year down there to continue with the education programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3677)|
| 1:01:23| We also will have to have a little bit of incentive for these guys because the state gives $750| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3683)|
| 1:01:29| when they complete that level of certification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3689)|
| 1:01:33| And that's for the first two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3693)|
| 1:01:36| After they get to the third level, then the state takes over with additional monies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3696)|
| 1:01:40| the third, fourth, and fifth level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3700)|
| 1:01:42| But, you know, that's pretty cheap considering that I can't hire a certified guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3702)|
| 1:01:47| That's a $1,300 investment when it would take $60,000, between $60,000 and $110,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3707)|
| 1:01:54| to hire a two-year or to hire a real estate certified appraiser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3714)|
| 1:01:59| So my only two options on that, if certification bothers you, I've either got to hire them or I've got to grow them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3719)|
| 1:02:07| And if I hire five, that's $350,000 to $400,000 when you start adding in benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3727)|
| 1:02:12| So it's to our advantage to grow our own, and I think $1,300 as they complete the two courses is just a very modest investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3732)|
| 1:02:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3741)|
| 1:02:22| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3742)|
| 1:02:23| Mr. Ballard, do you know how much rent you're paying PBA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3743)|
| 1:02:27| I think last year it was $149,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3747)|
| 1:02:29| Now, we've cut some space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3749)|
| 1:02:31| I don't know what sort of adjustment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3751)|
| 1:02:32| You're assessed a value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3752)|
| 1:02:34| I don't know that it goes by square footage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3754)|
| 1:02:36| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3756)|
| 1:02:37| It does go by square footage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3757)|
| 1:02:38| It does?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3758)|
| 1:02:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3759)|
| 1:02:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3760)|
| 1:02:42| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3762)|
| 1:02:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3765)|
| 1:02:46| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3766)|
| 1:02:50| And now we have the Knox County Trustee, Fred Sisk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3770)|
| 1:03:03| Good morning, Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3783)|
| 1:03:05| I'm here to answer any questions that you may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3785)|
| 1:03:10| Do we have any questions for the Trustee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3790)|
| 1:03:14| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3794)|
| 1:03:16| Fred, we talked about satellite offices a little earlier with Mr. Arnett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3796)|
| 1:03:20| How are your satellite office numbers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3800)|
| 1:03:23| Do you feel that we're where we should be in our satellite offices?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3803)|
| 1:03:30| The short answer is yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3810)|
| 1:03:32| And allow me to explain why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3812)|
| 1:03:35| The Trustee's Office this year, we've already collected over $200 million in property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3815)|
| 1:03:40| Over $25 million of that have come through our satellite offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3820)|
| 1:03:44| But in addition to that, our satellite offices are a focus for the citizens that are on the senior tax freeze| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3824)|
| 1:03:53| and the senior tax relief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3833)|
| 1:03:55| They come to those offices when it requires about 15 to 20 minutes to fill out an application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3835)|
| 1:04:01| Without those satellites in places, those people would have to come downtown and we'd just be absolutely swamped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3841)|
| 1:04:08| Another thing, because we're open during the summer and the period for filling in and out begins in June,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3848)|
| 1:04:16| they can do that over the summer and it makes the flow much, much smoother.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3856)|
| 1:04:21| What's the deadline for the tax freeze?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3861)|
| 1:04:23| June to what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3863)|
| 1:04:24| June through April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3864)|
| 1:04:26| This year it was April 6th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3866)|
| 1:04:28| Sixth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3868)|
| 1:04:29| So the tax freeze runs out and they can apply all year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3869)|
| 1:04:33| They can apply all year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3873)|
| 1:04:35| Do they have to reapply?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3875)|
| 1:04:36| Every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3876)|
| 1:04:38| And right now that's just the way the state's got it set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3878)|
| 1:04:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3883)|
| 1:04:44| Mr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3884)|
| 1:04:46| First of all, I want to compliment you for not giving a long speech and trying to get us back on time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3886)|
| 1:04:53| I think that's good when we're running behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3893)|
| 1:04:55| I have just a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3895)|
| 1:04:57| How many full-time and how many part-time employees do you have now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3897)|
| 1:05:01| I believe we've got 29 full-time employees and 14 part-time employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3901)|
| 1:05:06| And the reason you have more part-time employees than some of the other departments is because, to a certain degree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3906)|
| 1:05:12| your work is seasonal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3912)|
| 1:05:14| It can be, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3914)|
| 1:05:16| Because of the tax structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3916)|
| 1:05:17| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3917)|
| 1:05:18| The next question I have deals with the purchasing cards, the P cards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3918)|
| 1:05:23| How many of those does your department have or your section have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3923)|
| 1:05:27| None.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3927)|
| 1:05:28| None.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3928)|
| 1:05:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3929)|
| 1:05:30| And then the other question that comes up from time to time is the contracting that you do for collecting delinquent taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3930)|
| 1:05:37| If I recall, I think when the law director was running for office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3937)|
| 1:05:40| he thought that some of that could be handled out of his office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3940)|
| 1:05:43| And what's your position?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3943)|
| 1:05:45| Because I know we pay a lot of fees to the attorneys that collect those taxes on outside contracting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3945)|
| 1:05:52| And why do we need to do outside contracting for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3952)|
| 1:05:56| And is that something that we could do in-house, even if we had to increase the law director's budget up some?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3956)|
| 1:06:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3962)|
| 1:06:03| First of all, Knox County does not pay the attorney's fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3963)|
| 1:06:06| The attorney's fees are paid by delinquent taxpayers when they pay their delinquent taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3966)|
| 1:06:11| But secondly, you know, that is something that we are looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3971)|
| 1:06:16| You know, right now we're under contract for outside legal services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3976)|
| 1:06:22| About how much of those is that outside contractor paid every year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3982)|
| 1:06:28| I believe this year it's going to be somewhere in the vicinity of $275,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3988)|
| 1:06:32| Is that about what it's been in the last three or four years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3992)|
| 1:06:35| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3995)|
| 1:06:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=3996)|
| 1:06:41| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4001)|
| 1:06:47| Grade A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4007)|
| 1:06:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4009)|
| 1:06:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4011)|
| 1:06:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4012)|
| 1:06:54| Next we have community development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4014)|
| 1:06:56| That would be Eric Hoagland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4016)|
| 1:07:01| Good morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4021)|
| 1:07:02| I didn't really prepare anything as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4022)|
| 1:07:05| I'm just kind of here to answer questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4025)|
| 1:07:07| So you're satisfied with your budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4027)|
| 1:07:08| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4028)|
| 1:07:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4029)|
| 1:07:11| Do we have any questions for Eric?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4031)|
| 1:07:13| Good job, Eric.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4033)|
| 1:07:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4034)|
| 1:07:18| Seeing none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4038)|
| 1:07:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4040)|
| 1:07:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4043)|
| 1:07:26| Eric, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4046)|
| 1:07:31| In these community grants under the process, citizen review panel and everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4051)|
| 1:07:39| a couple of us had asked that the top, at least the top two salaries in each of these organizations be submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4059)|
| 1:07:48| Were they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4068)|
| 1:07:49| And are they available to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4069)|
| 1:07:52| Yeah, I believe we prepared that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4072)|
| 1:07:55| Did you receive that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4075)|
| 1:07:58| We prepared it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4078)|
| 1:07:59| Some of those agencies are all volunteer agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4079)|
| 1:08:03| We do not go back and verify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4083)|
| 1:08:05| We really have no means to verify what they actually put on that is what they're making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4085)|
| 1:08:13| But we have on every application, we have the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4093)|
| 1:08:17| We cite the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4097)|
| 1:08:18| We have a box for them to fill out with the person's title and what they're making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4098)|
| 1:08:24| But sometimes, like I said, there are all volunteer agencies out there, so they just leave that blank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4104)|
| 1:08:30| Can we get a copy of those salaries before we get into the community grants thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4110)|
| 1:08:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4114)|
| 1:08:35| We have it prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4115)|
| 1:08:36| I'll go get it and bring it down to you in five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4116)|
| 1:08:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4120)|
| 1:08:43| Mr. Mark Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4123)|
| 1:08:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4124)|
| 1:08:45| This may not be community development, but it is there in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4125)|
| 1:08:48| And if you can't answer it, maybe someone else can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4128)|
| 1:08:51| The $150,000 increase to Innovation Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4131)|
| 1:08:57| I know you're taking care of the previous matter, so perhaps you're not hearing me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4137)|
| 1:09:00| but I would like to get an answer as to why $150,000 more to Innovation Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4140)|
| 1:09:07| Does anybody nearby want to speak to that question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4147)|
| 1:09:10| If not, Herrick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4150)|
| 1:09:12| I can speak to Innovation Valley, Inc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4152)|
| 1:09:15| That is, of course, an initiative that follows on to the Jobs Now initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4155)|
| 1:09:20| And I think that that's not a community grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4160)|
| 1:09:23| That is a contracted service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4163)|
| 1:09:26| And I think that's important to note, if I can spend one minute on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4166)|
| 1:09:30| The community grant process over the last two years, when we set up the citizen panel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4170)|
| 1:09:35| we went in and looked at certain economic development items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4175)|
| 1:09:38| and also certain community service items we thought were of paramount importance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4178)|
| 1:09:43| An example is a volunteer rescue squad, high school fire department, Seymour Fire Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4183)|
| 1:09:49| Those three organizations alone are getting close to $200,000 in direct contracted services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4189)|
| 1:09:56| where they provide a service back to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4196)|
| 1:09:59| Those groups did not go before the citizen panel, nor did the Chamber of Commerce or Innovation Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4199)|
| 1:10:05| There's actually a list of several organizations that were not part of the panel discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4205)|
| 1:10:10| So when you hear in the media, which we try to correct on numerous occasions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4210)|
| 1:10:15| that the budget's been cut from $2 million to $1 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4215)|
| 1:10:18| part of that is because organizations like the Seymour Fire Department, the high school fire department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4218)|
| 1:10:25| the volunteer rescue squad were removed out of that mix and funded directly through contracted services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4225)|
| 1:10:32| So the Innovation Valley, Inc. is what used to be called Jobs Now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4232)|
| 1:10:39| And regarding that, Mike Arms, thank you for answering that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4239)|
| 1:10:42| I want to get your name in the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4242)|
| 1:10:44| Also, you might be able to answer this question better than Eric.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4244)|
| 1:10:48| When someone who's a member of the public or anyone else who's curious looks at the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4248)|
| 1:10:53| and sees a line item for legislative delegation, who is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4253)|
| 1:10:57| What is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4257)|
| 1:10:58| The legislative delegation, we have an agreement with our Knox County legislative delegation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4258)|
| 1:11:02| that we pay and help them maintain an independent office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4262)|
| 1:11:06| And that's Patsy Miller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4266)|
| 1:11:10| We pay her salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4270)|
| 1:11:11| I don't know if you know Patsy, but she basically serves as an administrative official for our delegation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4271)|
| 1:11:15| which includes three state senators and, I think, eight state reps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4275)|
| 1:11:19| So when someone from Knox County, for instance, would like to get information to their total delegation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4279)|
| 1:11:26| they will go through Patsy Miller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4286)|
| 1:11:28| Also, for instance, if we're getting ready to break ground on the Beck Cultural Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4288)|
| 1:11:33| we'll send Patsy Miller a notice and say, June 22nd is going to be the groundbreaking for Beck Cultural Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4293)|
| 1:11:40| Can you notify the delegation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4300)|
| 1:11:42| So basically that's a courtesy that Knox County taxpayers and you provide to your peers in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4302)|
| 1:11:50| I don't know if we can afford to be so courteous, but I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4310)|
| 1:11:53| And that's been an ongoing funded office as long as I've been around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4313)|
| 1:11:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4319)|
| 1:12:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4320)|
| 1:12:02| Anything else for Eric?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4322)|
| 1:12:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4326)|
| 1:12:07| Could I add one more bit of information because I know this is brought up with John Troyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4327)|
| 1:12:12| Later in the day, the mayor's office will provide directly to you a proposal to fund Second Harvest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4332)|
| 1:12:18| But one thing that we want to make sure that you're aware of, the importance of those mandatory meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4338)|
| 1:12:25| One of the commissioners just made a point that they'd like to see the salary of the top two officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4345)|
| 1:12:32| Actually, that's an ordinance that requires that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4352)|
| 1:12:36| When we have those mandatory meetings with these nonprofits, we lay out the ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4356)|
| 1:12:41| we lay out the requirements, we discuss conflict of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4361)|
| 1:12:45| We ask them to submit their board members and all their employees who may have a conflict of interest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4365)|
| 1:12:52| not only with someone who works in the mayor's office or maybe even you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4372)|
| 1:12:57| So spelling out the specifics of the requirements of those nonprofits is very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4377)|
| 1:13:04| One thing that has been overlooked for years that we got beat up on the grant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4384)|
| 1:13:08| and I'm going to read this verbatim so you'll know exactly what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4388)|
| 1:13:12| This is state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4392)|
| 1:13:15| Any nonprofit organization that desires financial assistance from the county legislative body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4395)|
| 1:13:21| or the governing body of the county shall file with the county clerk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4401)|
| 1:13:25| a copy of an annual report of its business affairs and transactions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4405)|
| 1:13:29| which includes but is not limited to an annual audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4409)|
| 1:13:33| a description of the program that serves the residents of the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4413)|
| 1:13:36| and a proposed use of the county assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4416)|
| 1:13:38| So if these nonprofits do not have that on file with the clerk and we write them a check,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4418)|
| 1:13:43| we've broken state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4423)|
| 1:13:44| That's why it was of paramount importance that these people attend these meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4424)|
| 1:13:48| that they know the rules that we're going to get beat up on if those rules are broken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4428)|
| 1:13:54| On file with the clerk, any citizen should be able to go down and see that last audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4434)|
| 1:14:00| Now, one of our issues in dealing with over 100 applications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4440)|
| 1:14:03| some of these nonprofits don't even have audits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4443)|
| 1:14:06| So we spent, you know, of those 100 applicants, we're funding 66 of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4446)|
| 1:14:11| We've been hand-holding those folks and getting them through this whole process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4451)|
| 1:14:16| so that their records will be on file, for instance, with the clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4456)|
| 1:14:19| The first and middle, even after that mandatory meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4459)|
| 1:14:22| only 11 organizations file with the clerk their required papers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4462)|
| 1:14:27| And we're not trying to be tough as a staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4467)|
| 1:14:31| We're trying to follow state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4471)|
| 1:14:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4473)|
| 1:14:34| Mr. Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4474)|
| 1:14:35| Mr. Arms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4475)|
| 1:14:37| We passed that ordinance about the salaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4477)|
| 1:14:39| You're correct on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4479)|
| 1:14:41| And he also passed a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4481)|
| 1:14:43| They're supposed to come back every quarter and tell us how they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4483)|
| 1:14:46| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4486)|
| 1:14:47| I haven't seen anybody come up here and tell us who are they reporting to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4487)|
| 1:14:53| We give you a compliance report at the end of every quarter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4493)|
| 1:14:58| I pass it around on your desk, and it's also on the county's website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4498)|
| 1:15:04| Do we have any way of checking to make sure they are doing these things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4504)|
| 1:15:07| Doing the what they're supposed to be doing with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4507)|
| 1:15:10| Oh, yeah, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4510)|
| 1:15:11| Yeah, we get those every quarter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4511)|
| 1:15:13| And, in fact, for this year's process, I think in May of 2008, you passed the ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4513)|
| 1:15:20| we brought that resolution, that compliance resolution that cleared all that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4520)|
| 1:15:24| If an agency did not do pretty much half of what we asked them to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4524)|
| 1:15:31| they weren't even considered for this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4531)|
| 1:15:33| And there was a few this year that submitted applications that we just had to throw out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4533)|
| 1:15:38| because they did not follow the compliance process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4538)|
| 1:15:41| I don't have the ‑‑ didn't commit them to memory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4541)|
| 1:15:45| But we get that out to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4545)|
| 1:15:47| We have a quarterly report every quarter, and we'll also do a final end of the year one as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4547)|
| 1:15:54| We probably need to mend that ordinance on their salaries and have the prior year also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4554)|
| 1:15:57| because I've noticed some of these people, when we fund them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4557)|
| 1:16:00| they're taking big raises in the admin departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4560)|
| 1:16:03| So I think we probably need to get to prior years from now on too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4563)|
| 1:16:07| We'll be happy to collect whatever you want us to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4567)|
| 1:16:11| Say the word and we'll do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4571)|
| 1:16:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4574)|
| 1:16:15| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4575)|
| 1:16:16| Yeah, Mike, is Second Harvest Food Bank, have they gotten in compliance with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4576)|
| 1:16:22| Have they ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4582)|
| 1:16:23| They filed their papers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4583)|
| 1:16:25| And before the day is over, we'll have a proposal to give them, to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4585)|
| 1:16:29| to fund them $50,000 out of this year's money, 2009 money, not 2010 money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4589)|
| 1:16:35| And we're going to submit that as soon as we get a piece of paper organized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4595)|
| 1:16:39| But understand the ball was dropped by Second Harvest, not by our staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4599)|
| 1:16:44| That was one thing that sort of bothered me about some of this media coverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4604)|
| 1:16:49| It looked like we were excluding Second Harvest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4609)|
| 1:16:51| I mean, we work with Second Harvest as closely as we work with Mobile Meals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4611)|
| 1:16:54| to make sure they get funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4614)|
| 1:16:56| We know their needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4616)|
| 1:16:57| But at the same time, we know the ordinances you require us to follow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4617)|
| 1:17:01| and the state law that we're required to follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4621)|
| 1:17:03| And we've had too many little blips to not follow that law to the letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4623)|
| 1:17:10| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4630)|
| 1:17:11| And, by the way, Barbara Cook, that's a major part of her job is working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4631)|
| 1:17:16| with these organizations to make sure they are in compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4636)|
| 1:17:19| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4639)|
| 1:17:20| I mean, I think it's real important that they comply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4640)|
| 1:17:24| and that we get to look at their records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4644)|
| 1:17:27| I mean, essentially, if they're funded by government, they're kind of a quasi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4647)|
| 1:17:32| It's funded by taxpayer money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4652)|
| 1:17:34| and I'm not necessarily picking on Second Harvest or any particular charity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4654)|
| 1:17:38| But I'll tell you, a lot of these nonprofits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4658)|
| 1:17:41| I've talked to people who have worked in them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4661)|
| 1:17:44| A lot of these nonprofits have very generous pay scales at the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4664)|
| 1:17:48| And, of course, I understand if you run a big organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4668)|
| 1:17:51| oftentimes you draw a big salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4671)|
| 1:17:54| But I've also talked to people who have worked for nonprofits that have said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4674)|
| 1:17:58| that the P-card issues of people using their company credit cards with nonprofits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4678)|
| 1:18:08| have been far worse than even government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4688)|
| 1:18:11| And, again, I'm not picking on any particular nonprofit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4691)|
| 1:18:15| but I'm just saying that there are abuses out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4695)|
| 1:18:19| and that's why the rules need to be followed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4699)|
| 1:18:21| And I applaud you guys for seeing that the rules were followed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4701)|
| 1:18:25| One other minor thing that I know you've been bombarded with this information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4705)|
| 1:18:28| but last year when we went to citizen panels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4708)|
| 1:18:31| some organizations submitted six and seven applications for different projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4711)|
| 1:18:35| This year we told them, limit it to three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4715)|
| 1:18:38| That way no organization is going to submit more than three projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4718)|
| 1:18:41| and the maximum amount of money we were going to give one project was $50,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4721)|
| 1:18:45| So we reeled in, because some of them were coming and asking for a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4725)|
| 1:18:50| So we said a maximum of three applications, a maximum of $50,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4730)|
| 1:18:54| So that ratcheted down the level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4734)|
| 1:18:56| and it made them to decide what's their most important projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4736)|
| 1:19:00| And, still, we received over 100 applications asking for over $3 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4740)|
| 1:19:04| We ended up funding 66 of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4744)|
| 1:19:08| And part of our job over the next year will be to monitor those 66,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4748)|
| 1:19:12| plus any others that you wish to add to that list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4752)|
| 1:19:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4759)|
| 1:19:20| Next up, Engineering Public Works, Bruce Weitzer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4760)|
| 1:19:24| I'll also be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4764)|
| 1:19:25| I'll be glad to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4765)|
| 1:19:28| Are you happy with your budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4768)|
| 1:19:29| Thrilled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4769)|
| 1:19:30| Thrilled, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4770)|
| 1:19:31| Any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4771)|
| 1:19:33| Just one quick question, Bruce, if I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4773)|
| 1:19:36| I see in the line items there's a $51,000 increase in what is called construction heavy maintenance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4776)|
| 1:19:42| in the highway bridge area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4782)|
| 1:19:44| Is there a big project coming up or some reason why that went up by that amount?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4784)|
| 1:19:48| We have several.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4788)|
| 1:19:50| The State of Tennessee inspects all our bridges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4790)|
| 1:19:52| and we have several bridges that are rated on the poor condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4792)|
| 1:19:55| We intend to remediate those bridges in the coming year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4795)|
| 1:19:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4799)|
| 1:20:01| Mr. Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4801)|
| 1:20:02| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4802)|
| 1:20:04| This may be premature, but can you say something about the stimulus money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4804)|
| 1:20:08| and where that may be allocated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4808)|
| 1:20:10| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4810)|
| 1:20:12| The only place it would really show up in our budget is in resurfacing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4812)|
| 1:20:17| There's two areas we're getting stimulus money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4817)|
| 1:20:20| We're getting about $3.1 million for a project on Lovell Road, which is actually a state project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4820)|
| 1:20:26| It does not show up in our budget, but it is a TPO regional project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4826)|
| 1:20:30| The other place is we've applied for about a half a million dollars for the resurfacing of Martin L. Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4830)|
| 1:20:35| which will help us because that would be money that we would have to spend out of our resurfacing budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4835)|
| 1:20:42| Thank you, Mr. Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4842)|
| 1:20:44| Bruce, what does this engineering trustee commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4844)|
| 1:20:48| That I don't think I can answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4848)|
| 1:20:52| I really don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4852)|
| 1:20:53| You don't know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4853)|
| 1:20:54| I see here they requested $120,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4854)|
| 1:20:59| Ann, do you or Troyer want to talk on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4859)|
| 1:21:07| Trustees' commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4867)|
| 1:21:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4868)|
| 1:21:10| There are two pieces in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4870)|
| 1:21:14| The trustees' commission is just by state law, and it's charged what it is, and that's what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4874)|
| 1:21:20| The other piece to this is the service center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4880)|
| 1:21:23| The service center bills out based on gallons of gas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4883)|
| 1:21:28| They have a premium for each gallon of gas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4888)|
| 1:21:30| They also bill out based on the work that they do for the different departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4890)|
| 1:21:35| Hourly rates, when you buy things from the service center, there's a small markup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4895)|
| 1:21:40| That markup is not enough to provide for all the service center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4900)|
| 1:21:45| and so the net effect is that it needs about a $300,000 subsidy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4905)|
| 1:21:50| and that money is included in Mr. Weitrick's budget this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4910)|
| 1:21:55| Well, what department had turned in this $120,000 that they needed requested?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4915)|
| 1:22:02| Now, I'm glad you asked that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4922)|
| 1:22:04| I'm glad to talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4924)|
| 1:22:05| I am too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4925)|
| 1:22:08| One of the things, Ann, it's good to step back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4928)|
| 1:22:11| Going into the budget process, we knew that times are hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4931)|
| 1:22:14| We knew the economy is slow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4934)|
| 1:22:17| We did not ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4937)|
| 1:22:18| The normal process would be we would have a blank sheet of paper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4938)|
| 1:22:22| and allow all the departments to say, what would you like to have, tell us what you'd want to have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4942)|
| 1:22:28| and they'd fill that out and say, here's what we would like to have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4948)|
| 1:22:32| and we'd go through a scientific process to add it all up and present that to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4952)|
| 1:22:37| This year, we did not want to give anybody false hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4957)|
| 1:22:40| We did not want to raise anybody's expectations about increased funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4960)|
| 1:22:44| We did not want to give the impression that there was more money to give,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4964)|
| 1:22:49| and so what we did is we didn't describe it as well as we could have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4969)|
| 1:22:53| but what we did is we said, we are starting with the current year's budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4973)|
| 1:22:58| and that's going into the requested column.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4978)|
| 1:23:00| We're skipping the whole requested process just to send a message that we need to be as careful as we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4980)|
| 1:23:08| on the budget right from the beginning, and I think it worked well for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4988)|
| 1:23:14| Well, in other words, what you're saying, whoever requested this $120,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=4994)|
| 1:23:20| they didn't know what they were doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5000)|
| 1:23:22| Apparently, we knew more about it or you did than they did because you've tripled it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5002)|
| 1:23:26| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5006)|
| 1:23:27| What we're saying is that we started with the current year's budget as a starting point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5007)|
| 1:23:33| and we had to make some amendments to it, and that was one amendment that we made to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5013)|
| 1:23:38| And so, you know, I think it's unfortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5018)|
| 1:23:40| It's a bad description to call it requested column.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5020)|
| 1:23:43| That's just been the way that we have presented the budget in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5023)|
| 1:23:47| but we wanted to be realistic with all the departments that there is just not money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5027)|
| 1:23:54| It's very, very tight, and we're not going to start out with the wish list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5034)|
| 1:23:58| Well, do the department heads request what they think it's going to take to run their department, John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5038)|
| 1:24:04| Generally, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5044)|
| 1:24:05| Well, should they not know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5045)|
| 1:24:09| If they don't get enough money, that's their fault for not requesting more, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5049)|
| 1:24:14| Why should we come along and give them more money than they request?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5054)|
| 1:24:17| They should know what it takes to run their department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5057)|
| 1:24:23| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5063)|
| 1:24:24| We work closely with every single department, and that's just part of this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5064)|
| 1:24:30| and I think to get hung up in the requested amount when we're just trying to hold costs down I think is unproductive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5070)|
| 1:24:43| Anything further?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5083)|
| 1:24:46| Thank you, Bruce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5086)|
| 1:24:50| Next, Mark Jones, Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5090)|
| 1:24:59| We have a budget we're submitting that I feel like is going to continue our mission at the Health Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5099)|
| 1:25:05| and I also would submit to you that it's efficient and responsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5105)|
| 1:25:12| Do we have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5112)|
| 1:25:16| How about the swine flu?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5116)|
| 1:25:17| How are we doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5117)|
| 1:25:19| We're doing really well on that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5119)|
| 1:25:21| Hopefully it will stay mild in the first wave, and the second wave will be mild.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5121)|
| 1:25:29| How many cases do we have here in Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5129)|
| 1:25:33| As of yesterday, we had eight confirmed cases, but I would suspect we may have more today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5133)|
| 1:25:41| The reporting back is going to be much more rapid, and it's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5141)|
| 1:25:48| And there's probably not going to be a vaccine anytime soon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5148)|
| 1:25:53| I don't know about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5153)|
| 1:25:54| I know the CDC is looking into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5154)|
| 1:25:58| I don't think there's been an answer whether or not there will be one available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5158)|
| 1:26:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5161)|
| 1:26:03| Any further questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5163)|
| 1:26:05| Commissioner Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5165)|
| 1:26:06| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5166)|
| 1:26:07| Just out of curiosity, have you seen your patient load increase dramatically or slightly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5167)|
| 1:26:14| Kind of tell me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5174)|
| 1:26:16| As you know, we contract for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5176)|
| 1:26:18| I'll talk about primary care, adult primary care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5178)|
| 1:26:21| and I can talk about pediatric primary care, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5181)|
| 1:26:23| The pediatric care that we do at the health department, and that case load is maxed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5183)|
| 1:26:30| So we continue to add patients, but we've seen that increase, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5190)|
| 1:26:37| Adult primary care that we contract with at Cherokee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5197)|
| 1:26:43| but we still are the screening agency, so we're very much involved in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5203)|
| 1:26:49| That has increased more than 400 since the beginning of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5209)|
| 1:26:54| So, yes, we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5214)|
| 1:27:00| Any further questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5220)|
| 1:27:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5222)|
| 1:27:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5223)|
| 1:27:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5227)|
| 1:27:08| We have human resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5228)|
| 1:27:09| Frances Fogerson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5229)|
| 1:27:14| Our budget is slightly smaller than it was last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5234)|
| 1:27:17| and that's primarily due to the discontinuance of our intern program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5237)|
| 1:27:23| However, we've actually been able to supplement that by partnering with CAC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5243)|
| 1:27:30| They are getting some stimulus money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5250)|
| 1:27:32| and so they're providing the salaries and we are providing the placements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5252)|
| 1:27:36| So we should have perhaps even a larger intern program than we had last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5256)|
| 1:27:42| but it's not Knox counting money through our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5262)|
| 1:27:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5269)|
| 1:27:50| Mark Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5270)|
| 1:27:52| Frances, I notice in terms of line items we have $1.6 million for a retirement office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5272)|
| 1:27:58| That appears to be new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5278)|
| 1:28:00| Is that just simply a different way of handling retirement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5280)|
| 1:28:04| Retirement is not in my budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5284)|
| 1:28:06| It's not in your budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5286)|
| 1:28:07| Maybe John can answer the $1.6 million for the new line item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5287)|
| 1:28:11| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5291)|
| 1:28:12| I would like to speak to that, and thank you for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5292)|
| 1:28:15| In the past, the retirement office has been funded through the investment earnings of the pension plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5295)|
| 1:28:23| the different pension plans, the school pension plan, the Knox County pension plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5303)|
| 1:28:26| and the uniformed officers pension plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5306)|
| 1:28:29| And you got a presentation from the pension actuary this year, back in January,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5309)|
| 1:28:35| saying that with the decline in the stock market there would be additional funding required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5315)|
| 1:28:40| I felt like that with that additional funding required,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5320)|
| 1:28:43| and there's money in the county's budget to provide for the retirement plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5323)|
| 1:28:48| and make them funded according to the actuary sound,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5328)|
| 1:28:54| I thought it was important in just transparency to be able to say that the retirement office is on budget now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5334)|
| 1:29:03| rather than just to be paid from the investment earnings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5343)|
| 1:29:06| If you were to look at the budget previously and say, well, where is the retirement office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5346)|
| 1:29:11| It wouldn't show up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5351)|
| 1:29:13| And I would liken it to the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5353)|
| 1:29:16| They're independent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5356)|
| 1:29:19| They have authority to run the retirement office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5359)|
| 1:29:22| The school board is independent and has authority to run the school department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5362)|
| 1:29:26| but it still comes back to the county commission for approval of its budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5366)|
| 1:29:30| And I felt like this was a good change, and I think that would be a welcome change for transparency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5370)|
| 1:29:36| I think the retirement office is well run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5376)|
| 1:29:38| I'm thankful for Kim Bennett and all the work she does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5378)|
| 1:29:41| and I participate in the retirement meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5381)|
| 1:29:46| but I think this is something that the county commission should review every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5386)|
| 1:29:50| I think that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5390)|
| 1:29:51| I think that's intellectually honest and transparent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5391)|
| 1:29:54| But I think it also, when people look at the budget this year, they should say, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5394)|
| 1:29:58| well, the pension plans used to be able to fund retirement, and now they don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5398)|
| 1:30:02| So the pension plans don't look as good as they appear on paper just because of that anomaly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5402)|
| 1:30:09| I think that's a fair statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5409)|
| 1:30:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5412)|
| 1:30:13| Well, it's an added expense to Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5413)|
| 1:30:15| so when you take a look at our overall budget from last year to this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5415)|
| 1:30:18| we've picked up an additional $1.6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5418)|
| 1:30:20| $1.6 million that used to be paid out of the pension funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5420)|
| 1:30:23| which just goes to show how badly those funds are performing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5423)|
| 1:30:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5426)|
| 1:30:27| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5427)|
| 1:30:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5428)|
| 1:30:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5429)|
| 1:30:31| Ivan Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5431)|
| 1:30:32| Francis, do you see the employee benefits insurance going up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5432)|
| 1:30:36| or what's the status on the insurance for the employee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5436)|
| 1:30:39| Well, I don't know exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5439)|
| 1:30:42| I certainly know that Knox County is paying a very good portion of that right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5442)|
| 1:30:48| and our expenses are not modest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5448)|
| 1:30:54| I just would like to remind the commission that a rate increase was recommended in this past year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5454)|
| 1:31:01| which was voted down, not by this commission, but by another board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5461)|
| 1:31:05| And so the market for health insurance is going up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5465)|
| 1:31:10| We're self-insured, and so we're only paying Knox County's claims.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5470)|
| 1:31:14| And so, you know, you can not do that on the rate side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5474)|
| 1:31:18| but eventually that's going to catch up because the cost of health insurance is just going up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5478)|
| 1:31:22| and we're going to have to take a hard look at that through the county's contribution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5482)|
| 1:31:27| the employee's contribution, and the benefit structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5487)|
| 1:31:31| and I think that will be something that we do over the summertime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5491)|
| 1:31:34| We have provided for a modest increase of about 5% on health insurance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5494)|
| 1:31:40| and so that will help lower the burden of the increase, but it's there and included in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5500)|
| 1:31:48| Maybe this question is for you, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5508)|
| 1:31:50| About the $500 bonus, a lot of people are concerned why we're giving a county employee a $500 bonus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5510)|
| 1:31:56| They're not getting an increase in funds, are they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5516)|
| 1:31:59| That's the only increase they're going to get?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5519)|
| 1:32:01| Yeah, I feel very comfortable that the Knox County employees have earned it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5521)|
| 1:32:05| We've been through this past year a hiring freeze.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5525)|
| 1:32:08| The county has successfully continued to provide services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5528)|
| 1:32:12| and I think that Knox County should be very proud about the service that the county employees do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5532)|
| 1:32:18| and I feel very comfortable that through the savings from not only the hiring freeze,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5538)|
| 1:32:24| but just through savings from the operations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5544)|
| 1:32:26| that's where we're planning to or proposing to do the $500 per employee full time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5546)|
| 1:32:33| These employees are the ones that help make those savings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5553)|
| 1:32:36| and so they should share in some of these rewards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5556)|
| 1:32:39| and I feel like you talk about somebody who has tried to address swine flu.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5559)|
| 1:32:45| You've got people who are out there on the front lines in law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5565)|
| 1:32:49| These employees have earned it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5569)|
| 1:32:52| And I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5572)|
| 1:32:55| And I agree with you, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5575)|
| 1:32:56| I think $500 is a very low bonus as far as I'm concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5576)|
| 1:33:00| I know the city employees get 2.5% increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5580)|
| 1:33:03| and I had some city employees ask me, they said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5583)|
| 1:33:05| why are you all giving the employees a $500 bonus?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5585)|
| 1:33:08| And I said, listen, first of all, they're not getting an increase in their salary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5588)|
| 1:33:11| and I don't know what a $500 increase rates to the cost of living, but it's very low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5591)|
| 1:33:17| And I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5597)|
| 1:33:18| Our county employees deserve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5598)|
| 1:33:19| I wish we could give them more, and I'd be willing to vote for more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5599)|
| 1:33:22| but I understand the budget's tight, so we just have to deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5602)|
| 1:33:25| But I do appreciate the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5605)|
| 1:33:29| John, would it be fair to say with the insurance premiums are going to go up on them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5609)|
| 1:33:34| that their actual paycheck will be less?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5614)|
| 1:33:39| Well, I think that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5619)|
| 1:33:40| Even with a $500 at the end of the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5620)|
| 1:33:42| At the end of the day, we're going to have to look at the benefit structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5622)|
| 1:33:45| and that's going to be partly paid by the county, partly paid by the employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5625)|
| 1:33:49| and so that will reduce your $500, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5629)|
| 1:33:53| But at the end of the day, their bring home could be less next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5633)|
| 1:33:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5638)|
| 1:33:59| Mr. Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5639)|
| 1:34:00| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5640)|
| 1:34:02| Frances, I think I asked you this in your office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5642)|
| 1:34:04| but are we going to propose maintaining the freeze, the hiring freeze, going into the new year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5644)|
| 1:34:10| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5650)|
| 1:34:13| Mr. Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5653)|
| 1:34:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5654)|
| 1:34:15| John, I'm not against that $500 bonus, but you're talking about the savings we made with the hiring freeze.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5655)|
| 1:34:21| I believe that was just $1.7 million, wasn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5661)|
| 1:34:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5664)|
| 1:34:25| Our goal was $1.5 million, and we've achieved that goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5665)|
| 1:34:29| But these bonuses are costing us $4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5669)|
| 1:34:31| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5671)|
| 1:34:33| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5673)|
| 1:34:34| Our number is right at $1.2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5674)|
| 1:34:37| $1.2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5677)|
| 1:34:38| $1.2 million, and that's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5678)|
| 1:34:39| So, really, we haven't saved any money when we're getting it back out in bonuses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5679)|
| 1:34:43| But I'm not against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5683)|
| 1:34:44| I think the people deserve it, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5684)|
| 1:34:46| But I just want to get it realized that we didn't save $1.7 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5686)|
| 1:34:51| It's still costing us another $3 million, I mean $200,000 or $300,000, $23,000 roughly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5691)|
| 1:34:59| But that's in lieu of a salary increase, though, that they would normally have gotten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5699)|
| 1:35:04| I mean, as a cost of living increase, this is in lieu of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5704)|
| 1:35:07| So that's what people need to understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5707)|
| 1:35:09| They're not going to get a raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5709)|
| 1:35:11| And then we're going to turn around and it's going to cost them more for their health insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5711)|
| 1:35:14| And, as Greg pointed out, some may wind up taking home less money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5714)|
| 1:35:19| But when you're out of a job out there, it's hard to say that you're paying taxes to give someone else anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5719)|
| 1:35:25| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5725)|
| 1:35:26| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5726)|
| 1:35:28| Yeah, I wanted to address the bonuses and why I support them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5728)|
| 1:35:34| You know, certainly I think it's justifiable not to have a cost of living increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5734)|
| 1:35:38| I think that right now the economy is deflationary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5738)|
| 1:35:42| And I think that if you've got a job and you've got money coming in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5742)|
| 1:35:45| you actually have more spending power than you did a year ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5745)|
| 1:35:49| And I know a lot of folks in the private sector who are making less,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5749)|
| 1:35:54| and I'll have to say I'm making considerably less in my business, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5754)|
| 1:36:00| are complaining about, you know, well, why are they getting a bonus from the taxpayers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5760)|
| 1:36:05| The thing is, is that in the private sector, most of us, or a lot of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5765)|
| 1:36:11| have the opportunity to make larger sums of money at some times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5771)|
| 1:36:16| I'll be honest, I'm losing money this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5776)|
| 1:36:19| But there have been other years that I have made very good money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5779)|
| 1:36:24| And when a person works for the government, and for the most part, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5784)|
| 1:36:29| these are middle class jobs, they're going to make the same all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5789)|
| 1:36:35| What they give up, they give up maybe the potential to make more money in the private sector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5795)|
| 1:36:41| and what they get in return is job security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5801)|
| 1:36:43| Well, times are tough, and these folks are benefiting from that job security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5803)|
| 1:36:48| But the thing that folks need to remember is that these folks also gave up other opportunities to work for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5808)|
| 1:36:56| And over the last decade, they've probably been making a lot less than folks with a similar background, similar education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5816)|
| 1:37:03| So, you know, while I don't see the need for a cost of living increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5823)|
| 1:37:08| because the cost of living has not increased,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5828)|
| 1:37:11| I don't necessarily think that a $500 bonus is out of line, so I'm going to support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5831)|
| 1:37:16| But I know to a lot of hard working self-employed folks out there, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5836)|
| 1:37:21| they're looking at this and they're saying, my, my pay has gone down, and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5841)|
| 1:37:26| county workers are getting a bonus, you know, but these folks have worked for less pay for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5846)|
| 1:37:34| And so that's why I'm supporting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5854)|
| 1:37:38| You may also keep in mind that the bonus is a one-time payment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5858)|
| 1:37:41| It doesn't add to their base pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5861)|
| 1:37:43| So should we receive percentage increases in years to come, that $500 will not be taken into account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5863)|
| 1:37:52| Commissioner Pinkston, your light was on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5872)|
| 1:37:54| Are you done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5874)|
| 1:37:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5875)|
| 1:37:56| Commissioner Mark Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5876)|
| 1:37:57| I would just like to add that some of the things Commissioner Lambert said was true,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5877)|
| 1:38:00| but one that was not is that the economy is in deflation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5880)|
| 1:38:03| I just looked at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and although price increases are down, the rate is still creeping up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5883)|
| 1:38:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5892)|
| 1:38:13| We're not going to get into a debate over economics here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5893)|
| 1:38:15| We'll debate this at another time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5895)|
| 1:38:16| But I would say that if your dollars will buy you more than they would, that's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5896)|
| 1:38:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5901)|
| 1:38:22| We're moving on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5902)|
| 1:38:24| Next up, libraries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5904)|
| 1:38:25| Larry Frank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5905)|
| 1:38:35| Larry, sure has changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5915)|
| 1:38:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5917)|
| 1:38:38| I'm Mary Palm sitting in for Larry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5918)|
| 1:38:40| He's on vacation right now on his annual leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5920)|
| 1:38:43| And we are satisfied with the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5923)|
| 1:38:45| So we would welcome any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5925)|
| 1:38:48| Do we have any questions for libraries?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5928)|
| 1:38:50| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5930)|
| 1:38:52| What is your rainy day fund, your fund balance used for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5932)|
| 1:38:57| Marita, where are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5937)|
| 1:39:01| This is Marita Brock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5941)|
| 1:39:02| She's the assistant director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5942)|
| 1:39:06| Any fund balance that we would have is calculated by the finance department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5946)|
| 1:39:15| and those decisions are made in the finance department as to how our budget is going to be funded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5955)|
| 1:39:20| and the breakout of revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5960)|
| 1:39:22| Well, you had a pretty substantial fund balance here a few years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5962)|
| 1:39:26| A few years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5966)|
| 1:39:27| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5967)|
| 1:39:28| But over the years, I believe that that's been applied to balance out the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5968)|
| 1:39:33| and I'm not quite certain that there is an expected fund balance for this year's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5973)|
| 1:39:38| I would just like to say that on page 24 of your small book,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5978)|
| 1:39:44| the proposed use of fund balance for the public library is $45,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5984)|
| 1:39:50| What I was getting around to, the library is up here quite often hollering how much they need money for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5990)|
| 1:39:56| and you've had this fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5996)|
| 1:39:59| Why were you not able to use that in the libraries instead of us taking it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=5999)|
| 1:40:04| and putting it towards the county's budget if it was your fund balance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6004)|
| 1:40:08| The library's fund balance has only been spent for the libraries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6008)|
| 1:40:11| I beg your pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6011)|
| 1:40:12| The library's fund balance has only been spent for the libraries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6012)|
| 1:40:15| Has only been spent for the libraries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6015)|
| 1:40:16| Only for the libraries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6016)|
| 1:40:19| And so it's been used to help the libraries continue to provide the services that they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6019)|
| 1:40:25| We're very happy with the library services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6025)|
| 1:40:27| We're thankful that so many people use the library services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6027)|
| 1:40:31| and we're glad to be able to do as they're able to do as much as they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6031)|
| 1:40:38| Well, I just wonder, they're always up here wanting money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6038)|
| 1:40:40| If they've had a fund balance, why haven't we been giving them some of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6040)|
| 1:40:43| I mean, apparently we haven't been putting anything in the budget from the general fund as much as they need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6043)|
| 1:40:51| because we're taking a lot of it out of their fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6051)|
| 1:40:53| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6053)|
| 1:40:54| There's been almost $11 million in the proposed budget from the general fund to the libraries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6054)|
| 1:40:59| I think that's support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6059)|
| 1:41:01| Was a lot of that money theirs from their fund balance that they hadn't used?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6061)|
| 1:41:05| No, none of it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6065)|
| 1:41:12| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6072)|
| 1:41:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6075)|
| 1:41:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6076)|
| 1:41:19| Next up, Grant Rosenberg from Office of Neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6079)|
| 1:41:35| Commissioner, our budget's very modest this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6095)|
| 1:41:39| We're actually getting $11,000 less than what we were awarded last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6099)|
| 1:41:46| And not reflected in this budget is revenue we've actually generated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6106)|
| 1:41:51| since Office of Neighborhoods took over code enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6111)|
| 1:41:55| We've generated some fees, increased the fees of the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6115)|
| 1:41:59| We've been collecting our liens and our cleanup fees and also tacking on an enforcement fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6119)|
| 1:42:04| So that's generated about $53,000, projected $53,000 a year in revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6124)|
| 1:42:10| We've collected, I want to say, about $35,000 or so this year so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6130)|
| 1:42:16| And that just goes out in the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6136)|
| 1:42:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6140)|
| 1:42:21| Do we have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6141)|
| 1:42:25| Seeing none, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6145)|
| 1:42:31| Doug Patel, Parks and Recreation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6151)|
| 1:42:35| Morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6155)|
| 1:42:37| The only real change we had in our budget was Shumpert Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6157)|
| 1:42:40| It was scheduled to be open this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6160)|
| 1:42:42| It was behind schedule on construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6162)|
| 1:42:44| which actually helped us save probably over $100,000 in the budget this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6164)|
| 1:42:49| So we'll be able to open it up this coming year on the same budgeted amounts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6169)|
| 1:42:52| and hopefully get that under budget as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6172)|
| 1:42:56| Other than that, I'll be glad to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6176)|
| 1:42:59| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6179)|
| 1:43:00| Doug, this amusement tax is going up from $76,390.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6180)|
| 1:43:07| That's what you've asked for adopted in 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6187)|
| 1:43:11| You proposed $150,000 in 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6191)|
| 1:43:18| Why has this doubled?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6198)|
| 1:43:20| Actually, that came through the finance department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6200)|
| 1:43:22| So that was an original amount a few years back and it had been cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6202)|
| 1:43:27| So I'm not too sure what the movement there was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6207)|
| 1:43:31| Now, on the capital side, though, that is really that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6211)|
| 1:43:34| And the $100,000 we have in the actual capital budget is the only money we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6214)|
| 1:43:39| for the entire park system for any renovation or construction next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6219)|
| 1:43:43| So obviously our construction renovation is going to slow down tremendously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6223)|
| 1:43:47| It will keep the ball rolling a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6227)|
| 1:43:49| but I think that might have been the finance department looking at trying to get us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6229)|
| 1:43:54| you know, just enough money to keep things moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6234)|
| 1:43:56| And that would be it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6236)|
| 1:43:58| This million dollars over, is that for the golf course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6238)|
| 1:44:02| was that what we approved several months ago or what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6242)|
| 1:44:05| A million dollars over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6245)|
| 1:44:06| I think you're getting a million dollars, I believe, over your budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6246)|
| 1:44:09| I'm thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6249)|
| 1:44:11| Let me see here just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6251)|
| 1:44:13| That's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6253)|
| 1:44:14| I'll get back to you a little later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6254)|
| 1:44:15| It could well be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6255)|
| 1:44:16| But, again, the golf course sells funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6256)|
| 1:44:18| so all the revenue comes in to pay for all the expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6258)|
| 1:44:21| No, but is this above and beyond what we appropriated here a few months ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6261)|
| 1:44:26| when we took over the golf course?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6266)|
| 1:44:28| It should be exactly the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6268)|
| 1:44:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6269)|
| 1:44:30| That's what I was trying to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6270)|
| 1:44:31| That is the million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6271)|
| 1:44:32| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6272)|
| 1:44:33| Now, this year obviously we only did six months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6273)|
| 1:44:34| so next year we'll have a full 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6274)|
| 1:44:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6275)|
| 1:44:36| That's just what I wanted to be sure it was the same million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6276)|
| 1:44:37| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6277)|
| 1:44:38| Another extra million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6278)|
| 1:44:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6279)|
| 1:44:40| Just getting back to that, John, what we have to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6280)|
| 1:44:43| we have to show the expense of the golf course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6283)|
| 1:44:47| and I'll lie, not on the expense side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6287)|
| 1:44:49| but then we have funds coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6289)|
| 1:44:51| Where do we show the revenue coming in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6291)|
| 1:44:54| If you look in your small book, it's page 11, fund 425,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6294)|
| 1:44:57| that's $1,162,000 that Commissioner Pinkston was referring to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6297)|
| 1:45:01| And so if you look year to year, it looks like a large increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6301)|
| 1:45:04| but in essence what it is is that since Doug's department has taken over the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6304)|
| 1:45:08| operations of the golf course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6308)|
| 1:45:10| they're also taking over all the revenues of the golf course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6310)|
| 1:45:13| and those fully funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6313)|
| 1:45:15| We're not proposing any tax monies to go into the golf course fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6315)|
| 1:45:19| It's only funded by their operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6319)|
| 1:45:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6321)|
| 1:45:23| Money in, money out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6323)|
| 1:45:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6325)|
| 1:45:26| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6326)|
| 1:45:27| Doug, real quick, do you know off the top of your head,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6327)|
| 1:45:30| how many people are using Shumpert Park right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6330)|
| 1:45:33| Well, right now it's not a few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6333)|
| 1:45:36| Oh, you mean just the soccer fields there now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6336)|
| 1:45:38| Gosh, the AOSO soccer fields are over 1,000 kids playing each season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6338)|
| 1:45:44| So there's 1,000 participants in there each season, spring and fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6344)|
| 1:45:48| If you can, we need to do something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6348)|
| 1:45:50| some sort of little caution light or something at that entrance right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6350)|
| 1:45:53| If you can get with Bruce and see if we could do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6353)|
| 1:45:55| not come out of your budget but lift them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6355)|
| 1:45:57| but something's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6357)|
| 1:45:59| Somebody's going to have an accident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6359)|
| 1:46:01| Yeah, there's a lot of traffic there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6361)|
| 1:46:02| If we could do that, that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6362)|
| 1:46:04| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6364)|
| 1:46:08| Thank you, Doug.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6368)|
| 1:46:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6369)|
| 1:46:11| Okay, probation, pretrial release.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6371)|
| 1:46:13| Todd Cook?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6373)|
| 1:46:18| I'd be happy to answer any questions you might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6378)|
| 1:46:20| Your bracelet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6380)|
| 1:46:21| Are you happy with your budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6381)|
| 1:46:23| Yes, same budget as last year, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6383)|
| 1:46:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6386)|
| 1:46:27| Todd?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6387)|
| 1:46:29| Commissioner Brad Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6389)|
| 1:46:31| Hey, Todd, how are we doing on the bracelets as far as being paid for by the user, I guess?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6391)|
| 1:46:40| How are those working for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6400)|
| 1:46:42| We have 16 people presently today on bracelets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6402)|
| 1:46:46| Of those 16, probably 10 of them are paid in full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6406)|
| 1:46:50| The others are making payments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6410)|
| 1:46:52| You're pretty happy with where we're going with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6412)|
| 1:46:54| Do you see room to expand it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6414)|
| 1:46:56| Oh, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6416)|
| 1:46:57| I think it's the way of the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6417)|
| 1:46:58| particularly when we start looking at jail overcrowding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6418)|
| 1:47:01| and we can put some nonviolent offenders on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6421)|
| 1:47:03| and not be responsible for their medical bills and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6423)|
| 1:47:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6427)|
| 1:47:09| Commissioner Pinkston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6429)|
| 1:47:10| Todd, you proposed your budget, I guess, didn't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6430)|
| 1:47:13| You got your budget together?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6433)|
| 1:47:14| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6434)|
| 1:47:16| You requested $1,123,129.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6436)|
| 1:47:22| But we're proposing $1,132,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6442)|
| 1:47:27| You know, I just wondered why we're giving you more than you asked for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6447)|
| 1:47:32| Do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6452)|
| 1:47:33| I think that the bracelets, we've never had a line item for bracelets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6453)|
| 1:47:42| I think that you'll see other line items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6462)|
| 1:47:47| $9,460 has never been in my budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6467)|
| 1:47:51| and that's for indigent people that the judges make court orders to put on the bracelet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6471)|
| 1:47:56| They can't afford to pay for the bracelet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6476)|
| 1:47:58| Did you know that when you proposed your budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6478)|
| 1:48:00| Well, we never know from one day to the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6480)|
| 1:48:05| how many indigent people are going to be put on a bracelet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6485)|
| 1:48:08| so that's something we worked with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6488)|
| 1:48:09| I let the finance department know about it, and they put it in my budget for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6489)|
| 1:48:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6496)|
| 1:48:17| That's not much, but I just wondered what the difference was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6497)|
| 1:48:19| Well, we never know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6499)|
| 1:48:20| I mean, sometimes all 16 or all 30,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6500)|
| 1:48:22| depending on the number we have on a bracelet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6502)|
| 1:48:25| may be paying, or we may have five that the judges have court ordered us to pay for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6505)|
| 1:48:34| Commissioner Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6514)|
| 1:48:37| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6517)|
| 1:48:38| Todd, are you all coming back into the Sheriff's Department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6518)|
| 1:48:43| There is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6523)|
| 1:48:44| They are looking at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6524)|
| 1:48:46| The Justice Committee is making some recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6526)|
| 1:48:50| We meet on a quarterly basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6530)|
| 1:48:52| and I think they're looking at moving electronic monitoring pretrial back underneath the sheriff's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6532)|
| 1:48:58| just because they're better prepared to respond to when someone cuts a bracelet off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6538)|
| 1:49:06| Appreciate it, Todd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6546)|
| 1:49:09| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6549)|
| 1:49:12| Thank you, Todd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6552)|
| 1:49:13| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6553)|
| 1:49:16| Next up, purchasing Hugh Holt, except that's not Hugh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6556)|
| 1:49:22| Close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6562)|
| 1:49:24| Mike Reeves, Knox County Purchasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6564)|
| 1:49:26| Hugh and I have reviewed the budget, and we are satisfied with the numbers that are provided for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6566)|
| 1:49:33| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6573)|
| 1:49:34| Do we have anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6574)|
| 1:49:40| Thank you, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6580)|
| 1:49:41| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6581)|
| 1:49:44| Next up, PBA, Dale Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6584)|
| 1:49:49| Does anybody here from PBA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6589)|
| 1:49:56| John, just real quick, tell us about PBA and their budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6596)|
| 1:50:00| Commissioner Anders asked me earlier this morning to provide PBA's proposed budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6600)|
| 1:50:06| and I'm going to do that for all commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6606)|
| 1:50:09| Where you see PBA's cost is generally through space cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6609)|
| 1:50:14| which is allocated based on square footage in the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6614)|
| 1:50:17| and that will just be information we'll get out to all the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6617)|
| 1:50:22| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6622)|
| 1:50:25| Was Mr. Smith invited to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6625)|
| 1:50:27| Does he know that this is a budget hearing for them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6627)|
| 1:50:31| Yeah, but he's scheduled for 1120.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6631)|
| 1:50:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6634)|
| 1:50:36| Was he that far ahead?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6636)|
| 1:50:38| We've been knocking him out, and he's the last one before we. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6638)|
| 1:50:43| We were running behind, and now we're way ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6643)|
| 1:50:46| Could I take the opportunity to ask John a couple sort of miscellaneous questions that I have on my list?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6646)|
| 1:50:52| Why don't we go ahead?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6652)|
| 1:50:54| Yes, we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6654)|
| 1:50:55| We have that pretty well scheduled for after community grants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6655)|
| 1:50:59| but we can get into that a little bit if you wish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6659)|
| 1:51:01| Can somebody call Mr. Smith's office and see if he's available now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6661)|
| 1:51:07| Okay, John, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6667)|
| 1:51:09| I noticed a $40,000 increase in the community mediation center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6669)|
| 1:51:14| and can you explain why that rather dramatic increase?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6674)|
| 1:51:17| What, $50,000, $90,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6677)|
| 1:51:20| They work with juvenile court, and I think we had two different places,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6680)|
| 1:51:24| and I think we combined it into one place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6684)|
| 1:51:29| Is that sort of a one-time increase because of the combination costs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6689)|
| 1:51:34| Yeah, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6694)|
| 1:51:35| Ian, just help me out, and it's a grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6695)|
| 1:51:38| The county provides $50,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6698)|
| 1:51:40| and there's also another $40,000 that's collected through the courts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6700)|
| 1:51:44| and so that would have been in previous years added throughout the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6704)|
| 1:51:48| and now we just went ahead and put it in at the start of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6708)|
| 1:51:51| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6711)|
| 1:51:52| And the other thing is I noticed in the criminal court clerk's office, 72,000 in savings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6712)|
| 1:51:56| which I never complain about, but I'm just curious about no more witness and jury expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6716)|
| 1:52:02| What are we doing there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6722)|
| 1:52:04| We feel that there can be some operational savings opportunities there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6724)|
| 1:52:08| and have challenged the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6728)|
| 1:52:12| I hope they respond favorably to your challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6732)|
| 1:52:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6735)|
| 1:52:18| I also notice a $1 million decrease in vehicles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6738)|
| 1:52:23| but it's not specified how that is achieved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6743)|
| 1:52:26| Is that a slowdown of purchases?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6746)|
| 1:52:28| How is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6748)|
| 1:52:30| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6750)|
| 1:52:32| The number of vehicles is at the lowest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6752)|
| 1:52:35| The presented proposed vehicles are 16 sheriff's cruisers at $27,000 apiece,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6755)|
| 1:52:41| plus one garbage truck for parks and recreation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6761)|
| 1:52:44| Those are the only vehicles that are proposed in this budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6764)|
| 1:52:47| and that is significantly cut from any previous budget in recent history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6767)|
| 1:52:54| We feel like and we share the commission's concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6774)|
| 1:52:58| We understand the commission's concern about the number of vehicles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6778)|
| 1:53:01| and I feel like the best way that the commission can look into that is to limit the new vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6781)|
| 1:53:08| So it doesn't have anything to do with currently assigned vehicles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6788)|
| 1:53:11| especially currently assigned take-home vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6791)|
| 1:53:13| It's just a slowdown of new vehicle purchases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6793)|
| 1:53:16| It's a dramatic slowdown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6796)|
| 1:53:18| I agree, but it is that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6798)|
| 1:53:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6800)|
| 1:53:21| Because I just wanted to make sure what that was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6801)|
| 1:53:24| Bright start is gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6804)|
| 1:53:27| What was the thinking there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6807)|
| 1:53:29| They do some fundraising, and we fund that through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6809)|
| 1:53:35| They're fundraising through the employee benefits fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6815)|
| 1:53:38| So they're still able to do their operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6818)|
| 1:53:41| That's the wellness program, am I right, Mark?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6821)|
| 1:53:43| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6823)|
| 1:53:44| We think that the benefits of those will also inure to the employee benefits plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6824)|
| 1:53:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6830)|
| 1:53:51| One little oddity here in the Attorney General's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6831)|
| 1:53:54| I didn't see anybody else paying for bus passes, but they paid $20 for one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6834)|
| 1:53:58| Can you explain that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6838)|
| 1:53:59| Granted, it's a small amount of money, but any idea what's going on there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6839)|
| 1:54:02| There has been a program through the Air Quality Office to encourage people to take the bus instead of driving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6842)|
| 1:54:09| to try to limit pollution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6849)|
| 1:54:11| And so this is what employees get paid to make that commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6851)|
| 1:54:16| I thank you for resolving some of the oddities I discovered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6856)|
| 1:54:21| Commissioner Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6861)|
| 1:54:23| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6863)|
| 1:54:25| John, I should have brought this up when the health department was here, but it just occurred to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6865)|
| 1:54:32| The child car seat program is not being funded this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6872)|
| 1:54:37| It's funded through collections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6877)|
| 1:54:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6879)|
| 1:54:40| So it's not a line item in the budget anymore, but it's still?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6880)|
| 1:54:44| As the money comes in, the money is spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6884)|
| 1:54:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6886)|
| 1:54:51| One more thing I forgot, John, and I'm sorry to backtrack like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6891)|
| 1:54:55| Maybe you can answer the mysterious mineral extraction fees that other counties get, but we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6895)|
| 1:55:02| Do we not have any minerals being extracted in this county, or we just simply never chose to tax it, or what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6902)|
| 1:55:07| It's my understanding that the county has never made that choice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6907)|
| 1:55:10| and I guess that would certainly be an option that the commission could choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6910)|
| 1:55:15| There are more than one, I understand, extractors in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6915)|
| 1:55:20| but it would be a small base and a small number of taxpayers that would be burdened with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6920)|
| 1:55:27| But it's something the commission could choose to do at any meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6927)|
| 1:55:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6930)|
| 1:55:37| Commissioner Broyles, your light's still on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6937)|
| 1:55:41| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6941)|
| 1:55:42| It's my understanding that Dale Smith will be here any moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6942)|
| 1:55:50| Since we're running ahead, Dwight, do you want to go ahead?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6950)|
| 1:55:54| We can go ahead and do the mayor's office now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6954)|
| 1:56:00| Would you like to go ahead and do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6960)|
| 1:56:02| That way we won't have to do it after lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6962)|
| 1:56:08| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6968)|
| 1:56:09| If I could just be allowed to speak to the handouts we just gave you briefly before we address the mayor's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6969)|
| 1:56:16| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6976)|
| 1:56:17| Actually, I hate to interrupt you, but Dale Smith just walked in the door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6977)|
| 1:56:22| and now we'll have a chance to read over it before you give your presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6982)|
| 1:56:27| But we'll go ahead and hear from him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6987)|
| 1:56:28| I'm sorry, Dwight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6988)|
| 1:56:32| Dale from PVA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6992)|
| 1:56:39| Good morning, Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=6999)|
| 1:56:40| Good morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7000)|
| 1:56:43| Sorry to catch you off guard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7003)|
| 1:56:45| We were behind, and then we got way ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7005)|
| 1:56:47| Oh, no problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7007)|
| 1:56:48| I'm lucky just because I just got back from a doctor's appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7008)|
| 1:56:54| I'll make just a couple of comments, if that's appropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7014)|
| 1:56:57| and then be glad to answer any questions I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7017)|
| 1:57:04| For the county-managed properties that we take care of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7024)|
| 1:57:08| our budgets this year were, comparing apples to apples, around $200K less than last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7028)|
| 1:57:18| The CCB budget went up about $261,000, but about $70,000 of that was increased space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7038)|
| 1:57:31| So those two things net out to be about debt even.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7051)|
| 1:57:36| Our property development department budget was level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7056)|
| 1:57:40| and the telecommunications budget for the county is actually decreased about $54,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7060)|
| 1:57:47| So net, net, everything that we have to do with you, you're right at that $54,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7067)|
| 1:57:55| about $50,000 less than last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7075)|
| 1:57:58| So with that, I'll stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7078)|
| 1:58:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7082)|
| 1:58:03| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7083)|
| 1:58:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7084)|
| 1:58:06| This issue actually came up in the ethics committee because I'm the commission's representative on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7086)|
| 1:58:11| We've had problems where we've had public meetings in this room or one of the other rooms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7091)|
| 1:58:15| and the doors have been locked, which is a violation of the sunshine law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7095)|
| 1:58:20| when the public can't attend those meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7100)|
| 1:58:23| I don't know if it's a personnel problem where there's not enough people to let people in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7103)|
| 1:58:27| I think one night there was another meeting going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7107)|
| 1:58:30| and the person at the door had to escort a handicapped person back to a different meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7110)|
| 1:58:36| But is there some way that that can be resolved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7116)|
| 1:58:39| You know, we pay prime dollars for the services that the PBA supplies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7119)|
| 1:58:46| but if citizens can't get in to attend these meetings, I think it's a very, very serious problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7126)|
| 1:58:54| Commissioner, I know of one instance that occurred, and only one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7134)|
| 1:58:59| I'd be glad, like to know if you know of more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7139)|
| 1:59:03| That involved former Commissioner DeVries, and she did make a complaint to my office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7143)|
| 1:59:10| In fact, it was that we had one security screener, the sheriff's officers had left,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7150)|
| 1:59:16| and my officer was asked to escort a handicapped person into the small assembly, which they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7156)|
| 1:59:22| What we've done is you can't afford to have more than one person for all these night, evening things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7162)|
| 1:59:29| We've had a policy we've established now that if one of our officers is requested to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7169)|
| 1:59:35| they call the comm center down at L1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7175)|
| 1:59:38| They will have somebody come up to back them up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7178)|
| 1:59:41| and so there would never be a situation where the door was unmanned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7181)|
| 1:59:46| As I looked into it, it was unmanned for about five minutes or less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7186)|
| 1:59:51| So I don't think this is a significant problem, to be honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7191)|
| 1:59:55| I think it was a one-time glitch, and I think we've taken care of that so it won't occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7195)|
| 2:00:01| I believe we've had a couple of other complaints on that, and I think I have the letters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7201)|
| 2:00:05| where people have sent those to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7205)|
| 2:00:07| I'll go back and look in my notebook that I keep from the Ethics Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7207)|
| 2:00:10| but I believe we've had three incidences altogether with that, and I'll be glad to forward those on to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7210)|
| 2:00:17| Yes, I'd appreciate it, because I'm not aware of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7217)|
| 2:00:19| I think it's a very serious problem just in compliance with the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7219)|
| 2:00:28| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7228)|
| 2:00:30| Mr. Smith, you said we had in the city county building had increased space and increased cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7230)|
| 2:00:37| What was that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7237)|
| 2:00:38| I believe all of that increase was the sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7238)|
| 2:00:42| They took over some space that we had down on L3, and they made a swap with the city MIS people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7242)|
| 2:00:50| to take over some space that Janet Wright controlled on L3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7250)|
| 2:00:54| and then they swapped some space that they vacated on L2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7254)|
| 2:00:58| But the net effect of that was an increase in space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7258)|
| 2:01:01| Increased in cost to you or empty space?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7261)|
| 2:01:04| No, an increase in cost to you because you occupy more space than you did last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7264)|
| 2:01:10| How much empty space does the building have now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7270)|
| 2:01:13| CCB, none, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7273)|
| 2:01:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7277)|
| 2:01:21| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7281)|
| 2:01:22| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7282)|
| 2:01:24| Thank you, Dale, for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7284)|
| 2:01:27| I assume you've gotten some of the e-mails that we've gotten that are critical somewhat of PBA's scope of operations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7287)|
| 2:01:38| some of their management of construction projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7298)|
| 2:01:42| Do you know which e-mails I'm referring to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7302)|
| 2:01:45| There's a Mr. Loy that sends us out stuff quite frequently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7305)|
| 2:01:50| I was just wondering if you might respond, not in a general way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7310)|
| 2:01:55| to some of his concerns about PBA here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7315)|
| 2:02:01| Commissioner, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7321)|
| 2:02:03| I've never seen anything in writing except some blog exchange that one of my staff ran across,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7323)|
| 2:02:10| so I would actually love to see any of the e-mails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7330)|
| 2:02:14| I understand he had a handout at some Republican meeting the other day or last week maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7334)|
| 2:02:20| But, one, I don't know Mr. Loy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7340)|
| 2:02:24| I've never spoken with him, neither has any one of my staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7344)|
| 2:02:28| But, basically, 100% of the things I've heard he's said are incorrect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7348)|
| 2:02:33| He's talked about the fact that we don't bid jobs or work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7353)|
| 2:02:37| And, in fact, I can absolutely prove, and I think Jeff Gallion did prove to Larry VanGelder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7357)|
| 2:02:44| that everything on that high school project and all of our projects is bid through the CM,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7364)|
| 2:02:50| if the CM construction manager is what I mean by CM, I apologize,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7370)|
| 2:02:55| wants to self-perform, they're required to bid it like everybody else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7375)|
| 2:03:00| and the bids come directly to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7380)|
| 2:03:02| My board even has a policy that I recommended, and they passed about six years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7382)|
| 2:03:08| that we competitively select every professional services organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7388)|
| 2:03:15| everything that we do is competitively selected in an open process, including architects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7395)|
| 2:03:23| And I'll tell you, when I first got here nine years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7403)|
| 2:03:27| there was a lot of consternation about how architects were being selected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7407)|
| 2:03:31| And since Commissioner, or I should say former Commissioner Larry Stevens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7411)|
| 2:03:36| who chaired what used to be the Construction Oversight Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7416)|
| 2:03:40| Larry and I worked for six months with the architectural community, established a process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7420)|
| 2:03:47| and since then I've never had a complaint about that process being unfair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7427)|
| 2:03:52| So the other things Mr. Loy seems to be going into is apparently he just recently got a certification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7432)|
| 2:04:00| to be a project manager from somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7440)|
| 2:04:05| He keeps pushing using construction manager administration delivery methods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7445)|
| 2:04:11| as opposed to construction manager at risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7451)|
| 2:04:16| We believe, and I firmly will take this up with anybody who doesn't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7456)|
| 2:04:22| that under construction manager administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7462)|
| 2:04:25| the owner actually holds all the contracts with the subcontractors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7465)|
| 2:04:30| and if there's a problem or a dispute, the owner's got to directly step in and resolve that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7470)|
| 2:04:36| as opposed to a construction manager at risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7476)|
| 2:04:39| Once we get a contract on a project on behalf of you or the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7479)|
| 2:04:46| ultimately in the process a guaranteed maximum price is established.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7486)|
| 2:04:51| All of the bidding procedures are clearly laid out that everything on that job will be bid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7491)|
| 2:04:57| as I mentioned earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7497)|
| 2:04:59| But any mistakes or problems are the general contractors to step up and resolve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7499)|
| 2:05:06| whether that be through legal means or other means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7506)|
| 2:05:09| We think there's far less risk for the owner under that approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7509)|
| 2:05:13| So that's just a few of the things I've heard him supposedly talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7513)|
| 2:05:19| Truthfully, I'm in the process of Jeff Galleon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7519)|
| 2:05:23| and I've been working on a draft to try to respond to some of those issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7523)|
| 2:05:27| because he's taken them to the state legislative members as well, and it's just baloney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7527)|
| 2:05:33| I mean, I don't know where he got his information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7533)|
| 2:05:36| but he didn't get it from us, and it isn't accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7536)|
| 2:05:42| Anything further?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7542)|
| 2:05:45| Thank you, Dale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7545)|
| 2:05:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7546)|
| 2:05:48| Dwight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7548)|
| 2:05:50| Sorry to have interrupted you before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7550)|
| 2:05:59| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7559)|
| 2:06:00| Dwight Vanderbilt for Mayor Ragsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7560)|
| 2:06:01| If I could speak first to the memo regarding second harvest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7561)|
| 2:06:06| and also to the attached table that we've distributed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7566)|
| 2:06:11| I think they'll be relevant to your discussions this afternoon as you get into community grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7571)|
| 2:06:17| The first, the memorandum from the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7577)|
| 2:06:19| simply outlines a solution to the dilemma that we face with second harvest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7579)|
| 2:06:25| It was important to the mayor to be on record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7585)|
| 2:06:27| that you understand how much he supports the work that they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7587)|
| 2:06:31| But the fact is that these were not minor technicalities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7591)|
| 2:06:36| and there is no way that we can comply with the process that's been approved by this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7596)|
| 2:06:42| and just make an outright exception for second harvest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7602)|
| 2:06:46| So this was proposed as an alternative to use $50,000 out of the money that is in this current year's budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7606)|
| 2:06:55| this would not affect next year's budget, to make second harvest whole financially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7615)|
| 2:07:01| And if I were a betting man, I would bet you they will be the first folks in with their paperwork next year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7621)|
| 2:07:06| when the grant application process starts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7626)|
| 2:07:10| So that was the first item we handed out to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7630)|
| 2:07:14| The other is just for your information, it is a snapshot of agencies that this commission has funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7634)|
| 2:07:22| Quite frankly, it was driven a little bit by this morning's editorial, to which we take some exception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7642)|
| 2:07:30| This commission has been very generous throughout the years to organizations of this nature that do good work in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7650)|
| 2:07:37| You make a substantial investment in helping them with the work that they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7657)|
| 2:07:44| We thought it would just be useful for you to have sort of a snapshot of what you have funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7664)|
| 2:07:50| We included, just to give it some context, comparative funding for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7670)|
| 2:07:55| It reflects favorably on them as well, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7675)|
| 2:07:58| It's not intended to cast anybody in a negative context,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7678)|
| 2:08:01| but just to illustrate for you that as you manage the financial affairs of the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7681)|
| 2:08:07| you are putting a lot of money forward to help these organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7687)|
| 2:08:10| So I'd be glad to answer any questions about those if you've got them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7690)|
| 2:08:14| and we'll certainly be here this afternoon as you get into the community grants discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7694)|
| 2:08:19| On our budget, briefly, we have tried to make it as uninteresting as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7699)|
| 2:08:25| Overall, it's reduced by right at $12,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7705)|
| 2:08:29| We've had a couple of the same increases as everyone else has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7709)|
| 2:08:32| Retirement and health insurance costs caused our employee benefits line item to go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7712)|
| 2:08:39| We have reflected an anticipated increase in gas and fuel costs, in supplies and materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7719)|
| 2:08:48| And other than that, we've tried to bring the top line down as much as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7728)|
| 2:08:51| Again, it's down about $12,000 from last year, and we're obviously comfortable with the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7731)|
| 2:08:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7738)|
| 2:08:59| Commissioner Mark Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7739)|
| 2:09:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7741)|
| 2:09:02| I have a question here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7742)|
| 2:09:04| The budget line item for the Mayor's Education Summit, $3.8 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7744)|
| 2:09:09| I'm just wondering at a time when we are laying off some teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7749)|
| 2:09:14| if we couldn't find a way to do a smaller, more efficient education summit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7754)|
| 2:09:19| trim that back a million or so and use it for the schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7759)|
| 2:09:23| Commissioner, I actually think that $3.8 million is the Great Schools Partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7763)|
| 2:09:27| That's the partnership with the Board of Education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7767)|
| 2:09:30| and it serves as essentially a place where new and more innovative programs can be tested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7770)|
| 2:09:38| like teacher incentive, the TAP program, birth to kindergarten, and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7778)|
| 2:09:44| The Education Summit is a very modest amount of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7784)|
| 2:09:50| Did I not read that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7790)|
| 2:09:51| I'll go back and look at it again, but I believe it was $3.8 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7791)|
| 2:09:56| That's a contribution to the Great Schools effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7796)|
| 2:09:59| So it's actually Great Schools Partnership, even though it might have been listed as Education Summit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7799)|
| 2:10:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7805)|
| 2:10:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7806)|
| 2:10:08| Fair enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7808)|
| 2:10:11| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7811)|
| 2:10:13| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7813)|
| 2:10:14| Mark, if you're interested in reallocating some Great Schools Partnership money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7814)|
| 2:10:22| directly to the school system to fund teachers, I would back you up on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7822)|
| 2:10:27| I know when the Great Schools Partnership started,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7827)|
| 2:10:30| what we were told was that local government would fund it on the front end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7830)|
| 2:10:38| and that eventually there would be private fundraising that would make up for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7838)|
| 2:10:44| And I think that what we've seen since its conception| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7844)|
| 2:10:48| is that gradually their budget gets bigger and bigger each year from county government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7848)|
| 2:10:54| and I don't think the intention was ever that it be funded through government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7854)|
| 2:10:58| So if you want to propose moving some of the Great Schools Partnership money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7858)|
| 2:11:06| directly to the school system, and if they want to give it back to Great Schools Partnership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7866)|
| 2:11:11| it would be their business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7871)|
| 2:11:13| But if you wanted to do that, I would second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7873)|
| 2:11:16| I just want to make note and interject that two years ago the amount to the Great Schools was $6.385 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7876)|
| 2:11:23| The current year is $3.823 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7883)|
| 2:11:26| and the proposed budget is exactly the same for Great Schools Partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7886)|
| 2:11:30| John, how much is the foundation going out and raising in private funds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7890)|
| 2:11:38| Every year I've asked the same question, and every year the answer is not much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7898)|
| 2:11:45| but we're going to try to do better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7905)|
| 2:11:47| Is that the same answer I'm going to get this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7907)|
| 2:11:49| I think I'd like to give the commission a full report, and we'll get it in written format.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7909)|
| 2:11:54| And I know that they would like to do more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7914)|
| 2:11:56| and I think they have worked closely with the new superintendent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7916)|
| 2:12:00| and I think their efforts will be productive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7920)|
| 2:12:04| So, yeah, we'll make sure that everybody gets a full report on the Great Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7924)|
| 2:12:08| Well, is that a plan for the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7928)|
| 2:12:12| Or have we done over this past year, have we collected funds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7932)|
| 2:12:18| Well, in the current year, the executive director left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7938)|
| 2:12:21| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7941)|
| 2:12:22| And so they've been through kind of a transition period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7942)|
| 2:12:24| and with the economy and the executive director leaving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7944)|
| 2:12:28| fundraising has not been what they would have hoped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7948)|
| 2:12:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7952)|
| 2:12:35| Any further questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7955)|
| 2:12:36| Mark Harmon, you did have your light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7956)|
| 2:12:38| I answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7958)|
| 2:12:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7959)|
| 2:12:41| Thank you, Dwight, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7961)|
| 2:12:48| We have finished all that we were going to and more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7968)|
| 2:12:51| So I appreciate commissioners for, although we fell behind at first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7971)|
| 2:12:56| I appreciate you all letting us catch back up and actually be ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7976)|
| 2:13:00| So I think we're going to go to lunch now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7980)|
| 2:13:04| Commissioner Broyles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7984)|
| 2:13:06| I just wanted to remind everyone about the Carry the Torch luncheon at the convention center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7986)|
| 2:13:11| It starts at noon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7991)|
| 2:13:12| If you go now, you might be able to take a little tour of the service providers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7992)|
| 2:13:17| that have their information set up prior to the luncheon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=7997)|
| 2:13:21| I didn't think we'd have time to do that, but it looks like we will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8001)|
| 2:13:24| So I encourage everybody to go down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8004)|
| 2:13:26| and take a look at what our homeless service providers are doing and enjoy the lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8006)|
| 2:13:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8013)|
| 2:13:36| We're adjourned until we come back and start up at 1.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8016)|
| 2:13:45| On our afternoon session here of our public hearings of the 2009-2010 budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8025)|
| 2:13:57| and next up is the Knox County Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8037)|
| 2:14:16| JJ, you've grown your hair out a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8056)|
| 2:14:18| Dyed it too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8058)|
| 2:14:25| That's a big step improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8065)|
| 2:14:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8067)|
| 2:14:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8068)|
| 2:14:30| Allison Rogers, Knox County Sheriff's Office, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8070)|
| 2:14:35| Just wanted to give you a quick brief overview of the Sheriff's Office budget before questions were asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8075)|
| 2:14:42| Our total budget did increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8082)|
| 2:14:44| Our proposed budget did increase $2.1 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8084)|
| 2:14:48| That increase is due to health insurance, retirement benefits, and the workers' comp liability fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8088)|
| 2:14:57| Our actual day-to-day operations did decrease $375,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8097)|
| 2:15:04| That decrease is mostly from fuel, $300,000 from fuel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8104)|
| 2:15:08| and then the rest was from maintenance of buildings in the corrections budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8108)|
| 2:15:13| So even though our food is increasing, our pharmacy budget is increasing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8113)|
| 2:15:16| our inmate population is increasing, our day-to-day operations is decreasing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8116)|
| 2:15:22| we feel comfortable with our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8122)|
| 2:15:25| We'll make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8125)|
| 2:15:26| We make it every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8126)|
| 2:15:28| We'll continue to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8128)|
| 2:15:31| The last thing I wanted to point out before questions, our capital budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8131)|
| 2:15:35| Last year it was $1.9 million, which funds our radios, our vehicles, our laptops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8135)|
| 2:15:41| our computers for the patrol officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8141)|
| 2:15:44| This year it is $432,000, so it has decreased substantially also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8144)|
| 2:15:50| So I just wanted to make those few points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8150)|
| 2:15:54| Are you done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8154)|
| 2:15:55| I'm done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8155)|
| 2:15:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8156)|
| 2:15:57| Do we have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8157)|
| 2:15:59| Mark Carmen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8159)|
| 2:16:01| What were the number of sworn officers in the KCSO?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8161)|
| 2:16:05| We have 475 certified officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8165)|
| 2:16:08| That's law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8168)|
| 2:16:10| As far as sworn, it's probably around 950.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8170)|
| 2:16:14| 950 sworn, that includes corrections officers also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8174)|
| 2:16:19| And total number of employees would be what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8179)|
| 2:16:22| Total number of employees is around 1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8182)|
| 2:16:25| 1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8185)|
| 2:16:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8186)|
| 2:16:27| And this question has come up before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8187)|
| 2:16:29| Have we established the number of take-home vehicles, both patrol, narcotics, and otherwise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8189)|
| 2:16:37| Total, I believe, was around 450.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8197)|
| 2:16:41| I believe that was the total number of vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8201)|
| 2:16:44| And the number assigned take-home outside of patrol?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8204)|
| 2:16:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8214)|
| 2:16:55| So those numbers are still the same?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8215)|
| 2:16:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8216)|
| 2:16:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8217)|
| 2:16:58| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8218)|
| 2:16:59| How does the number of sworn officers compare to the Department of Justice national average?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8219)|
| 2:17:06| I think Sheriff Jones will address that question or Chief Rubel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8226)|
| 2:17:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8230)|
| 2:17:16| We don't use the national justice statistics because they come from all different agencies all across the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8236)|
| 2:17:23| We don't know what duties a sheriff's office in Kentucky might do compared to what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8243)|
| 2:17:29| The best we can give you is our sister city right here in our own county, the Knoxville Police Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8249)|
| 2:17:35| And we have about, I don't know, I guess maybe 100 more, well, 75 more sworn officers than they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8255)|
| 2:17:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8267)|
| 2:17:48| That's all I needed right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8268)|
| 2:17:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8269)|
| 2:17:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8270)|
| 2:17:51| Commissioner Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8271)|
| 2:17:55| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8275)|
| 2:17:56| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8276)|
| 2:17:57| You all are getting how many new cruisers this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8277)|
| 2:18:01| 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8281)|
| 2:18:02| 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8282)|
| 2:18:03| Are you replacing cruisers that are no longer going to be on the streets?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8283)|
| 2:18:06| Those will be replaced into the fleet for vehicles that are deemed unsafe for patrol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8286)|
| 2:18:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8291)|
| 2:18:12| So none of them are actually new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8292)|
| 2:18:14| They're just replacing cars that you're taking off patrol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8294)|
| 2:18:17| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8297)|
| 2:18:18| We don't actually ever get any new vehicles, extra new vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8298)|
| 2:18:22| Every vehicle we get at some point in time is used to replace a vehicle that has become worn out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8302)|
| 2:18:28| So you're telling me that you've got 16 vehicles that are coming off the streets this year and you're going to replace them with these 16?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8308)|
| 2:18:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8314)|
| 2:18:35| These are marked vehicles, so they will come off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8315)|
| 2:18:37| They'll either be marked or unmarked, either for detectives or for patrol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8317)|
| 2:18:41| So, yes, there will be vehicles that will be replaced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8321)|
| 2:18:44| And they will be, the ones that they're replacing will be, they'll be replacing them this year, not in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8324)|
| 2:18:49| No, they'll be, well, in next budget year, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8329)|
| 2:18:53| But they'll be the oldest, the oldest in the high mileage, the cars with the most high mileage that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8333)|
| 2:18:59| That's the ones they'll replace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8339)|
| 2:19:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8341)|
| 2:19:02| So it's not really, you're not really adding 16 new cars to the fleet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8342)|
| 2:19:04| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8344)|
| 2:19:05| You're just replacing the cars that are worn out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8345)|
| 2:19:06| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8346)|
| 2:19:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8347)|
| 2:19:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8348)|
| 2:19:09| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8349)|
| 2:19:10| Will the high mileage ones be sold off by the normal university, by the normal county procedure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8350)|
| 2:19:16| They go through county procedure through HUHOLT's office, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8356)|
| 2:19:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8360)|
| 2:19:21| JJ, how much do those vehicles bring?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8361)|
| 2:19:24| Next to nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8364)|
| 2:19:26| Probably get more for them at the shredder than we get for selling them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8366)|
| 2:19:30| And I'm sure you've seen some around town with the stripes sanded off the sides of them and the spotlights on the side of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8370)|
| 2:19:36| Can I get one for my teenager?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8376)|
| 2:19:38| You sure can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8378)|
| 2:19:39| Just have to bid on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8379)|
| 2:19:41| And I don't think you can bid on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8381)|
| 2:19:43| I think that's against the procurement code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8383)|
| 2:19:47| Do we have any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8387)|
| 2:19:48| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8388)|
| 2:19:49| This is just for my information question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8389)|
| 2:19:53| Roughly how much of your budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8393)|
| 2:19:55| I think it's about $63.4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8395)|
| 2:19:58| Roughly how much does it take to run the prison out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8398)|
| 2:20:04| And roughly the 1,000 people that works in the sheriff's department, how much of that is jailing duties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8404)|
| 2:20:11| and how much of it is the rest?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8411)|
| 2:20:14| About $27 million of the budget is for corrections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8414)|
| 2:20:19| And what was the other part?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8419)|
| 2:20:21| And how does your personnel split up between corrections and the rest of the department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8421)|
| 2:20:28| We've got approximately 400, I think she said 53, sworn officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8428)|
| 2:20:33| and so that would leave roughly 480 corrections, between 480 and 500 corrections officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8433)|
| 2:20:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8440)|
| 2:20:41| So essentially everyone that's down here is a sworn, I mean is a certified or is a sworn officer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8441)|
| 2:20:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8446)|
| 2:20:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8447)|
| 2:20:48| So it's a little bit, roughly half and half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8448)|
| 2:20:51| Roughly half and half, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8451)|
| 2:20:52| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8452)|
| 2:20:56| Commissioner Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8456)|
| 2:20:57| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8457)|
| 2:20:59| Sheriff, would you give us the figures again for your actual uniformed officers on the street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8459)|
| 2:21:06| You don't have to be exact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8466)|
| 2:21:08| I think it was 453, and don't hold me to that exactly, but that's roughly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8468)|
| 2:21:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8473)|
| 2:21:14| And that's about 75 more than KPD?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8474)|
| 2:21:16| I think it's, you know, don't hold me to that either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8476)|
| 2:21:18| Brad could probably tell you exactly what that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8478)|
| 2:21:20| I don't know what their numbers are now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8480)|
| 2:21:22| Our authorized strength is 417, and we should hit that with the next recruit class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8482)|
| 2:21:26| KPD is 417?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8486)|
| 2:21:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8487)|
| 2:21:28| Okay, up from 400 or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8488)|
| 2:21:29| That's uniformed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8489)|
| 2:21:30| I mean we've got 100 others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8490)|
| 2:21:32| And you've given us these numbers before, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8492)|
| 2:21:34| Could you give us again the Knox County Sheriff's Department versus KPD vehicles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8494)|
| 2:21:41| The last time that we did that comparison,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8501)|
| 2:21:43| the Knoxville Police Department had approximately 10 more take-home vehicles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8503)|
| 2:21:48| than the Knox County Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8508)|
| 2:21:53| In total?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8513)|
| 2:21:54| In total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8514)|
| 2:21:56| Like IV with an unmarked car?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8516)|
| 2:21:58| Yes, that's in total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8518)|
| 2:22:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8520)|
| 2:22:01| Of course, now I can't tell you who besides officers have vehicles over there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8521)|
| 2:22:04| or how their vehicles are distributed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8524)|
| 2:22:06| Only that total number is all I can give you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8526)|
| 2:22:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8528)|
| 2:22:09| And if the budget were to pass as presented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8529)|
| 2:22:13| does the $500 trickle down to your people also, the bonus, the proposed bonus?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8533)|
| 2:22:19| The $500 proposed bonus would include the Knox County Sheriff's Office people, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8539)|
| 2:22:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8545)|
| 2:22:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8547)|
| 2:22:30| Any other questions for the Sheriff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8550)|
| 2:22:34| Thank you, Sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8554)|
| 2:22:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8555)|
| 2:22:38| Next is Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8558)|
| 2:22:40| We've got Dr. Jim McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8560)|
| 2:23:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8580)|
| 2:23:02| Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman, commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8582)|
| 2:23:05| With your permission, we'll start with an introduction from India Kincannon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8585)|
| 2:23:08| who is our school board chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8588)|
| 2:23:14| Thank you, Dr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8594)|
| 2:23:16| Mr. Chairman, commissioners, thanks again for the opportunity to appear before you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8596)|
| 2:23:21| and formally present our budget to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8601)|
| 2:23:24| I know that you've had an opportunity probably to review it already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8604)|
| 2:23:28| and we'll be happy to answer questions at the end of the presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8608)|
| 2:23:34| But I especially appreciate the time you've taken to see how our budget fits in with our educational mission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8614)|
| 2:23:40| I know that education is important to all of you and all your constituents, so I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8620)|
| 2:23:46| I also wanted to briefly thank Dr. McIntyre and his staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8626)|
| 2:23:49| I think it's been a really open and transparent budget process that started long ago back in July,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8629)|
| 2:23:56| and the public's had an opportunity to comment and the board's had ample opportunity to scrutinize it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8636)|
| 2:24:01| and I think the efforts have paid off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8641)|
| 2:24:04| The budget is coherent, transparent, strategic, and fiscally sound,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8644)|
| 2:24:10| all of which I think are very important to our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8650)|
| 2:24:14| I also wanted to thank Mayor Ragsdale and Finance Director John Troyer for working so often| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8654)|
| 2:24:21| and collaboratively with our budget staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8661)|
| 2:24:23| As you know, the school budget takes up about two-thirds of the overall county budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8663)|
| 2:24:28| so it's really important that we communicate on an ongoing basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8668)|
| 2:24:32| not just in the weeks right before an important vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8672)|
| 2:24:35| And I know that commissioners have been very willing to attend various meetings with school board and school people to do that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8675)|
| 2:24:43| So I did want to mention before I turn it over to Dr. McIntyre one thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8683)|
| 2:24:49| especially for those of you who have been through this before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8689)|
| 2:24:52| This budget is a little bit different from the years past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=8692)|
