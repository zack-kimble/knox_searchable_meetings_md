| 0:05:40| Hey, wait a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=340)|
| 0:05:48| Now I've lost my testimony piece here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=348)|
| 0:05:54| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=354)|
| 0:05:56| Here, you need to explain to your father the procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=356)|
| 0:05:59| And I'm going to explain them to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=359)|
| 0:06:01| and then we'll go through them again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=361)|
| 0:06:02| so you'll have them to think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=362)|
| 0:06:05| The procedures here today, we will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=365)|
| 0:06:09| bring forth someone from the Sheriff's Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=369)|
| 0:06:12| and they will present the charges to this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=372)|
| 0:06:16| After the officer is through testifying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=376)|
| 0:06:20| I will ask your father whether he affirms what has been said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=380)|
| 0:06:26| or whether he denies what has been said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=386)|
| 0:06:30| At that time, whatever he says, he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=390)|
| 0:06:32| will have an opportunity to give testimony on his behalf| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=392)|
| 0:06:37| before this board, OK?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=397)|
| 0:06:42| Then I will turn it over to this board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=402)|
| 0:06:45| and they will then ask relevant questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=405)|
| 0:06:49| and that he will have to answer honestly and affirm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=409)|
| 0:06:54| Then at that time, this board will make its ruling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=414)|
| 0:06:58| Based upon that ruling, I'll give you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=418)|
| 0:07:01| further directions at that time, OK?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=421)|
| 0:07:03| So here's what we're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=423)|
| 0:07:05| I want you to tell your father that an officer will come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=425)|
| 0:07:10| and testify as to what he believes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=430)|
| 0:07:13| the alleged violation has been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=433)|
| 0:07:36| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=456)|
| 0:07:38| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=458)|
| 0:07:39| After telling when the officer is through testifying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=459)|
| 0:07:43| then I will ask him the question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=463)|
| 0:07:47| and then whether he agrees or disagrees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=467)|
| 0:07:50| Does he know what affirm or deny means?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=470)|
| 0:07:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=472)|
| 0:07:52| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=472)|
| 0:07:53| Whether he understands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=473)|
| 0:07:55| So we're all on the same page right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=475)|
| 0:07:57| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=477)|
| 0:07:58| If you all will step to the side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=478)|
| 0:08:00| I will be calling Captain May to come and testify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=480)|
| 0:08:04| And then when we're through, Wolfie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=484)|
| 0:08:07| as you give your testimony, I need this person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=487)|

| 0:09:51| The officer is, it doesn't matter the number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=591)|

| 0:09:57| that he has sold beer to minors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=597)|
| 0:10:01| And I'm going to ask him, does he affirm or deny that charge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=601)|
| 0:10:06| And he needs to answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=606)|

| 0:10:14| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=614)|
| 0:10:16| At this time, I'm going to give him an opportunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=616)|
| 0:10:19| through you, to testify on his behalf anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=619)|

| 0:11:07| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=667)|
| 0:11:08| Is there anything you would like to testify to this body to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=668)|
| 0:11:13| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=673)|
| 0:11:20| This time, it's just busy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=680)|
| 0:11:24| I go outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=684)|
| 0:11:25| That one, the service, see the new beers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=685)|
| 0:11:28| He don't know about this, the beer about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=688)|
| 0:11:31| This is show me a ticket beers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=691)|
| 0:11:33| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=693)|
| 0:11:34| I'm not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=694)|
| 0:11:35| And I got back, it happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=695)|
| 0:11:38| So what you just said is you went outside, it was busy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=698)|
| 0:11:41| you went outside, and somebody else sold him the beer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=701)|
| 0:11:43| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=703)|
| 0:11:46| Is that true, Wolfie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=706)|
| 0:11:49| Not sure he's talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=709)|
| 0:11:51| I think he's telling the time he missed the beer board last month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=711)|
| 0:11:56| that when I went out and talked to him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=716)|
| 0:11:59| he said that he was too busy to come in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=719)|
| 0:12:03| I didn't have anyone to run the restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=723)|
| 0:12:06| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=726)|
| 0:12:11| I'm going to ask your son.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=731)|
| 0:12:12| Do you have any statements or anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=732)|
| 0:12:15| that you would like to add to his case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=735)|
| 0:12:17| So which case are we talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=737)|
| 0:12:19| We're not talking about missing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=739)|
| 0:12:20| We don't care that you missed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=740)|
| 0:12:21| We're talking about selling the beer to the underage consumer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=741)|
| 0:12:26| I see what he say was confirmed, that the restaurant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=746)|
| 0:12:29| did sell it to the minors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=749)|
| 0:12:31| But he wasn't present when the beer was sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=751)|
| 0:12:35| And because of that, on that day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=755)|
| 0:12:36| he was busy working in the kitchen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=756)|
| 0:12:38| And he wasn't the person that sold it to the minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=758)|
| 0:12:42| And he would like to add, because he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=762)|
| 0:12:44| told me about the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=764)|
| 0:12:46| On that day, there was three people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=766)|
| 0:12:56| One of them looks like, I mean, from the look of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=776)|
| 0:13:00| it looks much older than my dad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=780)|
| 0:13:02| And the other two, it's pretty much like this age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=782)|
| 0:13:06| So the restaurant employee told us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=786)|
| 0:13:11| that she missed it, because I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=791)|
| 0:13:15| know what was the really case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=795)|
| 0:13:19| So maybe because she did not know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=799)|
| 0:13:23| because she might have thought they all overage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=803)|
| 0:13:28| because they don't look a slim sight, like underage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=808)|
| 0:13:35| Did she check the ID?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=815)|
| 0:13:37| She did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=817)|
| 0:13:38| She missed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=818)|
| 0:13:40| So she normally does that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=820)|
| 0:13:41| But on that day, I don't know what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=821)|
| 0:13:45| Because we normally have a policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=825)|
| 0:13:47| we have to check the ID always.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=827)|
| 0:13:48| And are your servers trained and carry their server card?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=828)|
| 0:13:52| She was new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=832)|
| 0:13:54| She was new just getting to the restaurant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=834)|
| 0:13:55| because we have the new server changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=835)|
| 0:13:58| Because the turnover is kind of great for the restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=838)|
| 0:14:01| Commissioner Olinby?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=841)|
| 0:14:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=843)|
| 0:14:07| Is she still employed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=847)|
| 0:14:09| She is currently, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=849)|
| 0:14:11| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=851)|
| 0:14:12| We have talked to her, and see what's her case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=852)|
| 0:14:16| She say she did not, like she was missed on that day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=856)|
| 0:14:21| because she cannot remember that clearly what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=861)|
| 0:14:25| was happened that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=865)|
| 0:14:27| But she did not do that on purpose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=867)|
| 0:14:29| selling the beer to underage personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=869)|
| 0:14:33| She was fully aware that selling to underage personnel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=873)|
| 0:14:37| would be against the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=877)|
| 0:14:41| The state law is, you card everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=881)|
| 0:14:45| You don't, no matter how old they look or anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=885)|
| 0:14:47| I mean, they're 95 years old, they still get card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=887)|
| 0:14:51| I mean, that's going to save her or anybody in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=891)|
| 0:14:55| So that needs to be stressed to every single one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=895)|
| 0:14:59| Card every single person that comes in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=899)|
| 0:15:01| That might come to you on, oh, like, because we did not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=901)|
| 0:15:05| she was new, so we did not have a fully trained for her, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=905)|
| 0:15:11| Sir, do you agree with what your son has said so far?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=911)|
| 0:15:14| We don't want to call him that, that's what I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=914)|
| 0:15:19| Do you understand what your son, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=919)|
| 0:15:20| understand what's being said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=920)|

| 0:15:28| He's going to say most of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=928)|
| 0:15:29| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=929)|
| 0:15:30| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=930)|
| 0:15:34| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=934)|

| 0:15:53| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=953)|
| 0:15:54| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=954)|

| 0:16:07| I was the one that served the beer before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=967)|
| 0:16:09| but I do not work on the weekdays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=969)|

| 0:16:14| And I have the license for that, to serve beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=974)|

| 0:16:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=988)|
| 0:16:29| Why did this employee wait two months to start on hers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=989)|
| 0:16:35| She did not, like, she wasn't aware that, like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=995)|
| 0:16:40| before the incident, she did not, like, she was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=1000)|
| 0:16:45| she wasn't supposed to serve beer on that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=1005)|
| 0:16:48| But it was, you know, certain circumstances, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=1008)|
| 0:16:53| Because there wasn't anyone there to present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=1013)|

| 0:17:20| But she had to go to traveling, go to, like, Pennsylvania,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=1040)|
| 0:17:25| where her family was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=1045)|
| 0:17:28| Well, does your dad understand that it's, if he's the owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=1048)|
| 0:17:32| it's his responsibility to see that all his employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=1052)|
| 0:17:38| have their server permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=1058)|
| 0:17:50| He say that, like, almost all of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=1070)|
| 0:17:54| beer had been sold by him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=1074)|
| 0:17:56| And there wasn't any employees that was sold before that case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=1076)|
| 0:18:00| And they were one, like, we were planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=1080)|
| 0:18:03| on getting her to get the license so she can take over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=1083)|
| 0:18:08| But, like, just, it just happened before she got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=1088)|
| 0:18:13| a chance to get her license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=1093)|
| 0:18:16| Before we make a determination here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=1096)|
| 0:18:18| is, does your dad plan to continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=1098)|
| 0:18:23| to sell beer at his restaurant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=1103)|
| 0:18:30| Because he had indicated to Captain May| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=1110)|
| 0:18:34| that he may want to give it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=1114)|
| 0:18:46| He would like to continue to serve beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=1126)|
| 0:18:50| He would like to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=1130)|
| 0:18:51| He would like to continue if he got a chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=1131)|
| 0:18:55| Because he expressed that to you, right, Wolfie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=1135)|
| 0:18:58| That he might give it up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=1138)|
| 0:19:01| Thinking about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=1141)|
| 0:19:04| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=1144)|
| 0:19:05| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=1145)|

| 0:19:15| but I'm not hearing any urgency on fixing the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=1155)|
| 0:19:19| And I really don't know if there's other servers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=1159)|
| 0:19:21| or other people that can do the beer while this person's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=1161)|
| 0:19:23| even been through their training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=1163)|
| 0:19:25| was even selling the beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=1165)|
| 0:19:26| So that really disturbs me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=1166)|
| 0:19:28| I mean, what are you going to do to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=1168)|
| 0:19:31| this never happens again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=1171)|
| 0:19:35| We'll have, like, the servers that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=1175)|
| 0:19:37| are being trained before they can actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=1177)|
| 0:19:39| start to do their service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=1179)|
| 0:19:42| Like, doing waiting tables.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=1182)|
| 0:19:44| They have, everybody have to get their license before they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=1184)|
| 0:19:48| start working at the restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=1188)|
| 0:19:50| Well, after this happened, did you get everybody together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=1190)|
| 0:19:53| and stress how important this is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=1193)|
| 0:19:56| We did, like, have, like, aware of how important this case is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=1196)|
| 0:20:02| And that's why we, like, would like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=1202)|
| 0:20:05| to continue to get that beer's license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=1205)|
| 0:20:08| And we'll have everything straightened out afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=1208)|
| 0:20:12| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=1212)|

| 0:26:56| property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=1616)|
| 0:26:58| But it's grandfathered in, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=1618)|
| 0:27:00| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=1620)|
| 0:27:01| And Tate's owns both buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=1621)|

| 0:27:09| Can you put your mic down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=1629)|
| 0:27:11| We had a occasion last beer board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=1631)|
| 0:27:14| that the gondolier had served, and they didn't actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=1634)|
| 0:27:19| have a beer license because they changed owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=1639)|
| 0:27:22| and hadn't changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=1642)|
| 0:27:23| So this is kind of a continuation from last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=1643)|
| 0:27:28| Did we find them last month or anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=1648)|
| 0:27:30| Or did we determine they didn't have a beer license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=1650)|
| 0:27:32| Or how did we do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=1652)|
| 0:27:34| What did we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=1654)|
| 0:27:35| What was our resolution last month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=1655)|
| 0:27:37| You know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=1657)|
| 0:27:42| I paid $1,000 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=1662)|
| 0:27:43| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=1663)|
| 0:27:44| I posted so many times out there for the underage beer sale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=1664)|
| 0:27:49| and then the change of ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=1669)|
| 0:27:51| So I couldn't remember how many times I've been out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=1671)|
| 0:27:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=1674)|
| 0:27:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=1674)|
| 0:27:55| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=1675)|
| 0:27:58| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=1678)|
| 0:28:00| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=1680)|
| 0:28:01| Now, I think it's fair to say that this ownership change was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=1681)|
| 0:28:05| not due to the last sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=1685)|
| 0:28:08| This was going on prior to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=1688)|
| 0:28:10| It's fair to be fair to this gentleman here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=1690)|
| 0:28:12| This was under another ownership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=1692)|
| 0:28:15| but he came and appeared because he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=1695)|
| 0:28:17| held ownership of the business in the middle of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=1697)|
| 0:28:20| So I think it's fair to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=1700)|
| 0:28:23| So what do we got?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=1703)|
| 0:28:25| I didn't hear the first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=1705)|
| 0:28:26| Pendings, with all the pendings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=1706)|
| 0:28:28| Mr. McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=1708)|
| 0:28:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=1710)|
| 0:28:30| And while I definitely understand and agree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=1710)|
| 0:28:33| I'll say, you know, habits are fairly easy to kind of either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=1713)|
| 0:28:40| sink into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=1720)|
| 0:28:40| So I'm assuming that our youth have the habit of potentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=1720)|
| 0:28:46| buying underage alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=1726)|
| 0:28:47| So like you say, you're starting off in the hole, $1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=1727)|
| 0:28:51| But hopefully, we won't see you here anymore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=1731)|
| 0:28:55| and that this place will not have any further underage sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=1735)|
| 0:29:00| So good luck to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=1740)|
| 0:29:02| Thanks, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=1742)|
| 0:29:06| We have a motion to approve pending the health department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=1746)|

| 0:29:34| from coming back up here like you had to come last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=1774)|

| 0:36:37| There are actually six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2197)|
| 0:36:40| There are a few points of those two I'll finish now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2200)|
| 0:36:43| In addition to 23 court tapes being deleted and being framed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2203)|
| 0:36:49| and falsely arrested outside the attorney general's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2209)|
| 0:36:52| for reporting those 23 tapes, 11 subpoenaed witnesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2212)|
| 0:36:58| all who could have faced contempt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2218)|
| 0:37:00| didn't show for court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2220)|
| 0:37:02| That's for no mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2222)|
| 0:37:03| This was programmed and planned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2223)|
| 0:37:06| The two ambushes, including the one outside the AG's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2226)|
| 0:37:12| if I were guilty, I would have not wanted the video feed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2232)|
| 0:37:15| But instead, I requested it from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2235)|
| 0:37:19| Not the sheriff's bullies, cowards, and paid liars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2239)|
| 0:37:23| and state-sponsored terrorists that did this to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2243)|
| 0:37:27| And that video feed was deleted, you guessed it, as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2247)|
| 0:37:33| Roger Goodell, commissioner of the NFL,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2253)|
| 0:37:35| stated in the midst of the Ray Rice event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2255)|
| 0:37:39| one of the marks of true leadership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2259)|
| 0:37:42| is taking responsibility when things go wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2262)|
| 0:37:46| 11 of the Pharisees is hypocrisy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2266)|
| 0:37:50| And when Jesus Christ was talking about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2270)|
| 0:37:54| what he essentially said is that your hypocrisy invalidates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2274)|
| 0:37:59| your authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2279)|
| 0:38:02| The taking of one's liberty is equal to taking of one's life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2282)|
| 0:38:07| because without liberty, there can be no life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2287)|
| 0:38:12| The great Thomas Jefferson said that the spirit of resistance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2292)|
| 0:38:16| to government is so valuable on certain occasions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2296)|
| 0:38:20| that I wish it to always be capitalized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2300)|
| 0:38:23| And this is one of those occasions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2303)|
| 0:38:28| Commonly, we will see the right of the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2308)|
| 0:38:31| to peacefully assemble to redress government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2311)|
| 0:38:33| for grievances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2313)|
| 0:38:35| Although there are others, such as the rights duty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2315)|
| 0:38:38| clause in the Constitution, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2318)|
| 0:38:41| falls in the Constitution that exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2321)|
| 0:38:45| It states, for light and trivial matters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2325)|
| 0:38:47| the people shall not descend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2327)|
| 0:38:49| But when a long train of abuse and usurpation arises,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2329)|
| 0:38:54| it's not only the right, but it is the duty of the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2334)|
| 0:38:58| to establish new guards, altering, separating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2338)|
| 0:39:02| and abolishing tyranny until its end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2342)|
| 0:39:06| This Knox County, Knoxville State of Tennessee government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2346)|
| 0:39:09| in this region is a tyranny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2349)|
| 0:39:12| And I hereby, officially and publicly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2352)|
| 0:39:15| am altering and separating you until next week, next Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2355)|
| 0:39:21| beginning at tomorrow, the 28th, Tuesday at 8 AM.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2361)|
| 0:39:27| The government will be closed and cease to operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2367)|
| 0:39:30| The Sheriff's Department will be allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2370)|
| 0:39:32| to open to maintain order, the Fire Department, and the KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2372)|
| 0:39:37| This building will not be open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2377)|
| 0:39:39| You have been notified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2379)|
| 0:39:44| Power corrupts and power absolutely corrupts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2384)|
| 0:39:49| But I learned a thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2389)|
| 0:39:51| Power concedes to nothing unless there is a demand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2391)|
| 0:39:56| At that point, the rights of the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2396)|
| 0:39:59| cry out, freedom at last, no matter what the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2399)|
| 0:40:03| Like Martin Luther and Rosa Parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2403)|
| 0:40:07| we have reached a crossroads, a strategic inflection point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2407)|
| 0:40:12| where compromise and negotiations can no longer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2412)|
| 0:40:15| be tolerated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2415)|
| 0:40:17| It is time for a revolutionary movement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2417)|
| 0:40:21| And that has started today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2421)|
| 0:40:23| The judgment has been set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2423)|
| 0:40:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2429)|
| 0:40:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2429)|
| 0:40:30| I'll take any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2430)|
| 0:40:32| There are none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2432)|
| 0:40:33| Thank you, Mr. Clough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2433)|
| 0:40:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2437)|
| 0:41:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2462)|
| 0:41:02| We'll go ahead and move forward with our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2462)|
| 0:41:06| Resolution 102, Mr. Rawls is asked to be moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2466)|
| 0:41:10| And 103, Mr. McKenzie is asked to be moved until next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2470)|
| 0:41:16| Could I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2476)|
| 0:41:16| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2476)|
| 0:41:19| Could I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2479)|
| 0:41:19| I also wanted to add a discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2479)|
| 0:41:22| OK, let me get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2482)|
| 0:41:23| I'm just doing the resolutions right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2483)|
| 0:41:24| And then I think the other honorary resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2484)|
| 0:41:26| for commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2486)|
| 0:41:27| 101 will move until next month, and the family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2487)|
| 0:41:30| will be here next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2490)|
| 0:41:31| So all three will be 103.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2491)|
| 0:41:33| All three will be next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2493)|
| 0:41:36| Next commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2496)|
| 0:41:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2501)|
| 0:41:41| Today, in normal practice today, Commissioner Brantley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2501)|
| 0:41:48| would have the devotion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2508)|
| 0:41:49| He still will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2509)|
| 0:41:49| But I have asked, this last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2509)|
| 0:41:52| the Sheriff's Department suffered a significant loss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2512)|
| 0:41:54| of a retired captain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2514)|
| 0:41:56| And so Mr. Thomas was good, close friends with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2516)|
| 0:41:59| And I'll ask you to say a word, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2519)|
| 0:42:00| Yeah, you know Captain Fred Ludwig.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2520)|
| 0:42:04| I've known him 37 years or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2524)|
| 0:42:06| He was with the Sheriff's Department 37 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2526)|
| 0:42:09| He just recently retired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2529)|
| 0:42:11| But then the last few months, he'd not been feeling well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2531)|
| 0:42:15| And he ended up going on to heaven last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2535)|
| 0:42:21| His receiving of prayers will be tonight, 5 to 7,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2541)|
| 0:42:25| at the Shepherd of the Hills Church on Beaver Creek Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2545)|
| 0:42:29| And at 10 o'clock tomorrow morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2549)|
| 0:42:30| we'll be gathering at the Expo Center for all the vehicles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2550)|
| 0:42:36| that want to go in the procession| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2556)|
| 0:42:37| to go out to the Veterans Cemetery on John Spira Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2557)|
| 0:42:40| with a service there at 1130.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2560)|
| 0:42:43| And just to be sure we remember him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2563)|
| 0:42:47| 37 years with the Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2567)|
| 0:42:50| He's a great representative of our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2570)|
| 0:42:52| and very, very, very well-liked all the way around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2572)|
| 0:42:55| Commissioner Brantley, the devotion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2575)|
| 0:42:57| Would you bow your heads, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2577)|
| 0:42:59| Dear Heavenly Father, thank you for this day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2579)|
| 0:43:02| Thank you for this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2582)|
| 0:43:03| During this meeting, may we do your will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2583)|
| 0:43:06| and help the people of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2586)|
| 0:43:08| And Father, we ask you also to continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2588)|
| 0:43:10| to help the people of Hamilton County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2590)|
| 0:43:13| to overcome their grief from that recent tragedy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2593)|
| 0:43:16| We pray this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2596)|
| 0:43:17| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2597)|
| 0:43:18| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2598)|
| 0:43:21| Commissioner McKenzie, would you loosen the pledge, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2601)|
| 0:43:24| May we all stand, face the flag?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2604)|
| 0:43:30| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2610)|
| 0:43:35| and to the republic for which it stands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2615)|
| 0:43:38| one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2618)|
| 0:43:42| and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2622)|
| 0:43:51| Is there a motion for the approval of the minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2631)|

| 0:44:05| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2645)|
| 0:44:06| I'd like to add a discussion item on recent events| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=2646)|

| 1:01:42| On page 21, spread of record of the Knox County Mayor's Order reappointing Greg Lue to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=3702)|
| 1:01:43| Board of Commissioners for the Knox Chapman utility district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=3703)|
| 1:01:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=3704)|
| 1:01:45| And Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=3705)|
| 1:01:46| I guess that's the only discussion I want to have, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=3706)|
| 1:01:47| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=3707)|
| 1:01:48| Thank you, Mr. Chair. We've had a series of extremely unfortunate and tragic events that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=3708)|
| 1:02:01| have happened in this country over the past really few weeks. I want to extend it to months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=3721)|
| 1:02:10| And those things really, really pull at our heartstrings, some more than others. And that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=3730)|
| 1:02:17| a natural thing. You know, some things get you, some things you'll read an article about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=3737)|
| 1:02:22| and it's okay, and some you'll read and it really affects you at a deep spot. So I understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=3742)|
| 1:02:29| that. The shooting in Charleston affected me that way. You know, when you look at Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=3749)|
| 1:02:36| Ruff, he looks like any other Joe public type of figure, but to have that much hate and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=3756)|
| 1:02:48| callousness in his heart, it just still boggles my mind. Similarly with the Chattanooga shooting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=3768)|
| 1:02:58| And it was, it's truly tragic to see this gentleman born and raised, seems like in Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=3778)|
| 1:03:06| and just to have something tragic like that happens, it's just, it's unbelievable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=3786)|
| 1:03:14| But as a public figure, you know, we had a big controversy about the flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=3794)|
| 1:03:21| As a public figure, I need to understand that what I'm saying, what I'm doing is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=3801)|
| 1:03:29| heard, it's understood, and it needs to be tempered. What am I saying? Foster Arnett| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=3809)|
| 1:03:39| has really disrespected his position, his county, by issuing those hate-filled statements that he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=3819)|
| 1:03:48| did. There's no privacy in terms of Facebook. He understood what he was doing, and to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=3828)|
| 1:03:59| outlandish statements like that, referring to anyone, we're a melting pot. We are a melting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=3839)|
| 1:04:06| pot, like it or not. This United States of America is a melting pot. That's what we were founded on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=3846)|
| 1:04:11| that's what makes us great, in my opinion. But for him to attack in the way that he attacked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=3851)|
| 1:04:23| and then issue a non-apology apology by saying, I'm sorry, I don't approve the path the United| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=3863)|
| 1:04:31| States is going down, nor the president, that's not an apology. That's the furthering of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=3871)|
| 1:04:39| I was right, and this gentleman has just, you know, we should be embarrassed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=3879)|
| 1:04:47| I don't care whether it gets to be a national story or not, we should be embarrassed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=3887)|
| 1:04:52| by our county-wide elected official. He's got work to do. When you go and look at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=3892)|
| 1:05:03| the Hotel Motel audit, he's got work to do. He doesn't need to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=3903)|
| 1:05:10| fooling with the things that he's fooling with. If you look at what the executive summary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=3910)|
| 1:05:18| what they found was, we've lost, or stand to lose, over $475,000, almost $476,000. Of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=3918)|
| 1:05:33| $221,000 is being verified. And he's posting. He has work to do, but he's choosing not to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=3933)|
| 1:05:42| what we've elected and are paying a hearty salary for him to do. That's his responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=3942)|
| 1:05:53| And he talked about, he welcomed an ethics evaluation. When you look at our,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=3953)|
| 1:06:01| what the State Ethics Commission has said in their guiding principles for ethical behavior of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=3961)|
| 1:06:07| public officials, it says the public officials should not, by his or her statements or conduct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=3967)|
| 1:06:14| give reasonable basis for the impression that any person can properly influence him or her,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=3974)|
| 1:06:21| receive favoritism in the performance of his or her official role, or that the official's decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=3981)|
| 1:06:28| are affected by kinship, rank, or position. When I issue a statement, when something appears in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=3988)|
| 1:06:35| the news, Sentinel, Focus, or whatever, the Mercury, it's County Commissioner, as it is for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=3995)|
| 1:06:44| all of us. So, I think, I strongly feel that we need to dig into this. I think, I feel strongly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=4004)|
| 1:07:02| that I don't feel that he can do his job. Personally, I don't think he can do his job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=4022)|
| 1:07:07| He said, he's made a statement that says, my beliefs will never impede the workings of my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=4027)|
| 1:07:14| office or the professional job that I've been, that I'm expected to carry out until 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=4034)|
| 1:07:23| I disagree. And I don't know, I'm going to ask the law department to either evaluate or tell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=4043)|
| 1:07:30| me which department I need to go to, but I believe, since he's taken office, the minority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=4050)|
| 1:07:40| hiring, especially in management positions, have gone to nothing. I think he's turned that office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=4060)|
| 1:07:46| over, in terms of minority hiring, to where there aren't any in management. So, I would ask for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=4066)|
| 1:07:52| research to be done, if I could get that by next month. I think it does have an effect on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=4072)|
| 1:07:58| When you issue hate-filled statements like this about any one person, it's not isolated to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=4078)|
| 1:08:04| one particular one. He doesn't like the fact that we're a melting pot, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=4084)|
| 1:08:09| based on what I've read and what I continue to read in his non-apology apologies. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=4089)|
| 1:08:16| this is very disturbing to me. It should be very disturbing to anyone, whether you can agree with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=4096)|
| 1:08:24| him. But to make statements like that, when you have a county-wide office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=4104)|
| 1:08:35| it's just inexcusable and unforgivable. So, again, I'll ask those questions. I'll follow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=4115)|
| 1:08:44| up with you. But, again, I don't know if your department or one of the mayor's other departments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=4124)|
| 1:08:48| I know there's a department for that with the county, but I don't know about the fee offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=4128)|
| 1:08:55| I'm going to ask for that information to be submitted to all of us, and it would be great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=4135)|
| 1:09:03| if it was sent to all commissioners once that research is done. It shouldn't take a whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=4143)|
| 1:09:07| whole lot. I don't think there are a huge number of employees. So, again, as I ask you just to kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=4147)|
| 1:09:17| of search your heart on this. Look at what the man said. Look at what his apology says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=4157)|
| 1:09:24| I'm the first district's commissioner, and I'll close with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=4164)|
| 1:09:29| There's Democrats. There's Republicans in the first district. I represent the first district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=4169)|
| 1:09:36| and I do that to the best of my abilities, to represent all people in the first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=4176)|
| 1:09:42| I didn't like a lot of the policies of some of our previous presidents, but you don't see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=4182)|
| 1:09:50| elected officials making these statements like this. I mean, you can disagree, but to tie in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=4190)|
| 1:09:57| these statements with, you know, this, again, it's hate. It's just hate. It's a shame. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=4197)|
| 1:10:07| again, I'll ask for those things, but I'm very, very disappointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=4207)|
| 1:10:13| I just paid my taxes and my tax, my specialty tax, and my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=4213)|
| 1:10:25| the other, I forgot the $25 tax, will tax for my truck. They're at the office. Some great people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=4225)|
| 1:10:33| work there. Extremely professional people, but it all falls to leadership, and I think we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=4233)|
| 1:10:41| a problem at the leadership position. Thank you. Is there any other items? Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=4241)|
| 1:10:50| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This comes under the heading of an announcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=4250)|
| 1:10:54| The county's gone through a process of bidding process to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=4254)|
| 1:11:02| select a new external auditor. That information will be before full commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=4262)|
| 1:11:08| next month. I believe that the purchasing department is in the process of getting a contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=4268)|
| 1:11:15| written to their negotiation with Pew and Company to finalize the contract. There were six| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=4275)|
| 1:11:24| firms that bid for this contract, and as a member of the Audit Committee, I have a copy of all six| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=4284)|
| 1:11:31| of those proposals. If anyone on commission would like to see those proposals, this is the last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=4291)|
| 1:11:38| time I'm carrying them in here. You'll have to look at them online after the viewing period here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=4298)|
| 1:11:44| this afternoon. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. All right. Real quick, next month, I think the special| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=4304)|
| 1:11:52| election for District 14 is after, I think, if the certification is done on the next election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=4312)|
| 1:11:58| obviously the winner of that will be the presumed candidate or presumed elected official. So, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=4318)|
| 1:12:04| will have an appointment next month of that person if the election is certified, only if the election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=4324)|
| 1:12:11| is certified. I think that's wise to go ahead and get them into the office down there. Any other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=4331)|
| 1:12:18| announcements before the body? If not, we are adjourned. Thank you. Seven o'clock. All right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=4338)|
| 1:12:23| commissioners, if you will take your seats there. It's right at seven o'clock. We're going ahead and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=4343)|

| 1:15:59| Homeowners Association and several other homeowners associations in the area. And we're asking that if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=4559)|
| 1:16:06| this body is going to postpone, that they postpone until January to allow people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=4566)|
| 1:16:11| that have an interest to make sure they're here. That's our request. What's the difference in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=4571)|
| 1:16:18| November and January? Holidays, for the most part, and getting people here. It'll be the week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=4578)|
| 1:16:24| prior to, we move them back a week, it's not in the Thanksgiving week, it's the week before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=4584)|
| 1:16:29| Thanksgiving. Right. I have a personal reason, but I'm not going to publicize it. I can't be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=4589)|
| 1:16:37| here for that meeting, but I'm asking the Commission to consider moving it until January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=4597)|
| 1:16:43| I'd like a substitute motion that we move it to January. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=4603)|
| 1:16:55| Did you want to weigh in on this, Mr. Huber?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=4615)|
| 1:17:00| Because did you originally say you wanted four to six months to figure things out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=4620)|
| 1:17:04| Well, first off, with John Huber, 213 Fox Road, first off, it's truthfully not even me requesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=4624)|
| 1:17:14| the postponement. It's the sellers of the property. You know, we went down the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=4634)|
| 1:17:18| I contracted the property, we started looking at it, and there's been a question about the access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=4638)|
| 1:17:24| with First Utility District. So we're trying to figure that out now. I've personally formally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=4644)|
| 1:17:31| withdrawn my application, if you will, or my request of First Utility District to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=4651)|
| 1:17:37| the proposed entrance that I had proposed, but the sellers are still wanting to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=4657)|
| 1:17:47| So they've asked me to, since this application is already in the process, that they don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=4667)|
| 1:17:51| necessarily want to stop. So they've thrown out 120 days. You know, it might even be better to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=4671)|
| 1:17:59| it in 90. I mean, I'm just throwing things out, but you know, we could go December, maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=4679)|
| 1:18:11| Mr. Kline, would 90 days work better for your schedule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=4691)|
| 1:18:15| since you're representing the folks in the room?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=4695)|
| 1:18:20| 90 days would put it to the September, October, excuse me, October 2015 meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=4700)|
| 1:18:30| We can do it in October. I just prefer not to do it in November or December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=4710)|
| 1:18:35| The 90 days, is that okay with you? All right, I'll amend my original motion to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=4715)|
| 1:18:41| the October meeting in the second degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=4721)|

| 1:18:46| Yeah, I think you will have to. There's a substitute motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=4726)|
| 1:18:50| What?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=4730)|
| 1:18:50| I'll withdraw my substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=4730)|
| 1:18:54| All right, so we're in October. Motion to delay until October. Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150727?start=4734)|
