| 0:02:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=140)|
| 0:02:21| For the Mayor's report, first I want to mention a few upcoming events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=141)|
| 0:02:25| Recognize a Deputy Director who just won a prestigious award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=145)|
| 0:02:30| And then demonstrate or talk about a new phone app that will serve those who ride the CAT buses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=150)|
| 0:02:37| First off, a reminder that the Covenant Health Knoxville Marathon, which includes the marathon and five other races, are being run this weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=157)|
| 0:02:47| We just had the kickoff press conference a little earlier this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=167)|
| 0:02:51| There's a lot of excitement around already, and there will be road closures, as you might expect, to accommodate the races.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=171)|
| 0:02:58| The marathon, half marathon, and relay races start at 7.30 a.m. Sunday, this coming Sunday, March 31st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=178)|
| 0:03:06| And that's when most of the road closures will take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=186)|
| 0:03:09| There's also some races on Saturday as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=189)|
| 0:03:13| But you visit the city's website, knoxvilletn.gov slash news, or the race website, which is knoxvillemarathon.com, to get all the details on the traffic plans and the temporary road closures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=193)|
| 0:03:26| This race draws more than 8,000 runners from across Tennessee and 44 other states.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=206)|
| 0:03:32| And the Knoxville Marathon is actually East Tennessee's largest competitive race, and it's a qualifier for the Boston Marathon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=212)|
| 0:03:40| Any council members running in it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=220)|
| 0:03:43| Relay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=223)|
| 0:03:44| The relay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=224)|
| 0:03:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=225)|
| 0:03:46| I'm going to do the 5K.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=226)|
| 0:03:47| The 5K?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=227)|
| 0:03:48| Really?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=228)|
| 0:03:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=229)|
| 0:03:50| Very impressive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=230)|
| 0:03:51| Well, don't embarrass us, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=231)|
| 0:03:52| I mean, do a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=232)|
| 0:03:55| Don't hold your breath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=235)|
| 0:03:57| Your son will probably beat me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=237)|
| 0:03:59| Your son will beat you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=239)|
| 0:04:00| No, really, that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=240)|
| 0:04:01| Congratulations on participating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=241)|
| 0:04:04| So there are 29 bands that are staged along the course of the marathon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=244)|
| 0:04:10| They play music throughout the race.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=250)|
| 0:04:13| Hundreds of residents turn out to cheer on the runners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=253)|
| 0:04:18| And, in fact, there's a competition among the neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=258)|
| 0:04:21| And I guess at the end of the day, the racers will say which neighborhood did they feel the most welcome in or which neighborhood was the best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=261)|
| 0:04:28| And then that neighborhood wins some kind of an award and recognition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=268)|
| 0:04:32| So that's coming this weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=272)|
| 0:04:35| So look for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=275)|
| 0:04:36| Look for a lot of people in running shorts, I guess, or running clothes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=276)|
| 0:04:41| With the calendar soon turning to April, it means it is Dogwood Arts Time in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=281)|
| 0:04:47| And after such a gray wet winter, I'm sure you're all looking forward to the dogwoods and the azaleas and the forsythias and the redbuds as they bloom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=287)|
| 0:04:55| So we have city crews that take a lot of pride in Knoxville during Dogwood Arts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=295)|
| 0:04:59| They do a lot of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=299)|
| 0:05:00| They put in really hundreds of hours to prepare along with our special events team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=300)|
| 0:05:06| A lot of the different departments get involved in this to try and get us ready for the largest springtime festival in our region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=306)|
| 0:05:14| So visit dogwoodarts.com for information on events, gardens, and driving tours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=314)|
| 0:05:20| And the ribbon cutting to start it off is at the Farragut Trail on Thursday, April 4th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=320)|
| 0:05:26| So I'll be there cutting the ribbon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=326)|
| 0:05:27| You guys join us if you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=327)|
| 0:05:29| That's Thursday, April 4th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=329)|
| 0:05:32| It doesn't have a time, but I think it's around noon or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=332)|
| 0:05:37| But if you want to be there, call me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=337)|
| 0:05:39| I'll let you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=339)|
| 0:05:40| Or call 311.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=340)|
| 0:05:42| Okay, so now I want to recognize Boyce Evans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=342)|
| 0:05:46| Where is Boyce?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=346)|
| 0:05:49| Come on up here, Boyce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=349)|
| 0:05:51| Boyce is our deputy finance director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=351)|
| 0:05:55| He recently was named by the East Tennessee Purchasing Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=355)|
| 0:06:01| He was named its manager of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=361)|
| 0:06:05| So y'all know probably that Boyce has served the city of Knoxville as its purchasing agent for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=365)|
| 0:06:16| How many years is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=376)|
| 0:06:18| About 12, 12 and a half years with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=378)|
| 0:06:22| For being promoted to his current role, he is now deputy director of finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=382)|
| 0:06:28| So he's right in the middle of all the budget along with Jim, the budget preparation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=388)|
| 0:06:32| But he was nominated for the award by his coworkers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=392)|
| 0:06:36| And here's how ETPA started off its announcement of Boyce's award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=396)|
| 0:06:42| Quote, he has progressively accepted the call of meeting his employer's needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=402)|
| 0:06:47| He has improved the overall climate of his organization through sound procurement principles, integrity, and teamwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=407)|
| 0:06:55| When asked by outsiders about his success, he selflessly points to his team, and they in turn point to his leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=415)|
| 0:07:03| That's really nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=423)|
| 0:07:06| That's a really nice thing that was said about you, Boyce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=426)|
| 0:07:09| So congratulations on your very well-deserved award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=429)|
| 0:07:11| We appreciate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=431)|
| 0:07:18| Now, where are the cat folks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=438)|
| 0:07:19| Melissa, you want to come on down as I'm talking about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=439)|
| 0:07:22| So we're really pleased to announce that we are officially launching the new real-time bus app.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=442)|
| 0:07:31| It is you go to your app store if you have an Apple or an iPhone or an Android, and you can download the cat app.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=451)|
| 0:07:42| You go to Cat Bus Tracker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=462)|
| 0:07:45| Okay, Cat Bus Tracker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=465)|
| 0:07:47| I see everybody pulling out their phones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=467)|
| 0:07:49| And then you can, if you want to figure out how to get home tonight, you can hit Trip Planner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=469)|
| 0:07:55| I'm not going to go through the whole thing, Melissa, because it would take me too long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=475)|
| 0:07:59| But you can actually find your route, and then you can find out when the bus is going to arrive and when it will leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=479)|
| 0:08:07| Do you want to talk a little more about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=487)|
| 0:08:09| And then you're also going to tell us some other things before we move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=489)|
| 0:08:14| Yes, thank you, Mayor, members of Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=494)|
| 0:08:16| Melissa Robertson with Knoxville Area Transit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=496)|
| 0:08:19| We are thrilled after a very, very long time and lots of effort and teamwork| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=499)|
| 0:08:27| and some great beta testers in Councilmember Ryder and Stair and Dr. Lyons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=507)|
| 0:08:33| who helped us test it before we decided that it was ready for public consumption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=513)|
| 0:08:39| But we're really excited about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=519)|
| 0:08:42| And if you go to the App Store, it is there and available for download.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=522)|
| 0:08:48| You can see your Cat Bus coming along the route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=528)|
| 0:08:53| So that's lots of fun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=533)|
| 0:08:55| You can just sit there and watch the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=535)|
| 0:08:57| The app is actually part two of a passenger technology rollout for Cat this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=537)|
| 0:09:04| with the first being a real-time texting feature, which was released in January of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=544)|
| 0:09:10| And I just want to note that the texting feature does not require a smartphone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=550)|
| 0:09:15| to access real-time arrival information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=555)|
| 0:09:18| So that expands the access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=558)|
| 0:09:21| As far as the texting feature, each bus stop in the Cat system, which there's over 1,200,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=561)|
| 0:09:27| has a unique stop ID number, and you text that stop number while you're standing at the stop to 22827,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=567)|
| 0:09:36| which provides immediate next bus times back to you by text.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=576)|
| 0:09:40| And all of that information is on each one of the signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=580)|
| 0:09:44| It's displayed on each one of the signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=584)|
| 0:09:46| And the text feature is very popular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=586)|
| 0:09:48| As soon as the information stickers went up on the signs in January,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=588)|
| 0:09:52| people were texting to find out when the next bus would arrive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=592)|
| 0:09:56| The number of text requests was 3,567 for the first month in January| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=596)|
| 0:10:02| and 6,529 so far here in the month of March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=602)|
| 0:10:07| The number one location for text requests so far is Knox Plaza.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=607)|
| 0:10:12| You got me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=612)|
| 0:10:15| But Pellissippi State on Division Street is second, followed by Clinch at Locust,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=615)|
| 0:10:21| Cumberland at Phillip Fullmer, and then the Coliseum stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=621)|
| 0:10:25| And Cat's ridership is trending up year-to-date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=625)|
| 0:10:28| We're averaging a quarter million trips on Cat each month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=628)|
| 0:10:32| And now that we have the new app features, we hope these numbers will continue to climb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=632)|
| 0:10:37| So we appreciate the mayor unveiling our app for us tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=637)|
| 0:10:42| and we encourage everybody to download it and use it and ride Cat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=642)|
| 0:10:46| That's great. Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=646)|
| 0:10:48| Thank you. Thank you to you and your team. Great work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=648)|
| 0:10:50| We really do appreciate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=650)|
| 0:10:52| Very exciting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=652)|
| 0:10:57| And last but not least, we have our annual report from PARC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=657)|
| 0:11:01| from our Police and Advisory Review Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=661)|
| 0:11:04| And I'm going to introduce Rosa Marr, who's the board chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=664)|
| 0:11:07| And you have one board member with you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=667)|
| 0:11:11| I actually have several.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=671)|
| 0:11:12| Oh, are they sitting other places?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=672)|
| 0:11:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=674)|
| 0:11:15| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=675)|
| 0:11:16| So I'd like to recognize them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=676)|
| 0:11:17| Okay. I see you back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=677)|
| 0:11:18| So we have LaKenya Middlebrook and Jared Crone and Miss Ann Barker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=678)|
| 0:11:24| They're all here with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=684)|
| 0:11:27| First, I want to thank the board for serving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=687)|
| 0:11:30| Really do appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=690)|
| 0:11:31| So does everyone have a copy of the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=691)|
| 0:11:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=694)|
| 0:11:35| Well, luckily, I'm not going to read the whole thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=695)|
| 0:11:37| So thank you, Mayor, City Council members, and Chief Eve Thomas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=697)|
| 0:11:43| who's been a pleasure to work with her this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=703)|
| 0:11:46| So starting with the first paragraph,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=706)|
| 0:11:49| enclosed is the 2018 annual report of the Police Advisory and Review Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=709)|
| 0:11:54| prepared in accordance with the City of Knoxville Ordinance Number 019401,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=714)|
| 0:11:59| adopting the Police Advisory Review Committee, approved on May 29th of 2001,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=719)|
| 0:12:06| which reminds me, we had our 20th anniversary party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=726)|
| 0:12:09| So I hope a lot of you were able to make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=729)|
| 0:12:12| Then in 2018, PARC received 85 cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=732)|
| 0:12:17| which is a decrease of one case from the previous year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=737)|
| 0:12:21| PARC closed a total of 87 cases, which included two cases pending from 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=741)|
| 0:12:27| One of the closed cases, 49 were resolved by the Executive Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=747)|
| 0:12:33| four were resolved through mediation by the Executive Director and KPD,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=753)|
| 0:12:39| 12 were referrals to appropriate agencies, and 22 were resolved by KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=759)|
| 0:12:45| Despite the ongoing turmoil surrounding citizen police divisiveness in many U.S. cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=765)|
| 0:12:52| the similarities in case numbers from 2018 suggest that the Knoxville community has faith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=772)|
| 0:12:58| that citizen concerns and complaints against KPD are being addressed fairly and comprehensively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=778)|
| 0:13:06| Despite this positive outlook, PARC pledges to maintain its vigilance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=786)|
| 0:13:11| in resolving issues and complaints to improve upon the relationship between KPD and the community it serves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=791)|
| 0:13:19| The next two paragraphs tell us what Clarence does on a daily basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=799)|
| 0:13:24| so I don't think we need to go through those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=804)|
| 0:13:26| Plus, I don't want to make his head any bigger than it already is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=806)|
| 0:13:29| So PARC members have reviewed and discussed during quarterly meetings a total of nine internal affairs cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=809)|
| 0:13:37| and six referral action forms provided by the Internal Affairs Unit of the Knoxville Police Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=817)|
| 0:13:44| When additional information was needed, PARC members submitted case evaluation forms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=824)|
| 0:13:50| with detailed questions pertaining to cases reviewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=830)|
| 0:13:54| The Knoxville Police Department Internal Affairs Unit has provided responses to the questions posed by the PARC members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=834)|
| 0:14:01| PARC members concurred with the findings in each of the cases reviewed for the period ending in 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=841)|
| 0:14:08| The leading nature of complaints were as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=848)|
| 0:14:11| Unprofessional conduct, citizen's advocate, and racial profiling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=851)|
| 0:14:17| The nature of complaints is outlined by the types of incidents reviewed by the Executive Director and PARC members in the addendum pages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=857)|
| 0:14:27| Throughout the year, the committee and the Executive Director strived to improve coordination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=867)|
| 0:14:32| and communication with the internal affairs and senior staff of KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=872)|
| 0:14:37| And now I'd like to jump to the next paragraph.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=877)|
| 0:14:40| PARC's 2018 quarterly meetings were held in various sectors of the city as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=880)|
| 0:14:46| South Community Center, E.V. Davidson Community Center, Lonsdale Community Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=886)|
| 0:14:52| and Knoxville County Public Defender's Community Law Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=892)|
| 0:14:56| Citizen attendance and participation has continued to improve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=896)|
| 0:15:00| and the dialogue between the committee, citizens, and KPD has been helpful and beneficial to all participants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=900)|
| 0:15:08| PARC has been very fortunate to have continued support of community leaders and citizens who attend the quarterly meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=908)|
| 0:15:16| I think the Chief has groupie fans, personally, but anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=916)|
| 0:15:22| Many of these regular attendees conduct their own recruitment efforts to increase the number of attendees for which PARC is very appreciative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=922)|
| 0:15:30| And I think one of the highlights of our meetings is that we have training sessions of which the police officers provide training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=930)|
| 0:15:38| And one of the most popular was what you should do and don't do when you are stopped by a police officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=938)|
| 0:15:45| The final paragraph, on a final note, please be assured that PARC strives to ensure that its procedures, operations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=945)|
| 0:15:53| and communications are always courteous, respectful, and in full compliance with the Tennessee Open Records Act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=953)|
| 0:16:01| as well as other statutes and ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=961)|
| 0:16:04| As always, the committee welcomes the input of the Mayor, City Council, Knoxville Police Department, and the citizens of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=964)|
| 0:16:13| Any concerns or issues raised will be addressed and responded to in a timely manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=973)|
| 0:16:18| Attached to this letter is a comparative report of matters addressed by PARC and its Executive Director for the years 2017 and 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=978)|
| 0:16:31| And one point that I'd like to also make is that both Clarence Vaughn and Avis have been consulted by other cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=991)|
| 0:16:40| who have been wanting to set up their own citizens review board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1000)|
| 0:16:44| And I'm very pleased that Knoxville can say we started it 20 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1004)|
| 0:16:49| So if you have any questions, both Clarence and I and the rest of the PARC committee are here to address them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1009)|
| 0:16:56| Thank you, Rosa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1016)|
| 0:16:57| And I do want to recognize Clarence Vaughn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1017)|
| 0:16:59| Please stand up, Clarence, for the great job you do as our Director there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1019)|
| 0:17:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1022)|
| 0:17:06| Are there any questions right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1026)|
| 0:17:08| You all can read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1028)|
| 0:17:11| Councilwoman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1031)|
| 0:17:12| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1032)|
| 0:17:13| I just want to just commend the Executive Director, the committee members, and also Ms. Reed in the work that you all have done for the past 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1033)|
| 0:17:23| We see cases on the national news every night pretty much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1043)|
| 0:17:29| And even though I think we are very diligent and intentional from the KPD's perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1049)|
| 0:17:34| we are just one incident from being on the national news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1054)|
| 0:17:38| And so I think it is through that collaborative effort and having PARC in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1058)|
| 0:17:42| where people feel like there's an additional advocate for them to be heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1062)|
| 0:17:46| and for due process to be conducted fairly and equitably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1066)|
| 0:17:51| So, again, I just want to thank you all for your commitment and the work that you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1071)|
| 0:17:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1075)|
| 0:17:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1076)|
| 0:17:57| Councilwoman Singh-Perez.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1077)|
| 0:17:59| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1079)|

| 0:18:05| in trying to keep PARC with the subpoena powers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1085)|
| 0:18:08| I really appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1088)|

| 0:18:22| Okay, council, we will move on in our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1102)|
| 0:18:29| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1109)|

| 0:18:35| Yes, that's next on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1115)|
| 0:18:39| Vice Mayor Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1119)|
| 0:18:40| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1120)|
| 0:18:41| I just wanted to remind people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1121)|
| 0:18:42| Takes a village.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1122)|
| 0:18:45| I just wanted to remind everybody, everybody other than council who already know about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1125)|
| 0:18:49| that on April the 4th we will have our third and I believe final workshop on the recode proposal for Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1129)|
| 0:18:56| Here at 530 April the 4th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1136)|

| 0:19:03| Councilwoman Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1143)|
| 0:19:04| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1144)|
| 0:19:05| I just want to make sure that everyone on council is aware and anyone in the audience as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1145)|
| 0:19:10| that there's a meeting tomorrow evening in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1150)|
| 0:19:14| It's being hosted by the Vestal Community Organization, myself and CAC South Knox Renew Our Neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1154)|
| 0:19:22| This is a conversation on homelessness and representatives from several city departments will be there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1162)|
| 0:19:29| including the Office on Homelessness, the Police Department, Codes Enforcement, the Office of Neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1169)|
| 0:19:35| along with CAC's Renew Our Neighborhoods program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1175)|
| 0:19:41| Really, this meeting was planned in response to some constituent questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1181)|
| 0:19:50| and concerns that have been raised to me in South Knoxville following the opening of the safe space under the bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1190)|
| 0:20:00| I know that other districts are facing similar issues with dispersion of homeless persons throughout the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1200)|
| 0:20:08| I think this will be a great information-sharing meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1208)|
| 0:20:11| I think it's an opportunity for people to learn about some of the proactive approaches that the city is already deploying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1211)|
| 0:20:19| to address really a very serious issue of homelessness that's not just facing Knoxville but all across our country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1219)|
| 0:20:26| and an opportunity for constituents to have their concerns addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1226)|
| 0:20:31| Anyone is invited to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1231)|
| 0:20:33| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1233)|
| 0:20:34| I probably didn't say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1234)|
| 0:20:36| It's at 5.30 p.m., and it will be held at the South Knoxville Community Center in the gymnasium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1236)|
| 0:20:42| That's at 522 Merrillville Pike, 5.30 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1242)|
| 0:20:48| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1248)|
| 0:20:50| Now we'll move on to ordinances on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1250)|
| 0:20:53| 9A is an ordinance to amend the operating and capital budgets for fiscal year 18-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1253)|
| 0:20:59| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1259)|
| 0:21:00| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1260)|
| 0:21:01| Vice Mayor Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1261)|
| 0:21:02| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1262)|
| 0:21:03| I just wanted to offer on this item, on the Item 12, the Low Barrier Night Shelter Project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1263)|
| 0:21:13| Bert Rosen called me from CARM and expressed support for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1273)|
| 0:21:20| He had questioned me the week before, and I don't see Bert here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1280)|
| 0:21:24| I know he wanted to come and make a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1284)|
| 0:21:27| Is Bert here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1287)|
| 0:21:29| Are you going to make a comment in Bert's place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1289)|
| 0:21:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1291)|
| 0:21:32| If you would come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1292)|
| 0:21:34| Oh, this is Danita McCartney?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1294)|
| 0:21:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1296)|
| 0:21:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1297)|
| 0:21:38| Give us your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1298)|
| 0:21:40| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1300)|
| 0:21:41| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1301)|
| 0:21:42| I'm Danita McCartney with CARM 418 North Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1302)|
| 0:21:48| Thank you for allowing me a few minutes to address you this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1308)|
| 0:21:53| CARM supports the proposal before you and believes a new low barrier shelter can help serve those who are homeless in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1313)|
| 0:22:00| However, in some of the discussion about the proposal, where references have been made about CARM,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1320)|
| 0:22:07| some things have been said that are accurate, and I would like to correct those tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1327)|
| 0:22:12| One, while low barrier is a relatively new term being used locally, it's not a new concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1332)|
| 0:22:19| CARM is a low barrier facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1339)|
| 0:22:22| We do not require a religious participation for those who stay in our shelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1342)|
| 0:22:27| We do offer chapel services nightly and strive to make them inviting and appealing for those people who choose to participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1347)|
| 0:22:36| Nor does CARM require a sobriety to stay in the shelter so as long as the individual is not deemed a danger to themselves or others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1356)|
| 0:22:47| An intoxicated person who can sleep it off would be permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1367)|
| 0:22:52| However, we will administer a breathalyzer to a person who is visibly intoxicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1372)|
| 0:22:57| This is a precaution for their health and safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1377)|
| 0:23:00| We are in full agreement that some people will prefer a smaller shelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1380)|
| 0:23:05| There are those with mental challenges that make it difficult or even nearly impossible to be in a large group of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1385)|
| 0:23:12| There has also been talk about the new shelter called the foyer being built around safety first and foremost as opposed to rule compliant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1392)|
| 0:23:21| Let me share with you the actual rules we have at CARM.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1401)|
| 0:23:25| CARM operates a clean, safe, and wholesome environment with constant attention to guest safety and security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1405)|
| 0:23:34| Further, we operate on a grace-based versus rules-based structure that allows us to counsel people through issues versus punitive action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1414)|
| 0:23:44| All overnight guests and residential program participants are expected to honor a few basic rules of cooperation and decency with regard to nonviolent behavior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1424)|
| 0:23:55| Another point for clarification is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1435)|
| 0:23:58| The new shelter has stated it will not compete with CARM, but acts as a place for homeless if they are addicts, have pets, or are a couple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1438)|
| 0:24:07| At CARM, a homeless addict who comes to us is rapidly directed to a recovery program option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1447)|
| 0:24:13| We welcome them, but do not allow them to use drugs or consume alcohol while staying overnight with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1453)|
| 0:24:20| And at CARM, we do not accept pets, but we do make provisions for service animals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1460)|
| 0:24:26| And couples are welcome at CARM, but are not permitted to share a bed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1466)|
| 0:24:31| Another point that has been shared is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1471)|
| 0:24:33| We need something. CARM is constantly at capacity or beyond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1473)|
| 0:24:39| That is just not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1479)|
| 0:24:41| During the peak of summer heat or winter cold, we do sometimes reach capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1481)|
| 0:24:47| Should this occur, some of our guests will spend the night with partnering churches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1487)|
| 0:24:52| Not one person has ever been turned away for lack of space. Not one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1492)|
| 0:24:57| And like we said before, we welcome this new shelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1497)|
| 0:25:01| Obviously, this is a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1501)|
| 0:25:04| But as I am sure you're aware, CARM...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1504)|
| 0:25:07| I'm sorry, I skipped ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1507)|
| 0:25:09| A news article said that during the day, the foyer will be focused on connecting people with housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1509)|
| 0:25:14| Obviously, this is a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1514)|
| 0:25:16| But as I'm sure you're aware, CARM, VMC, CAC, and Salvation Army are already doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1516)|
| 0:25:24| I appreciate the opportunity to address you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1524)|
| 0:25:27| And I'm happy to voice CARM's support for this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1527)|
| 0:25:30| And I invite each of you to come and visit CARM if you haven't had the opportunity to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1530)|
| 0:25:34| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1534)|
| 0:25:36| Thank you very much. Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1536)|
| 0:25:38| Okay, any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1538)|

| 0:27:45| We have Commissioner Carringer who made this request here to speak on this, so I'll let| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1665)|

| 0:28:20| so much. There might be more at home sitting up here. I thought it was great. I'm very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1700)|
| 0:28:30| humbled and I'm very honored to be able to have been the person to be able to apply for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1710)|
| 0:28:37| the honorary name change from Marion Drive to Coach Rosser Drive. I felt like as the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1717)|
| 0:28:47| community that this would be a great way to honor him for all the great work that he and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1727)|
| 0:28:53| his staff are doing in making a difference in so many young people's lives every day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1733)|
| 0:28:58| at Central High School as well as the whole community. And Coach Bryson Rosser is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1738)|
| 0:29:07| first coach in 112 years of the history of Central High School to ever bring home the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1747)|
| 0:29:15| gold trophy. So, that in itself is just totally amazing. And I just want to say one thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1755)|
| 0:29:24| and this is, he was also voted as the five-star preps coach of the year. Very, he's just so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1764)|
| 0:29:33| respected by everybody. And once you meet him, I mean, he's so contagious. And his wife| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1773)|
| 0:29:39| Brooke also works with Knox County Schools over here. But the one statement that he says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1779)|
| 0:29:45| that I just, I love, he says, everything I do is based on the impact I can have on kids. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1785)|
| 0:29:55| absolutely love every single kid on our roster. The beautiful part of high school football is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1795)|
| 0:30:05| that clientele doesn't change. We do. You've got to continue to relate to the 14 to 18| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1805)|
| 0:30:14| year olds. And to me, that just really sums it all up about all of us in our everyday life. That| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1814)|
| 0:30:22| it's so important that we continue in whatever profession or that we do every day to relate to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1822)|
| 0:30:30| those kids that are 14 to 18 years old, our most precious and vulnerable at that time of your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1830)|
| 0:30:38| life. So I want to thank Councilman Lauren Ryder for steering me and directing me and Will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1838)|
| 0:30:44| city recorder, and helping me to know the steps to go about this. And I truly appreciate it if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1844)|
| 0:30:54| it's your all's will to okay and change the honorary name of Marion Drive, which runs right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1854)|
| 0:31:04| into the back of Central's football stadium, into the campus, which is kind of unusual. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1864)|
| 0:31:11| city street runs right into the campus there and makes a little dead end right there. So I'm here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1871)|
| 0:31:20| to speak on that behalf and any questions or anything, I'll be happy to try to. Great. Thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1880)|
| 0:31:27| you very much. Any questions? Councilwoman Ryder? I just wanted to comment. Is this still a surprise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1887)|
| 0:31:32| I think it pretty is still a surprise because I talked to his wife the other day and she was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1892)|
| 0:31:41| surprised. So JD knew that I was coming up here tonight. So yeah, we're really hoping. This was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1901)|
| 0:31:50| it also was something two years ago when he took him to the state and I said, well what do you want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1910)|
| 0:31:57| to do? Where do you want to go if you win the state, Coach Rosser? And he says, I just like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1917)|
| 0:32:02| have that street named after me. And so when he took him back this year, I said, what do you want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1922)|
| 0:32:08| to do if you get it this year? That same request that we talked about two years ago. So I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1928)|
| 0:32:14| we're on it. So but he's a very humble person and I just can't think of a better person to to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1934)|
| 0:32:21| that street honorary named after. If you've not met him, I'd like for y'all to get the opportunity to meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1941)|
| 0:32:29| him sometime. Great. All right. Well, thank you very much. So we have a motion and a second. All in favor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1949)|
| 0:32:36| say aye. Aye. Any opposed? The ayes have it and so ordered. Thank you. And Councilman Ryder, we will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1956)|
| 0:32:42| need to go do something to surprise him with this. My husband texted me unless he's watching| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1962)|

| 0:33:18| I served with Wanda Moody for eight years. She served for more than eight years, but for my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=1998)|
| 0:33:24| eight years from 1990 to 98 on County Commission, we served together and often sat next to each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=2004)|
| 0:33:31| other actually right over there. And I thought she's very well deserving. She's a woman who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=2011)|
| 0:33:38| had a lot of guts, took on a lot of tough issues, and really served her constituents well. So I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=2018)|
| 0:33:46| very pleased to see this request from Congressman Burchett and that the committee is recommending it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=2026)|
| 0:33:51| now. I'll just comment that he did attend the Public Property Naming Committee and spoke on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=2031)|
| 0:33:57| behalf of the agenda item, but I imagine that he must be in D.C. Right. I was guessing. Doing what he's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=2037)|

| 0:35:23| wanted to ask Ms. Wade a couple questions if we had a chance. This is something that we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=2123)|
| 0:35:29| continually gotten this grant and this is a way that we can help support folks from falling into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=2129)|
| 0:35:34| homelessness. Good evening everybody. Becky Wade, Director of Community Development. This is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=2134)|

| 0:35:46| that goes to the state of Tennessee and THDA administers this. They set aside a certain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=2146)|
| 0:35:53| amount of funds for the city of Knoxville and then we apply for those funds. These specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=2153)|
| 0:36:00| funds will be used for what's called rapid rehousing services and so we have two partner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=2160)|
| 0:36:06| agencies that we sub grant with that will be implementing those activities. Okay and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=2166)|
| 0:36:13| intent is to keep folks from that are in danger of falling into homelessness. They're actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=2173)|
| 0:36:18| homeless persons that are rapidly rehoused is the term and so these funds can be used for case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=2178)|

| 0:39:27| since this is, we first voted on this some time back and there's been several amendments as we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=2367)|
| 0:39:33| gone along, could you give us just an update on the numbers and do the numbers still work and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=2373)|
| 0:39:41| exactly how, where we are on this whole project? I will defer to Erin Gill on a big picture look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=2381)|
| 0:39:49| at all the contracts we've been doing on this. She's got a better grasp of the big picture. Okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=2389)|
| 0:39:54| perfect. So, here she is. Erin Gill, Director of Sustainability, Honorary Member of the Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=2394)|
| 0:40:02| of Engineering. So, you are correct. You have seen several agreements come before you regarding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=2402)|
| 0:40:10| ServiceOne and the maintenance of the street lighting system. Those have been for the contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=2410)|
| 0:40:15| that covered April of 2018 through about mid-April 2019. So, everything you've seen previously have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=2415)|
| 0:40:21| been covering kind of the 12 months behind us. This contract that you have in front of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=2421)|
| 0:40:25| tonight will cover the 12 months in front of us starting in April 2019. So, it's actually supplanting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=2425)|
| 0:40:30| the contract that you voted on in the past. In terms of numbers, you'll notice that the $1.2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=2430)|
| 0:40:36| million is lower than the current contract amount of $1.5 and that reflects the reduction in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=2436)|
| 0:40:42| number of service requests as a result of the retrofit. That being said, we do feel that that $1.2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=2442)|
| 0:40:47| is actually still quite conservative and leaves a very healthy buffer given that we are still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=2447)|
| 0:40:51| partially, only partially through the retrofit itself. We've talked a lot internally about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=2451)|
| 0:40:57| and we would expect to see that number track continuing downward. So, the idea with this $1.2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=2457)|
| 0:41:02| amount is that we don't come back to you for a change order within the next 12 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=2462)|
| 0:41:07| Boldly says that we're going to save $2 million a year. I mean, do those numbers still...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=2467)|
| 0:41:11| They do. So, if you recall kind of the situation in April of 2018 was that we were paying KUB a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=2471)|
| 0:41:21| facilities charge. In 2017, that facilities charge totaled $2.3 million and that entire facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=2481)|
| 0:41:27| charge has been eliminated from our bill. So, we are no longer paying that at all. Now, part of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=2487)|
| 0:41:31| is that we have to use those savings to now pay this new contract amount. So, in that regard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=2491)|
| 0:41:36| the new savings with service, or this new contract with service one as well as the old contract with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=2496)|
| 0:41:40| service one, that is all fully covered by the savings that we are achieving on our bill as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=2500)|
| 0:41:44| result of that big shift in how we manage the billing with KUB. We expect on our April bill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=2504)|
| 0:41:52| with KUB, we will actually also start seeing the LED energy savings kick in and those will track| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=2512)|
| 0:41:58| downward as we move through the retrofit and complete it. It should be substantially complete| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=2518)|
| 0:42:03| by June of this year and when it is fully complete, we would expect to see a 60% reduction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=2523)|
| 0:42:09| in the energy charge component, which is that one remaining portion of our bill. So, all that said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=2529)|
| 0:42:14| yes, we will firmly be within the realm of the projected savings. The $2 million figure that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=2534)|
| 0:42:19| have used when I talk about that program, that is a net saving. So, that actually already backs out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=2539)|
| 0:42:24| the roughly $1 million of ongoing maintenance that we would expect to occur. So, the KUB bill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=2544)|
| 0:42:29| will actually be reduced by closer to about $3 million and then when you back in the maintenance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=2549)|
| 0:42:33| costs that we incur going forward, then the net savings is $2 million. And so, it is a $10 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=2553)|
| 0:42:39| project. We hope to save, I think that was, hope to save $2 million a year. So, one of it will be on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=2559)|
| 0:42:44| energy reduction of a million and the maintenance cost from $2.3 million to $1.2 million. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=2564)|
| 0:42:52| there is another million. And then where is the third million come? You are saying? So, it is $2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=2572)|
| 0:42:55| million in net savings. That is $2 million. That is your net savings right there. So, that was how we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=2575)|
| 0:43:00| got to, it would pay itself back in five years. Exactly. Yeah, and the total project amount just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=2580)|
| 0:43:06| based on what you guys have already approved is actually closer to about $15.5 million. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=2586)|
| 0:43:11| the payback that we are looking at is that $7.5 million kind of year frame. I think we have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=2591)|
| 0:43:16| talking in the terms of under $10 million, which is the warranty of the light. So, it is well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=2596)|
| 0:43:20| matched in that regard. We have another agenda item coming up on tree removal and maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=2600)|
| 0:43:25| So, all that was, these are all factored in in the original proposal. This is nothing new or not a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=2605)|
| 0:43:32| surprise. Exactly right. So, the tree trimming contract that you will talk about later, that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=2612)|
| 0:43:39| capital. So, that is not coming out of the ongoing maintenance. That is actually a capital request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=2619)|
| 0:43:42| associated directly with the retrofit itself. And all of that is budgeted under the existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=2622)|
| 0:43:48| capital budget account that has already been authorized. So, this $1.2 million, it is actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=2628)|
| 0:43:53| coming out of engineering. And the next one comes, the trees come out of sustainability. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=2633)|
| 0:43:58| when will this all flip over to engineering or will it always be an honorary member of engineering?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=2638)|
| 0:44:05| Yes, probably. So, when the retrofit capital project is completed, which again, that is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=2645)|
| 0:44:12| substantive completion date in June, which inevitably the contract itself will probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=2652)|
| 0:44:16| be extended, but at no cost presumably, just to kind of get those punch list items finished out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=2656)|
| 0:44:22| But all that said, when that capital project is complete, then it will firmly be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=2662)|
| 0:44:27| engineering system to manage going forward. Okay. You are working yourself out of a job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=2667)|
| 0:44:32| You know, when you are trying to work on sustainability, that is a good problem to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=2672)|
| 0:44:36| have. That is good. Okay. Thank you for that update. Now, as you all know, we are working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=2676)|
| 0:44:39| on new goals for sustainability. So, when she finishes that, she will have quite a bit more to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=2679)|

| 0:47:25| to have an explanation of what's going on here, what the problem is in Fort Sanders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=2845)|
| 0:47:30| and how that compares with other neighborhoods and downtown. Sure. Chad Weth, Public Service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=2850)|
| 0:47:36| Director. I think Fort Sanders is a very unique neighborhood as most of you are probably aware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=2856)|
| 0:47:40| I think it's dense population and the transient population that exists in Fort Sanders has made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=2860)|
| 0:47:47| the more contents of cart and the recycling carts a little bit more of a challenge. Patience Melnick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=2867)|
| 0:47:53| our Solid Waste Manager, is here as well. But we've, you know, education is hard when you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=2873)|
| 0:47:58| a very transient population that comes in and out in a year. And what we found is really... We're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=2878)|
| 0:48:03| talking about students here. Yeah, student population. I'm sorry. Yes. Not everybody's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=2883)|
| 0:48:08| moving away, of course. The student population is very hard to educate and to kind of change the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=2888)|
| 0:48:13| way we do trash. I know that sounds funny too, doesn't it? So this is something that we were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=2893)|
| 0:48:18| concerned with when we first kicked off the program. But I would say that, again, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=2898)|
| 0:48:22| of the dense nature of Fort Sanders, we've noticed an increase in litter and most neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=2902)|
| 0:48:28| we've definitely noticed a decrease in litter. And so how does that differ in how we treat trash| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=2908)|
| 0:48:33| downtown for the residential community downtown? Well, downtown is different in a lot of ways. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=2913)|
| 0:48:38| actually, as city staff, still pick up trash downtown and we pick up trash every day. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=2918)|
| 0:48:43| downtown is, again, totally separate. I would, again, say you're right though. The reason why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=2923)|
| 0:48:48| we do that is because it is such a dense population and much more challenging than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=2928)|
| 0:48:52| regular single-family home neighborhoods. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Any other? Okay. So we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=2932)|

| 0:49:33| you might come forward just a moment. I guess I'm not really concerned about this and I am| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=2973)|
| 0:49:39| supportive of it but my question is, is 90 days sufficient? Did you hear what happened? Yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=2979)|
| 0:49:46| Rick Dover, 4921 Humberg. Yes, we believe it will, Vice Mayor Saunders. We have cleared a number of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=2986)|
| 0:49:53| hurdles in the last few months with the replat, the correction of the right-of-way, correction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=2993)|
| 0:50:00| of boundaries, etc., but we still remain with something, a downstream stormwater study that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3000)|
| 0:50:09| has yet to be reviewed and commented on and just so that we understand what we're dealing with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3009)|
| 0:50:13| there. There's also a BZA variance that we hope once engineering comes back with comments that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3013)|
| 0:50:21| they'll support the agenda item for BZA that likely can't be heard now until the May meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3021)|
| 0:50:29| and then Municap is still doing an analysis on the financial needs of the building, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3029)|
| 0:50:35| of two buildings. So, to answer your question, yes, I think we've narrowed down the scope of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3035)|
| 0:50:41| all the things that had to happen prior to closing to just two or three and 90 days should be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3041)|
| 0:50:46| sufficient to get that done and we certainly don't want to be delaying, we didn't want to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3046)|
| 0:50:52| delayed to this point, but it is what it is. I mean, we had to do a traffic impact study, we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3052)|
| 0:50:57| to do, you know, resurvey, replat the property, etc., etc., so it's been complicated, but it just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3057)|
| 0:51:04| is what it is, so it just, it takes as long as it takes, but I, you know, we've been at this for two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3064)|
| 0:51:09| years now and we very much appreciate everybody working together, but another 90-day extension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3069)|
| 0:51:16| hopefully the last, is where we are. Thank you. Yes, sir. Thank you. We'll keep working together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3076)|
| 0:51:21| to get this done. Yes, yes. All right, so we have a motion and a second. All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3081)|

| 0:52:40| something just didn't seem right and I think what it was is that most of the time the people that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3160)|
| 0:52:45| I'm working with or my friends were talking about a living wage or a family wage and this isn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3165)|
| 0:52:51| what the category that this is in at all. Also in Bloomberg they started there was a posting about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3171)|
| 0:53:02| Knoxville being the third worst city of income inequality right now. That's pretty serious stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3182)|
| 0:53:10| I mean I know they probably got it wrong but that's still pretty high up. The last point I'd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3190)|
| 0:53:15| like to make is about did why are we doing this? Did anybody talk to the mayoral candidates to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3195)|
| 0:53:23| if they would have run or not run with this race? I called a couple of them up and they said they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3203)|
| 0:53:28| didn't care. So why are we just giving away money when there's no reason to? Thank you. Vice Mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3208)|
| 0:53:35| Saunders. Yeah, thank you mayor. You know running the city and I think this mayor, our current mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3215)|
| 0:53:40| would agree with this, this is an enormous task. You in fact are running a corporation and it's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3220)|
| 0:53:46| rather large corporation. Keep in mind we've got about 1600 employees. We have a budget of over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3226)|
| 0:53:54| 300 million dollars and a pension liability of over 750 million dollars. This is in fact a large| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3234)|
| 0:54:02| corporation that is being operated here and I think given those few facts right there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3242)|
| 0:54:09| this is well justified. As a matter of fact it may be on the low end. Remember that the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3249)|
| 0:54:14| unlike if you read the New Sentinel this morning, there was an article in there about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3254)|
| 0:54:18| Mr. David Zosloff, I believe his name is. Zosloff. Zosloff, okay. He makes 129 million dollars a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3258)|
| 0:54:28| 129 million running Discovery who is headquartered here in Knoxville. That is 1511 times his median| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3268)|
| 0:54:40| salary in that company. What is being suggested here is about three times the median salary and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3280)|
| 0:54:51| probably seven times that of the lowest salary in our organization. Remember again, Mr. Zosloff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3291)|
| 0:55:02| if he were to walk down Gay Street, probably nobody would recognize him and nobody would speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3302)|
| 0:55:08| to him except that we're friendly people and so we would say hello. On the other hand, when the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3308)|
| 0:55:12| mayor goes to coffee at Pete's, everybody in that organization in that place knows the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3312)|
| 0:55:19| whoever the mayor is, and probably speaks and often wants a selfie. This last weekend was big ears| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3319)|
| 0:55:28| and just about everywhere I went, I saw the mayor. By the way, this does not impact me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3328)|
| 0:55:34| This, yeah, and I'll get the salaries for the next mayor, but thank you. I'm getting there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3334)|
| 0:55:42| But everywhere the mayor goes, he or she is known and is spoken to and so the mayor is on 24-7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3342)|
| 0:55:52| I, on the other hand, while they knew the mayor, whoever they were, and many of them were from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3352)|
| 0:55:56| out of town, they had no clue who I was and that suited me just fine, by the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3356)|
| 0:56:02| but it was a good thing. Remember again what the mayor just indicated. There are no raises,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3362)|
| 0:56:08| annual raises, which occur for all of our employees except the mayor and city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3368)|
| 0:56:14| and you'll recall we passed an ordinance some time ago to raise the wages or the pay of city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3374)|
| 0:56:20| council to $24,000 beginning next year, and that's when this would take effect as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3380)|
| 0:56:26| So I think this is something that is well justified. If you looked at the wages of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3386)|
| 0:56:32| mayors of surrounding areas, our mayor is not only the lowest, he's way the lowest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3392)|
| 0:56:39| or the position is way the lowest in this area, and even this, even this increase will only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3399)|
| 0:56:45| make it a little higher, but it'll still be the lowest of all that we surveyed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3405)|
| 0:56:49| So this is certainly not done to attract people to run for the office, but it is a huge job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3409)|
| 0:56:56| and that was not a consideration, because I don't think anybody, none of us ran for the salary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3416)|
| 0:57:02| and Mayor Rejero certainly did not run for the salary, but it is a huge job and I think deserves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3422)|
| 0:57:07| to be compensated properly and in that group that we did survey. So thank you. Hope you will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3427)|
| 0:57:14| support it. Thank you. Councilman Steyer. Thank you, Mayor. I am a candidate for mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3434)|
| 0:57:20| at least I hope most of you know that, and I certainly didn't request it, but just don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3440)|
| 0:57:27| think it's right to vote on it, so I'll be abstaining. Okay, thank you. Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3447)|
| 0:57:32| Thank you, Mayor. I agree with Vice Mayor Saunders. I mean, this is not about trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3452)|
| 0:57:38| attract somebody to the job, it's about trying to pay somebody fairly for the job that they're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3458)|
| 0:57:43| and we voted one council back, we voted for an increase for the mayor, so if she was elected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3463)|
| 0:57:51| and you were, or whoever would have been elected, and it's not subject to the annual increase that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3471)|
| 0:57:58| every other employee is, so for that it has to come for this, and that's the way the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3478)|
| 0:58:04| charter's written. So I think it's fairly compensated. There's certainly people in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3484)|
| 0:58:09| comparable positions in private practice and in quasi-government jobs that are making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3489)|
| 0:58:16| substantially more, and it's about fair compensation for the job at hand, and I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3496)|
| 0:58:22| think there's any other job where you work 24-7 with that kind of budget and the number of employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3502)|
| 0:58:28| and I think it's a saying, hey, this is an important job. We've had mayors that have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3508)|
| 0:58:33| declined a salary, and that's certainly an option for the next one, so you can decline it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3513)|
| 0:58:40| Keep that in mind, Mr. Speier, you can decline it. I'll have to talk to my wife and family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3520)|
| 0:58:48| It is an option, but anyway, I think it's about fair compensation for the fair job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3528)|
| 0:58:52| and so I definitely support it. Thank you. Councilman Roberto. Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3532)|
| 0:58:57| I want to take this opportunity to thank our hard-working city employees who serve our city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3537)|
| 0:59:01| incredibly well. I know I see several of you out in the audience today. They're serving us in many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3541)|
| 0:59:07| difficult roles, including as police officers, firefighters, in public service, among others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3547)|
| 0:59:13| These men and women have received a two-and-a-half percent cost of living increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3553)|
| 0:59:19| every year since 2015, except last year where they got a half percent increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3559)|
| 0:59:25| While I support paying the mayor a salary that is reflective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3565)|
| 0:59:34| of the scope and the complexity of this role, which I would agree with all of the speakers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3574)|
| 0:59:40| here tonight with what they had said, I can't support a 14 percent increase when our hard-working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3580)|
| 0:59:45| city employees receive a two-and-a-half percent increase for all the ways they serve us, so I'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3585)|
| 0:59:50| have to be voting no. Thank you. Councilwoman McKenzie. Thank you. I'm not sure who I need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3590)|
| 0:59:58| direct this question to, but we don't need to have names or anything, but are there city employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3598)|
| 1:00:04| that report to the mayor that make more than the amount that we are proposing? Yes. And the increase?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3604)|
| 1:00:12| There are six, I believe. Yes. Okay. Most of the cabinet. Okay. And does anyone know the history as to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3612)|
| 1:00:22| And others, not just cabinet, but others, yeah. Okay. And does anyone know the history as to why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3622)|
| 1:00:28| we have never set, this body has never set, some type of review for salary for the mayor's position?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3628)|
| 1:00:36| I don't know. I think, doesn't the county mayor have an automatic escalator somehow? The county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3636)|
| 1:00:42| mayor is tied to some state law relative to the population of the county. All right. So I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3642)|
| 1:00:50| know the history. I don't know if Jim York knows any of the history of how these were set in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3650)|
| 1:00:54| past, but I don't think he does. Do you, Jim? No. Okay. There's not been, to my knowledge, a regular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3654)|
| 1:01:03| type of review every now and then. Somebody, I think it was raised maybe at the end of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3663)|
| 1:01:09| Victor Ashe's term, and then... Go ahead. Do you know? It was, as Mayor Ashe was going out the door| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3669)|
| 1:01:19| before the election, it was raised from, I believe it was $99,000 to I think $130,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3679)|
| 1:01:27| I think it was $110,000 at that time. Excuse me. Mayor Haslam did not accept a salary for his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3687)|
| 1:01:33| approximate six and a half years, and then it stayed at that until four years ago, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3693)|
| 1:01:40| when it was raised to the... No, I think when I came in, it had been set in 2011. So apparently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3700)|
| 1:01:48| before I won election, it was set at $130,000. $130,000. And then the year that I ran for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3708)|
| 1:01:54| re-election... 2015. Right, 2015. It was set so for whoever would have won, it would be $142,500,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3714)|
| 1:02:02| and that's the current salary. Another thing to consider, excuse me, I didn't know, were you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3722)|
| 1:02:09| finished? Okay. Another thing to consider, the mayor going forward will not qualify for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3729)|
| 1:02:17| pension plan. Right now, Ms. Rajero will qualify for the pension plan, but going forward, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3737)|
| 1:02:26| pension plan doesn't vest for 10 years now, and the mayor's limited to two four-year terms. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3746)|
| 1:02:33| they will not ever be on the pension plan. That doesn't mean they won't contribute. They'll get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3753)|
| 1:02:38| a little bit of something, but they won't have a pension. So this, and I agree with Councilman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3758)|
| 1:02:44| Wallace, I think this is well-deserved. This is a huge responsibility, and I think we need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3764)|
| 1:02:50| recognize that and compensate in a fair manner. Councilwoman Ryder. I know that, you know, in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3770)|
| 1:02:58| light of conversations that we have about recruiting for things like our uniformed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3778)|
| 1:03:03| offices, this is a difficult conversation and something not to take lightly. So of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3783)|
| 1:03:09| I did some math and some research, and some other folks did research and sent me numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3789)|
| 1:03:13| I do want to clarify one comment that was just made before I get into that. If a future mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3793)|
| 1:03:20| for instance, Mayor Rajero, had served as a city employee for a number of years prior to becoming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3800)|
| 1:03:25| mayor, those years of combined service do total to count towards someone being counted, they would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3805)|
| 1:03:33| be eligible for the pension? Because if someone just became mayor and had not served as a city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3813)|
| 1:03:38| employee, is it based on years of service? Yeah, that's actually correct, and Mr. York can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3818)|
| 1:03:45| explain it to you. Mr. York, clarify and make sure that we're not speaking out of turn. Okay. I think it would depend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3825)|
| 1:03:51| on which plan they were in. If they were in an HG plan or an H plan. Can't you give an easy answer to anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3831)|
| 1:03:59| There are no easy answers. There are no easy answers when it comes to pensions. Okay. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3839)|
| 1:04:04| if you were a member of either C plan or G plan prior to becoming mayor, I think you would still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3844)|
| 1:04:16| still be eligible. Again, and that's kind of your service might be actually terminated at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3856)|
| 1:04:23| point in time. If you were an H, a member of H, I don't think that would be the case. Which is the reform plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3863)|
| 1:04:28| Which is the new plan. Okay. So the C plan is the old uniform plan, and the G plan is the old| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3868)|
| 1:04:36| general government plan, but the H plans are the new uniform plan, and I think that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3876)|
| 1:04:41| what's covered. Again, it gets kind of tricky. I'm not sure. The H plan is not everyone, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3881)|
| 1:04:50| Anyone hired after 2000 and January 1st of 2013 is in an H plan. They're actually, that's actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3890)|
| 1:04:58| we have an H uniformed and an H general government. They have slightly different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3898)|
| 1:05:02| different plans. So if you had two years or 10 years of service and you were part of the H plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3902)|
| 1:05:08| and you somehow became mayor, I'm sorry, if you had less than X number of... If you have less, if you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3908)|
| 1:05:15| not vested at that point, I think you would not be able to receive a pension. I'm not even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3915)|
| 1:05:22| sure that you would be able to receive... Let's say you were vested. I believe that you would still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3922)|
| 1:05:29| be able to receive a pension, but it would not include the mayoral years of service. And again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3929)|
| 1:05:36| I'd have to go back and research that, but I think that would be the case. But you would have to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3936)|
| 1:05:40| vested in the plan. Okay. So doing the math, one of the complicated things about the salary is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3940)|
| 1:05:50| when Haslam was mayor, he didn't take a salary. So that kind of stagnated it for close to eight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3950)|
| 1:05:56| years. But if you go back and you look and you say 2003 was $130,000, and then you do a 1%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3956)|
| 1:06:03| annum increase on that number during those years that it stagnated, by 2020, which is next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3963)|
| 1:06:12| compounding at a 1% annum increase, you would end up at $153,959. So let's go ahead and just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3972)|
| 1:06:18| round that up, the dollar-ish or 40-some dollars, whatever there, and get it to 154. So I think one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3978)|
| 1:06:25| of my questions in this being proposed to us is where did the number get a... Where did it come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3985)|
| 1:06:31| from to be proposed in this? Because the city employs, when the salary survey happens, there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=3991)|
| 1:06:40| are 33 cities that go into that. And we are looking at four or five. I will say that when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4000)|
| 1:06:48| you take a number of other cities with similar sizes that were sent to me, I think there were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4008)|
| 1:06:54| 14 that are computed throughout the highest, throughout the lowest, because that's how the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4014)|
| 1:06:57| salary survey goes. The number ends up being, when you average those all out, it ends up being 142| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4017)|
| 1:07:05| or 144. So if you look at it historically, go back to 2003 and compound it up to next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4025)|
| 1:07:12| you'd be at 154. But if you do the math and look at a larger number of cities, you'd be at 144.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4032)|
| 1:07:20| So where did we get the number that's proposed is really kind of my question. Yeah, I was the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4040)|
| 1:07:25| one who came up with that number, and I did it by looking at the survey that I asked Mr. Johnson to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4045)|
| 1:07:31| do, which you should have a copy of, that looked at Asheville, North Carolina, Chattanooga, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4051)|
| 1:07:38| Greenville, South Carolina, Knox County Mayor, Knoxville, Tennessee Mayor, and Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4058)|
| 1:07:45| And we were at, like I say, the bottom there, and we will remain so if this prevails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4065)|
| 1:07:51| Councilwoman, are you finished? Yeah, Councilwoman Welch. Thank you, Mayor. I signed on in support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4071)|
| 1:08:03| of this resolution, and I remain supportive, but that doesn't mean that I don't also support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4083)|
| 1:08:09| making sure that we're paying our city employees generally, and I don't, I would assume that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4089)|
| 1:08:15| my fellow council members feel the same, that we need to make sure that we're paying all of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4095)|
| 1:08:21| our city employees at a fair and, you know, a market rate so that we have a competitive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4101)|
| 1:08:30| salary across the board in our city. So I don't know if Vicki Hatfield is here. This is not a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4110)|
| 1:08:36| civil service position, so I think that's the other thing to consider that, you know, we have a civil| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4116)|
| 1:08:40| service system, and the mayor is not, it's an elected position, so it's not part of the civil service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4120)|
| 1:08:50| It's not a civil service employee of the city, but I did reach out to Vicki Hatfield, who I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4130)|
| 1:08:55| believe is here, to ask her some questions about, kind of, how does this compare with how the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4135)|
| 1:09:00| does a salary survey? Are the cities that were considered part of the salary survey that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4140)|
| 1:09:06| is conducted, and they are, Nashville, Knox County, Chattanooga, Asheville, and Greenville, are all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4146)|
| 1:09:12| part of the salary survey, which is a very, this wasn't a salary survey. I mean, it was a survey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4152)|
| 1:09:18| but there's a whole scientific process behind doing a salary survey. It doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4158)|
| 1:09:25| generally apply to elected officials. Salary surveys are not typically used in elected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4165)|
| 1:09:30| offices. They're typically used in, you know, more routine employment situations, so it's sort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4170)|
| 1:09:39| of hard to compare a salary survey that's done for our general employees with a survey that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4179)|
| 1:09:45| was conducted for elected office. I do want to just note, however, in the response that I received| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4185)|
| 1:09:52| from Ms. Hatfield earlier today, that, you know, she did feel as though the data set that was used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4192)|
| 1:10:01| is probably somewhat, you know, comparable, just regionally, but again, she, I would not speak on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4201)|
| 1:10:10| her behalf to say that it meets the scientific standards for a salary survey, but the cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4210)|
| 1:10:15| seemed comparable, and the other question that I had for her is, based on the salary surveys that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4215)|
| 1:10:22| have been conducted, do we have any job classifications that are significantly undercompensated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4222)|
| 1:10:29| And I am sure that there could be dispute about this, but according to the salary surveys that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4229)|
| 1:10:37| have been conducted recently, she does not feel that we currently have any job classifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4237)|
| 1:10:42| that are currently significantly undercompensated. That does not mean that we don't need to continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4242)|
| 1:10:49| to make sure that we're looking at salaries, and particularly for those fields, such as our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4249)|
| 1:10:55| uniformed officers, that we have such a challenge in recruiting, you know, employees, so I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4255)|
| 1:11:02| like to make sure that in our budget conversation coming up, that that is part of the conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4262)|
| 1:11:07| but I don't think that precludes us from making sure that we're fairly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4267)|
| 1:11:12| and reasonably compensating a mayor for a gigantic job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4272)|
| 1:11:19| Thank you. Is your light still on? Okay. Thank you, Mayor. First off, thank you, Councilwoman Ryder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4279)|
| 1:11:26| and Councilwoman Welch for doing all that research, and, you know, the facts that you brought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4286)|
| 1:11:31| forward were very informative. I have so much respect for your position. This is not about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4291)|
| 1:11:37| how much work you do. I see that it's 24 hours. It's about me, and I'm not taking it personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4297)|
| 1:11:45| But moving forward, if there was a meritocracy where we actually earned what we were worth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4305)|
| 1:11:51| there would be no minimum wage, so it's not about that. This is about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4311)|
| 1:11:58| that this is a position that nobody has asked for a raise, and we're still giving it anyway, just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4318)|
| 1:12:04| because we want to. I don't know. That doesn't happen when you work at McDonald's. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4324)|
| 1:12:13| Thank you, Councilwoman Ryder. I just want to point out for the record, since we're discussing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4333)|
| 1:12:18| the salary survey for the employees and the continued process of looking at that, what we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4338)|
| 1:12:23| voted on last year was it was done annually. I'm not sure that the salary survey isn't done annually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4343)|
| 1:12:31| but the data to do the salary survey is collected every three years, because we were getting poor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4351)|
| 1:12:36| response, because cities didn't want to do all the work of giving us the information, so Ms. Hatfield| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4356)|
| 1:12:42| recommended, and I think that's fairly standard for a lot of other companies. They do a three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4362)|
| 1:12:48| to five year, and I believe we discussed that all, so I certainly would always be in favor of keeping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4368)|
| 1:12:54| that. I guess my hesitation in this is the arbitrary. I realize if you do the math, 1% is probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4374)|
| 1:13:09| low. It's certainly on the low end, and that would put you at 154. When you look at how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4389)|
| 1:13:15| arbitrarily it comes up, the number for an elected position is where I'm on the fence on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4395)|
| 1:13:25| Councilwoman Welk. Yes, thank you, Mayor. I just want to ask a question. What is the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4405)|
| 1:13:32| I know that there's been a 2.5% pay increase since 2015, and I didn't go back further than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4412)|
| 1:13:39| Since many, many years. I mean forever. Okay, so I appreciate Councilwoman Ryder's math,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4419)|
| 1:13:48| and your skills at math may be much better than mine. Oh, they're not that good. I'm a researcher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4428)|
| 1:13:53| I'm thinking that, so is the 2.5% increase standard? It's in the code. It's in the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4433)|
| 1:14:00| Oh, right. It's in the charter. Okay. It's in the code. So why are we looking at 1% rather than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4440)|
| 1:14:07| looking at the 2.5%? I just was doing, that was my math. Okay. I just was like, what if. So over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4447)|
| 1:14:12| the course of those years, employees received a 2.5% increase every year. Except for last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4452)|
| 1:14:20| was three. So. And other times there have been three. Under Mayor Haslam, there was a three or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4460)|
| 1:14:25| three and a half, one year, four. If somebody could do the math really quickly. I mean, I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4465)|
| 1:14:30| I think if you, well, I don't know how to do computational math that fast without a calculator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4470)|
| 1:14:36| I've already done one of my numbers, if you want me to tell you. Yes, and I'm speaking out of turn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4476)|
| 1:14:40| but I wanted to point out something. I'll be quiet until. Go ahead. So if you look from 2015,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4480)|
| 1:14:47| the, and you're matching the city employee raises with what the proposal would be today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4487)|
| 1:14:55| The current proposal is 14%. It would be 10.5% because it was 2.5 for most of that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4495)|
| 1:15:03| except for three last year. So that would be a salary of $157,462.50, which is 5,000 less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4503)|
| 1:15:13| Compound it, did you? I didn't compound it, no. It would be higher than that. You have to compound| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4513)|
| 1:15:18| it. You have to say, this year I multiply it by this. Do I need to take you to get a small savings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4518)|
| 1:15:22| account to learn how compounding works? I think. That's as good as the math you're going to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4522)|
| 1:15:28| from me. It would be greater than 160. That's the point of that, so. Ah, okay. All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4528)|
| 1:15:34| That's all we needed to know. Well, and then the reason I went back to 2003 is because of the years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4534)|
| 1:15:39| of stagnation where no one paid any attention to it because you had someone who wasn't collecting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4539)|
| 1:15:44| the salary. So it was an afterthought. I mean, none of us, well, some of us were on council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4544)|
| 1:15:49| but anyway. I don't know if I'm talking out of turn yet or not. I just wanted to point out when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4549)|
| 1:15:54| we discussed that the employees got 3%, that the police and fire recruits got a 10% increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4554)|
| 1:16:01| Police officers got 6%, which certainly has not solved all of our problems. This is all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4561)|
| 1:16:07| information from last May 2018, and I believe there was also a 2000, I believe there was a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4567)|
| 1:16:15| 10% increase for fire, but I don't want to, yeah. 3% to all fire with the exception of recruits got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4575)|
| 1:16:24| a 10%. 3% to all police with the exception of recruits, 10%, and police officers, 6%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4584)|
| 1:16:30| which we know has still not necessarily addressed the shortage of officers and number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4590)|
| 1:16:36| really the problem is the number of people applying to do the academy, and this was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4596)|
| 1:16:40| discussed yesterday at the mayor's budget hearings is how do we get more people to apply. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4600)|
| 1:16:45| all right, I accept your math. Okay, so we have a motion and a second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4605)|
| 1:16:54| and so we're going to do a roll call on this. Councilman Wallace? Yes. Councilman Welch? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4614)|
| 1:17:02| Councilman Kampen? Aye. Councilman McKenzie? Yes. Councilman Ryder? Yes. Councilman Roberto? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4622)|
| 1:17:13| Vice Mayor Saunders? Yes. Councilman Singh-Perez? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4633)|
| 1:17:20| All right, and Councilman Steer abstains. The motion passes 6-2 with one abstention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4640)|
| 1:17:26| All right, so that is the end of the ordinances. We have one person signed up for public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4646)|
| 1:17:33| and that is Robert Lee. Mr. Lee, are you here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4653)|
| 1:17:45| You're not, he wanted to know if he could sign up for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4665)|
| 1:17:48| That would be up to the council. First, is Mr. Lee here? Pretend like he's Mr. Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4668)|
| 1:17:53| Is Robert Lee here? Okay, he phoned in, so apparently he's not here, but sir,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4673)|
| 1:17:59| please come on down. Please state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4679)|
| 1:18:03| and you have up to five minutes. If you watch the timer above my head, we'll appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4683)|
| 1:18:08| Nowhere near that time, madam. Okay, thank you. My name is Kent Minow, and I live at 311 West| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4688)|

| 1:18:19| November from Los Angeles, California. Welcome. Thank you. Very kind of you. I'm addressing you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4699)|
| 1:18:26| tonight to ask you if you would form a plan. Now, I've noticed that many cities, counties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4706)|
| 1:18:32| and even states around the country have formed a commitment to move to 100% clean energy within a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4712)|
| 1:18:39| certain deadline. New Mexico has just passed a law to get to 100% by 2045. My former state of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190326?start=4719)|
