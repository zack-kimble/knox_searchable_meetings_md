| 1:49:59| You don't gain as much, but you don't lose as much in the bad years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6599)|
| 1:50:02| Is that the idea?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6602)|
| 1:50:03| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6603)|
| 1:50:04| Because if you're not, well, what the net effect initially is that it increases our liability that the city has to fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6604)|
| 1:50:14| In other words, when you reduce your assumptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6614)|
| 1:50:16| Are you teared up yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6616)|
| 1:50:19| The point is that's exactly the goal is to get that down to where we really can manage it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6619)|
| 1:50:25| without the volatility we're currently experiencing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6625)|
| 1:50:29| So you're saying as you lower the return assumption, you obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6629)|
| 1:50:32| the obligation to pay in money increases because you've got a shortfall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6632)|
| 1:50:36| Right now, that is the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6636)|
| 1:50:39| But long term, once you get the funding stabilized and the volatility stabilized, then you can work within a range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6639)|
| 1:50:46| Modulate the risk to a lower range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6646)|
| 1:50:49| So the pension board is looking very hard at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6649)|
| 1:50:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6653)|
| 1:50:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6654)|
| 1:50:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6655)|
| 1:50:56| I had a question on the risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6656)|
| 1:50:57| You've been saying that this plan is estimated at 50%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6657)|
| 1:51:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6662)|
| 1:51:03| How did you come up with that number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6663)|
| 1:51:06| A bit more than half of the liability is inactive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6666)|
| 1:51:09| And something like half of the liability, there are older people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6669)|
| 1:51:13| But that amount of risk is being taken on by the city, whereas all of the risk of the active liability, not all of the risk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6673)|
| 1:51:21| but a large percentage of the risk is being taken on by the active employees to the extent that their account balance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6681)|
| 1:51:28| ultimately provides that benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6688)|
| 1:51:30| I did not have a plan formula or a, you know, I can't give you an A plus B plus C that I came up with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6690)|
| 1:51:37| It's really an estimate just based on many different factors that go into the overall risk model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6697)|
| 1:51:43| But it's true that it seems like this plan, the real risk is with the retirees, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6703)|
| 1:51:49| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6709)|
| 1:51:50| So the real risk is going to come sort of like the situation we're in now when we have more retirees than current employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6710)|
| 1:51:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6716)|
| 1:51:58| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6718)|
| 1:51:59| For this new plan, it would take quite a long time for that to happen since we're just adopting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6719)|
| 1:52:05| But that's where the real risk is for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6725)|
| 1:52:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6727)|
| 1:52:08| Not the $40,000 floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6728)|
| 1:52:10| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6730)|
| 1:52:13| The thing is you have more inactive people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6733)|
| 1:52:19| Further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6739)|
| 1:52:20| Was that as you have more inactive or the other word for that is retired people than active workers, that's when the risk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6740)|
| 1:52:27| increases, is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6747)|
| 1:52:29| Well, what happens is, I mean, to me, you know, I'm not in favor of this plan because I think we could put another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6749)|
| 1:52:36| council right in the same position we're in today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6756)|
| 1:52:39| And the way that happens is the employee's benefits are based on the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6759)|
| 1:52:45| So if they are employed for 20 or 30 years and there's strong market growth through those years, their benefit goes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6765)|
| 1:52:53| It's not defined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6773)|
| 1:52:54| It goes up with the market because they'll have an account and it's going to go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6774)|
| 1:52:58| And once they retire, if you get a large group of retirees when the market's up, then their monthly benefit is set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6778)|
| 1:53:07| And I spend a lot of time looking at this plan and really feel very uncomfortable with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6787)|
| 1:53:12| But then it's set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6792)|
| 1:53:13| And, of course, this wouldn't happen for decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6793)|
| 1:53:15| I mean, it's going to take 10 years for one person to vest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6795)|
| 1:53:17| And then before they retire, I mean, probably all of us, including me, will be long gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6797)|
| 1:53:22| But what could happen is you could have a large number of employees retire in a strong market, say the 1920s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6802)|
| 1:53:31| Then you'd have the 1930s where there's a big market downturn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6811)|
| 1:53:34| Well, those employees, their benefits are set when the market is high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6814)|
| 1:53:38| So that's where the real risk is in this plan, the $40,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6818)|
| 1:53:42| I think we've, you know, established that that's a floor and there's some risk there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6822)|
| 1:53:46| But the real risk is with the retirees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6826)|
| 1:53:49| So, you know, I just feel uncomfortable, you know, putting a future counsel in this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6829)|
| 1:53:55| And maybe it would never happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6835)|
| 1:53:57| And maybe, you know, you can do things to mitigate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6837)|
| 1:53:59| But I think that risk is there because the benefit is not defined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6839)|
| 1:54:04| I mean, it can go up as high as the market goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6844)|
| 1:54:06| And then if the market goes down or there's a couple decades of slow growth, you're going to have serious,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6846)|
| 1:54:12| serious unfunded liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6852)|
| 1:54:14| And to me, you know, listening to all this, I just think, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6854)|
| 1:54:20| we're drinking the Kool-Aid mix of predictions, estimations, and assumptions that got us into this mess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6860)|
| 1:54:29| We're adopting a plan based on 6.5 percent, but our 10-year return is 5.2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6869)|
| 1:54:36| The other issue I wanted to bring up and, you know, why I'm against this plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6876)|
| 1:54:40| and one of my concerns about it is it's supposed to be a benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6880)|
| 1:54:43| This is supposed to attract people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6883)|
| 1:54:47| It's so complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6887)|
| 1:54:48| Mr. Stare, I'm sorry to interrupt you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6888)|
| 1:54:50| No, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6890)|
| 1:54:51| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6891)|
| 1:54:52| I'm making a point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6892)|
| 1:54:54| It's so complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6894)|
| 1:54:56| I just don't know how we're going to explain it to new employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6896)|
| 1:54:58| I've been trying to explain it to people as I talk to you, and it's so complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6898)|
| 1:55:02| I mean, we're talking to a new employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6902)|
| 1:55:04| We want to say we've got this benefit, and hopefully they understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6904)|
| 1:55:08| I mean, when you start talking about annuities and this floor and all these different factors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6908)|
| 1:55:12| I just don't know if it's that much of a benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6912)|
| 1:55:15| And especially a lot of employees these days, I mean, the market chains are not just career employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6915)|
| 1:55:22| The younger generation moves around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6922)|
| 1:55:24| So if they're looking at a benefit that they don't even --.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6924)|
| 1:55:28| It's not portable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6928)|
| 1:55:29| It's not portable, and they're not going to have access to it unless they stay 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6929)|
| 1:55:34| I mean, that's a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6934)|
| 1:55:36| I mean, to have no retirement benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6936)|
| 1:55:38| And if you think about sort of the eight-year cycles where people come in for four and eight years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6938)|
| 1:55:43| none of those people would have access to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6943)|
| 1:55:45| And maybe that's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6945)|
| 1:55:47| But to me, it just isn't really a benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6947)|
| 1:55:51| And the other thing is, you know, as soon as they leave, the current system, they have incentive to stay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6951)|
| 1:55:56| because every year they work, they get 2 percent more of their salary once they retire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6956)|
| 1:56:00| Well, now this system, it's not really set to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6960)|
| 1:56:03| So there's not really that great of an incentive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6963)|
| 1:56:05| There's not a great incentive to stay either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6965)|
| 1:56:07| So to me, it's a very expensive plan, and I'm just not sure it's worth the benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6967)|
| 1:56:14| You know, I think you've got your floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6974)|
| 1:56:15| It's not --.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6975)|
| 1:56:16| If the market does really, really well, I don't see it going below 8 and 10 percent, even though that could happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6976)|
| 1:56:22| So that's where I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6982)|
| 1:56:26| And one question I would have for council and the administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6986)|
| 1:56:29| and the employee groups is would we want to consider to make this optional?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6989)|
| 1:56:36| The administration would not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6996)|
| 1:56:38| An optional retirement plan is not, I think, viable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=6998)|
| 1:56:43| We'll recognize Mr. Pennington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7003)|
| 1:56:45| Yeah, I was just going to suggest, I know we've got two more items on the list of levers to go over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7005)|
| 1:56:50| I know it's getting late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7010)|
| 1:56:51| We've been here a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7011)|
| 1:56:52| If the council's desire is to revisit the issue of whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7012)|
| 1:56:55| or not you should support a hybrid or D.C. plan, then, of course, that's your pleasure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7015)|
| 1:56:59| But I was hoping to actually finish these points before we get out of here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7019)|
| 1:57:02| Yes, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7022)|
| 1:57:05| And I think we've discussed this one thoroughly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7025)|
| 1:57:09| Mr. Wilson, call the roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7029)|
| 1:57:12| Well, let's talk about what we're voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7032)|
| 1:57:14| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7034)|
| 1:57:15| Do you want me to restate the recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7035)|
| 1:57:16| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7036)|
| 1:57:17| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7037)|
| 1:57:18| The recommendation is on the cost of living that it be based on the consumer price index, not less than zero percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7038)|
| 1:57:26| and that a full COLA would be provided if the plan, the new plan bucket of assets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7046)|
| 1:57:32| if that new bucket stays at least 95% funded, if it's 80% or actually less than 80%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7052)|
| 1:57:40| then you get a fourth of the regular COLA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7060)|
| 1:57:42| So if it would have been 2%, now you only get a one-half percent COLA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7062)|
| 1:57:46| And if it's between 80% and 85%, then you get half of whatever the regular COLA would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7066)|
| 1:57:51| That's the recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7071)|
| 1:57:53| When do you get zero?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7073)|
| 1:57:56| If the CPI is zero or less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7076)|
| 1:57:59| Not if it's grossly underfunded?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7079)|
| 1:58:03| Under this recommendation, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7083)|
| 1:58:05| In other words, you don't have another category that if it's below 60%, then there's no COLA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7085)|
| 1:58:11| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7091)|
| 1:58:12| Is there any reason why you couldn't have some other lever in there that in your index?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7092)|
| 1:58:17| The presumption, my presumption, perhaps it's not right or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7097)|
| 1:58:21| is that under the future pension boards, assets would be invested relatively more conservatively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7101)|
| 1:58:26| It's much more likely the funding would stay between 90% and 110%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7106)|
| 1:58:30| If the council desired to put a 60% lever in there to say if the plan gets less than 60%, there's no COLA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7110)|
| 1:58:38| I think is a practical matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7118)|
| 1:58:40| That would be, you know, if that happens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7120)|
| 1:58:42| then people haven't been following a reasonable investment policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7122)|
| 1:58:50| Why not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7130)|
| 1:58:51| I mean, I'm fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7131)|
| 1:58:53| I mean, if it's zero to 3% and we never have a zero, it doesn't make any sense to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7133)|
| 1:58:56| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7136)|
| 1:58:57| If it's underfunded by that much, they wouldn't get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7137)|
| 1:58:59| I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7139)|
| 1:59:00| I mean, the CPI was negative a couple of years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7140)|
| 1:59:02| So, I mean, it could be zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7142)|
| 1:59:04| But, yeah, if you want to, you know, I'd be happy to revise the recommendation and say if it's less than 60%, then you get zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7144)|
| 1:59:09| Fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7149)|
| 1:59:10| I don't have any problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7150)|
| 1:59:11| I'm fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7151)|
| 1:59:12| I think that's, I like the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7152)|
| 1:59:15| That's where we are now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7155)|
| 1:59:16| I mean, and that's what we're trying to prevent is to try to prevent that as much as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7156)|
| 1:59:21| Employees are, you know, you invest in employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7161)|
| 1:59:24| I mean, that's the whole deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7164)|
| 1:59:25| You're trying to keep them and retain them and grow them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7165)|
| 1:59:27| And, I mean, this is the value of the city is employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7167)|
| 1:59:30| That's what you've got to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7170)|
| 1:59:31| That's what they're about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7171)|
| 1:59:32| We have 1,500 of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7172)|
| 1:59:33| It's our asset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7173)|
| 1:59:35| And that's a big part of your budget and it needs to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7175)|
| 1:59:39| I mean, that's what services, you're here for services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7179)|
| 1:59:41| I think, I like the amendment where if it's, if we're less than 60% funded, we don't, there is no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7181)|
| 1:59:47| even if the CPI increase was three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7187)|
| 1:59:51| I like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7191)|
| 1:59:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7194)|
| 1:59:56| You're presenting that as the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7196)|
| 1:59:57| I present that as the Wallace amendment, as you all have determined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7197)|
| 2:00:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7201)|
| 2:00:02| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7202)|
| 2:00:03| Wallace plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7203)|
| 2:00:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7204)|
| 2:00:05| That's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7205)|
| 2:00:06| You get a house with this when you retire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7206)|
| 2:00:07| If you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7207)|
| 2:00:08| 20% you take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7208)|
| 2:00:09| You'll call the roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7209)|
| 2:00:10| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7210)|
| 2:00:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7212)|
| 2:00:15| Councilman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7215)|
| 2:00:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7216)|
| 2:00:18| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7218)|
| 2:00:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7219)|
| 2:00:20| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7220)|
| 2:00:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7221)|
| 2:00:23| Councilman Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7223)|
| 2:00:24| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7224)|
| 2:00:25| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7225)|
| 2:00:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7226)|
| 2:00:28| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7228)|
| 2:00:29| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7229)|
| 2:00:31| Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7231)|
| 2:00:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7232)|
| 2:00:34| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7234)|
| 2:00:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7235)|
| 2:00:39| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7239)|
| 2:00:40| The last item on the agenda is the in-line of duty disability benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7240)|
| 2:00:44| The in-line of duty disability benefit in the general government essentially says whatever benefit you have earned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7244)|
| 2:00:51| to date, your accrued benefit, if you become in-line of duty disabled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7251)|
| 2:00:55| you can get that amount as a monthly benefit the rest of your life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7255)|
| 2:00:59| That's not a particularly generous in-line of duty benefit, but that's what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7259)|
| 2:01:03| I've recommended using the same thing in the new plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7263)|
| 2:01:08| In the fire and police plan, if you become in-line of duty disabled, you get 50 percent of pay as a lifetime benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7268)|
| 2:01:15| for the rest of your life, regardless of what age you were when you became disabled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7275)|
| 2:01:19| That is next to the basic retirement formula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7279)|
| 2:01:23| That's the most expensive benefit in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7283)|
| 2:01:28| If part of the desire is to reduce the total cost of the plan, this is one place that costs could be reduced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7288)|
| 2:01:36| Part of the issue is in the formula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7296)|
| 2:01:39| Part of it is in determining what does in-line of duty disability mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7299)|
| 2:01:44| If the council desired to leave the same basic definition of in-line of duty disability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7304)|
| 2:01:50| but wanted to modestly reduce the cost, you could award a 50 percent of pay benefit, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7310)|
| 2:01:57| for a member that was in-line of duty and also Social Security disabled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7317)|
| 2:02:02| which most people consider to be a higher criteria of disability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7322)|
| 2:02:07| Whereas if they were not Social Security disabled, but determined still to be in-line of duty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7327)|
| 2:02:15| you might provide somewhat relatively lower, perhaps a 30 percent of pay benefit rather than 50 percent of pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7335)|
| 2:02:22| Now, you know, you don't have to pay within the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7342)|
| 2:02:26| This is something that some plans carve out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7346)|
| 2:02:29| They hire an outside consultant and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7349)|
| 2:02:32| you're going to be responsible for determining what is in-line of duty and what's not based on these criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7352)|
| 2:02:37| And it keeps that decision from being made where, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7357)|
| 2:02:42| internal forces might affect the outcome of those decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7362)|
| 2:02:48| You could leave the provisions exactly the way they are under the current plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7368)|
| 2:02:52| or you could do something different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7372)|
| 2:02:54| But this is a significant cost issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7374)|
| 2:02:56| And I felt if we were reviewing all the provisions in the plan that it would be very appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7376)|
| 2:03:02| to consider that provision and put it before you for your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7382)|
| 2:03:08| Councilman Delva.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7388)|
| 2:03:10| Yeah, I'm trying to understand this because obviously police and fire put their lives at risk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7390)|
| 2:03:17| and their bodies at risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7397)|
| 2:03:18| And obviously disability is a legitimate concern, and we have to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7398)|
| 2:03:24| I didn't understand the difference between the Social Security disability versus some other kind of disability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7404)|
| 2:03:32| and how you adjust that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7412)|
| 2:03:33| I mean, is one the inability to perform your specific profession but not work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7413)|
| 2:03:39| I mean, what are you saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7419)|
| 2:03:41| The Social Security, in order to be eligible for a Social Security disability benefit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7421)|
| 2:03:47| you have to apply to the Social Security Administration, meet certain relatively strict criteria,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7427)|
| 2:03:52| and then if you are deemed to be disabled, based on that criteria,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7432)|
| 2:03:56| you would get a disability benefit from the Social Security Administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7436)|
| 2:04:01| Regardless of age, basically?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7441)|
| 2:04:02| Regardless of age, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7442)|
| 2:04:03| And then under the proposal, if you were deemed to meet those more strict criteria,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7443)|
| 2:04:10| then you would be deemed also to get the 50 percent of pay rather than the 30 percent of pay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7450)|
| 2:04:15| in which case, even though you're considered in line of duty disabled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7455)|
| 2:04:19| you still may be able to perform another job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7459)|
| 2:04:21| You just may not be able to perform the job that you were currently in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7461)|
| 2:04:24| It might be a desk guy or something after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7464)|
| 2:04:26| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7466)|
| 2:04:29| So you'd have two tiers, basically?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7469)|
| 2:04:31| Yeah, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7471)|
| 2:04:32| In terms of the current in line of duty criteria, Mr. Cherry is here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7472)|
| 2:04:38| and he can talk to that more specifically if you're interested in hearing more details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7478)|
| 2:04:42| I do not understand all the criteria that goes into it at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7482)|
| 2:04:47| And your recommendation is what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7487)|
| 2:04:48| The two tier or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7488)|
| 2:04:49| Yes, that's my current recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7489)|
| 2:04:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7490)|
| 2:04:53| You said there's a significant cost for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7493)|
| 2:04:55| So what are we talking about in terms of cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7495)|
| 2:04:58| If you took the disability benefit out of the plan on the fire and police expected cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7498)|
| 2:05:05| it might reduce the total cost by close to 2 percent of pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7505)|
| 2:05:11| So the long-term cost for the fire and police, maybe rather than being 9.5 percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7511)|
| 2:05:16| might be between 7.5 and 8 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7516)|
| 2:05:19| So it's a relatively significant portion of the cost within the benefit structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7519)|
| 2:05:30| If I could, if you're charging into a building after the bad guy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7530)|
| 2:05:34| you don't got to be thinking 50 percent, you know, disability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7534)|
| 2:05:38| I mean, you got to go do your job, and you agree to take certain risks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7538)|
| 2:05:42| And I think it's important for the city in those situations where we have a disabled worker to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7542)|
| 2:05:48| certainly to take care of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7548)|
| 2:05:50| They give their health and their life, you know, in that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7550)|
| 2:05:55| So I don't know how you would carve it completely out of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7555)|
| 2:05:59| That doesn't make any sense to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7559)|
| 2:06:00| I guess I understand your explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7560)|
| 2:06:02| On the two tier, you would have a guy who's basically lost his police career entirely because he's really badly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7562)|
| 2:06:09| injured or fire career or even some other career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7569)|
| 2:06:12| But in another case, he might have had a disability where he can't be a motorcycle cop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7572)|
| 2:06:17| he could be a, you know, forensic cop in an office or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7577)|
| 2:06:22| That's what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7582)|
| 2:06:23| There's a situation where you're still employable in your line of work, but it might be defined slightly differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7583)|
| 2:06:29| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7589)|
| 2:06:30| And you might charge, you know, Mr. Cherry, Mr. Gilbert,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7590)|
| 2:06:34| to come up with some distinctions that were appropriate to meet those criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7594)|
| 2:06:39| And in terms of figuring costs, you looked at the 50-30 for fire, police,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7599)|
| 2:06:45| and what did you use for the general government?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7605)|
| 2:06:48| Actually, for general government and fire and police,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7608)|
| 2:06:50| I assume that the disability benefit would be an immediate payment of whatever the value of their account balance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7610)|
| 2:06:56| or their defined benefit, monthly benefit was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7616)|
| 2:06:59| So the 30-50 or the current provisions, either one, would increase the projections that I previously provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7619)|
| 2:07:08| Would increase the projections you provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7628)|
| 2:07:10| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7630)|
| 2:07:11| The projections I provided did not reflect the current disability benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7631)|
| 2:07:17| And so when you graph those lines in terms of what the cost was, that was not in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7637)|
| 2:07:22| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7642)|
| 2:07:23| And you would bump it up 2%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7643)|
| 2:07:24| Or would you say no, more than that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7644)|
| 2:07:25| Yeah, one and a half, 2% if you did the current provisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7645)|
| 2:07:28| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7648)|
| 2:07:29| Well, even though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7649)|
| 2:07:30| Actually, the one and a half, 2% is just one and a half, 2% of payroll for fire and police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7650)|
| 2:07:34| So the total cost might be 1% of payroll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7654)|
| 2:07:37| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7657)|
| 2:07:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7658)|
| 2:07:39| So basically, if you had a defined contribution plan, you'd have to have some kind of disability insurance that would protect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7659)|
| 2:07:44| people who are hurt in the line of duty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7664)|
| 2:07:47| I mean, that would be fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7667)|
| 2:07:48| Yes, yes, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7668)|
| 2:07:49| Either plan is going to have that cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7669)|
| 2:07:52| Right, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7672)|
| 2:07:53| When you said carve it out, what did you mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7673)|
| 2:07:54| Just that, insure it separately?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7674)|
| 2:07:56| Yes, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7676)|
| 2:07:57| You could, I mean, you could go to an insurance company and buy a disability policy for the employees that provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7677)|
| 2:08:04| a similar benefit and just pay premiums where it was, everything was independent of the pension plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7684)|
| 2:08:11| You just sold that risk to someone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7691)|
| 2:08:13| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7693)|
| 2:08:16| So it doesn't have to be part of the pension plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7696)|
| 2:08:19| It doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7699)|
| 2:08:20| Many times it is because many plans consider it less expensive to self-insure than to go out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7700)|
| 2:08:26| and pay premiums to an insurance company where you're paying expense ratios and so forth and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7706)|
| 2:08:32| But, yeah, I mean, if a group did not want to have the responsibility of determining who's disabled and who's not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7712)|
| 2:08:41| you could just say, look, we're having a disability policy and the insurance company sets these criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7721)|
| 2:08:46| and they determine if you meet the criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7726)|
| 2:08:49| And even though it might be more expensive, the benefit of not having to make those individual determinations in some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7729)|
| 2:08:58| cases might be desirable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7738)|
| 2:09:03| Question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7743)|
| 2:09:04| Now, does this actually reduce from the current plan what you're recommending now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7744)|
| 2:09:11| Does it actually reduce what a person would receive in terms of their disability?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7751)|
| 2:09:16| Yes, for two reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7756)|
| 2:09:18| On the general government side, the accrued benefit under the new plan would be relatively smaller than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7758)|
| 2:09:23| under the current plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7763)|
| 2:09:25| And since that's the basis for the disability benefit, you know, the general government benefit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7765)|
| 2:09:30| even though it's the same basic formula, would still be relatively smaller just because the overall benefit structure is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7770)|
| 2:09:36| relatively smaller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7776)|
| 2:09:38| But on the fire and police side, if you stick with the current 50 percent of pay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7778)|
| 2:09:44| that's not tied to the account balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7784)|
| 2:09:46| That's not tied to the $40,000 minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7786)|
| 2:09:49| That's not tied to anything else in the hybrid plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7789)|
| 2:09:52| It's just sort of, okay, regardless of anything else we've decided, we're also going to provide a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7792)|
| 2:09:58| if you stick with the current provisions, a 50 percent of pay disability benefit for the fire and police members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7798)|
| 2:10:06| Well, I'm just not too comfortable with reducing any kind of disability benefits for fire and police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7806)|
| 2:10:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7812)|
| 2:10:13| I mean, that, you know, if it's the council's desire to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7813)|
| 2:10:15| I just wanted to bring it to your attention that that was a significant cost item within the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7815)|
| 2:10:20| I didn't want that to come back and be a surprise later on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7820)|
| 2:10:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7823)|
| 2:10:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7824)|
| 2:10:25| Councilman Gregg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7825)|
| 2:10:26| Thank you for bringing that up, because I kind of agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7826)|
| 2:10:28| But what is it that we have right now for the fire and police and general service?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7828)|
| 2:10:33| Fifty percent of pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7833)|
| 2:10:34| Fifty percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7834)|
| 2:10:35| Fifty percent of pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7835)|
| 2:10:36| Or as a lifetime benefit upon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7836)|
| 2:10:39| That's for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7839)|
| 2:10:41| In fire and police, not general government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7841)|
| 2:10:43| And what do we have for general government?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7843)|
| 2:10:44| The value of their monthly accrued benefit payable as a life annuity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7844)|
| 2:10:48| So if you've worked for 15 years and your monthly deferred benefit was $2,000 a year starting at 62,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7848)|
| 2:10:55| then you get that amount immediately, I believe, after 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7855)|
| 2:11:00| You have to have 15 years in the general government to get that immediate life annuity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7860)|
| 2:11:04| Otherwise, it's just a deferred benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7864)|
| 2:11:06| And with fire and police, who determines that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7866)|
| 2:11:10| That's subject to the pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7870)|
| 2:11:12| Yeah, subject to the pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7872)|
| 2:11:14| As far as determining whether a disability is given to someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7874)|
| 2:11:16| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7876)|
| 2:11:25| Dr. Lyons, I mean, this is a reduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7885)|
| 2:11:28| I mean, obviously you all have discussed this with all the employee groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7888)|
| 2:11:34| It could be for one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7894)|
| 2:11:36| We have not discussed this particular item with the employee groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7896)|
| 2:11:41| This is something that Alan felt like he should have before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7901)|
| 2:11:45| I am not opposed and I don't want to go on record as being opposed to the current provisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7905)|
| 2:11:49| I just want to go on record as saying this is a significant cost benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7909)|
| 2:11:54| and I just wanted everybody to be fully aware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7914)|
| 2:11:56| I think it's a real financial lever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7916)|
| 2:11:58| Right, right, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7918)|
| 2:12:00| I mean, if pulling a lever and affecting long-term costs is an issue, then this is a significant lever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7920)|
| 2:12:06| Now, if it's the desire of everybody to leave it alone, leave it where it is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7926)|
| 2:12:11| I have no objection to that whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7931)|
| 2:12:14| So I just wanted to be clear that I was just bringing it up as a significant cost component within the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7934)|
| 2:12:19| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7939)|
| 2:12:21| You gave a percentage about the costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7941)|
| 2:12:24| Can you give us some whole dollars, what it would be now, if that's not too difficult?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7944)|
| 2:12:33| Yeah, the current payroll is around $65 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7953)|
| 2:12:37| So if we were talking about applying these benefits to the current plan, we're not, okay, we're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7957)|
| 2:12:43| But if we were, you know, 10% of payroll, $6 million, 1% of payroll, $600,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7963)|
| 2:12:50| So you're talking $600,000 to $1 million a year, long ongoing additional costs for, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7970)|
| 2:13:00| and these are very round numbers, like I said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7980)|
| 2:13:03| If this is something that you want me to go back and put the pen and paper to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7983)|
| 2:13:08| and actually run more numbers, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7988)|
| 2:13:11| No, you don't have to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7991)|
| 2:13:12| I'm just, thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7992)|
| 2:13:14| You've got the ballpark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7994)|
| 2:13:15| Yeah, that would be a ballpark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7995)|
| 2:13:17| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7997)|
| 2:13:18| So I guess the question that could, for a million or a million and a half dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=7998)|
| 2:13:23| could you go out and secure insurance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8003)|
| 2:13:26| That's really the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8006)|
| 2:13:27| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8007)|
| 2:13:28| And I would not want you to go out and say, well, can I secure insurance for a million and a half dollars?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8008)|
| 2:13:31| Because the difference in the million, million and a half is the basic disability provision of just get your accrued benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8011)|
| 2:13:38| So there's still a disability benefit there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8018)|
| 2:13:40| But then the increase to go to a 50% of pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8020)|
| 2:13:43| So the total cost of all that disability benefit might be relatively more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8023)|
| 2:13:48| But if you were going to really consider going out to an insurance company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8028)|
| 2:13:52| I would really need to go back and put the pen to the paper and give you some more detailed numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8032)|
| 2:13:58| I'll go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8038)|
| 2:13:59| Does this have to be in the plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8039)|
| 2:14:01| Can you set it outside?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8041)|
| 2:14:02| That's really my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8042)|
| 2:14:04| Can you set it outside?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8044)|
| 2:14:05| Are we all comfortable doing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8045)|
| 2:14:09| What do you think, Bill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8049)|
| 2:14:10| I mean, are you all comfortable setting it outside the plan and not bound into the plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8050)|
| 2:14:15| I believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8055)|
| 2:14:16| And I want to clarify, this is something, you know, the administration is not necessarily supporting what Allen's brought forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8056)|
| 2:14:22| He, you know, he is not just working for us here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8062)|
| 2:14:24| He's working with you, providing you this more information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8064)|
| 2:14:26| So, you know, we're okay with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8066)|
| 2:14:28| I'm on my own now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8068)|
| 2:14:31| How do you like it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8071)|
| 2:14:33| We're going to show you how it feels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8073)|
| 2:14:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8075)|
| 2:14:36| Let me bring this back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8076)|
| 2:14:37| Let me reel this back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8077)|
| 2:14:38| Councilman Starr, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8078)|
| 2:14:39| Well, that was going to be one of my questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8079)|
| 2:14:40| Does the administration have an opinion on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8080)|
| 2:14:43| And then number two, and I probably should know the answer to this, what do we do for comp?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8083)|
| 2:14:47| Do we self-insure up to a certain amount?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8087)|
| 2:14:53| Yeah, we do self-insure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8093)|
| 2:14:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8094)|
| 2:14:56| And does the administration have a position on this issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8096)|
| 2:15:00| I mean, right now, I think our, you know, well, we're still talking about the disability issue right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8100)|
| 2:15:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8105)|
| 2:15:06| I think our, we prefer it, I think, to stay in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8106)|
| 2:15:09| And pretty much we were assuming it would stay as it was right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8109)|
| 2:15:14| I couldn't say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8114)|
| 2:15:15| We haven't looked at the various alternatives to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8115)|
| 2:15:19| Real quick, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8119)|
| 2:15:20| Is it possible for someone in your office to explore the cost of private insurance just as a matter of comparison or anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8120)|
| 2:15:28| In other words?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8128)|
| 2:15:29| I mean, the short answer is it's going to cost, generally speaking, relatively more outside the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8129)|
| 2:15:35| The reason people go outside the plan is not to save money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8135)|
| 2:15:39| The reason they go outside the plan is so they don't have to make the determination of who's disabled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8139)|
| 2:15:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8143)|
| 2:15:44| So if the significant issue is making the determination, then that may make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8144)|
| 2:15:49| If the issue is more cost, then it probably makes more sense to leave it in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8149)|
| 2:15:53| Who makes the determination now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8153)|
| 2:15:55| Is Mr. Cherry here or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8155)|
| 2:15:56| Pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8156)|
| 2:15:57| Pension board decides if someone is permanently disabled?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8157)|
| 2:16:00| Is that what you decide as opposed to just disabled for a period of time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8160)|
| 2:16:04| Well, I think Mr. Cherry could address this, but that's one of the issues if you go to pension board meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8164)|
| 2:16:07| and look at the agenda, that a lot of it is that determination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8167)|
| 2:16:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8172)|
| 2:16:13| So the question here is do we want to adopt this new plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8173)|
| 2:16:17| And I'm going to assume that if it was voted down, then that defaults back to what is currently in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8177)|
| 2:16:29| You mean leave what is currently in the existing plan in the new plan, put that in the new plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8189)|
| 2:16:35| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8195)|
| 2:16:36| Is that what you mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8196)|
| 2:16:37| Fifty percent of pay in one case and the accumulated benefit approach in the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8197)|
| 2:16:42| If I could make one other comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8202)|
| 2:16:45| My recommendation was a recommendation on the presumption that there was a desire for cost savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8205)|
| 2:16:50| I've heard more than one comment to say that there's not a desire to mess with that benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8210)|
| 2:16:57| So, you know, I don't have any objection to using the current benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8217)|
| 2:17:04| And if it's the desire of the council to vote on that up or down, then, you know, I don't want to hamper that effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8224)|
| 2:17:11| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8231)|
| 2:17:12| Well, as I say, if this was to not be successful, then the default is the current plan would be entered into the new plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8232)|
| 2:17:21| Councilman Gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8241)|
| 2:17:22| I was just going to say I think the most important thing is that we be sure that we take care of our disabled employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8242)|
| 2:17:27| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8247)|
| 2:17:28| However this works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8248)|
| 2:17:30| That's a must.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8250)|
| 2:17:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8251)|
| 2:17:32| Are we comfortable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8252)|
| 2:17:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8254)|
| 2:17:35| Ms. Wilson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8255)|
| 2:17:36| Councilman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8256)|
| 2:17:37| Wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8257)|
| 2:17:38| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8258)|
| 2:17:39| What are we voting on here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8259)|
| 2:17:40| I want to be real clear which way I'm going to go on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8260)|
| 2:17:44| Exactly what is the question on which we are voting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8264)|
| 2:17:47| Okay, the recommendation that has been brought forth by Mr. Pennington as opposed to the current plan that we have in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8267)|
| 2:18:00| And if you want him to paraphrase or just summarize, well, I mean, it's just the recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8280)|
| 2:18:07| So if we accept his recommendation, we would vote yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8287)|
| 2:18:10| If we reject his recommendation, we will vote no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8290)|
| 2:18:13| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8293)|
| 2:18:14| I will vote no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8294)|
| 2:18:17| Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8297)|
| 2:18:18| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8298)|
| 2:18:20| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8300)|
| 2:18:21| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8301)|
| 2:18:23| Councilman Steyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8303)|
| 2:18:25| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8305)|
| 2:18:27| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8307)|
| 2:18:28| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8308)|
| 2:18:29| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8309)|
| 2:18:30| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8310)|
| 2:18:32| Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8312)|
| 2:18:33| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8313)|
| 2:18:34| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8314)|
| 2:18:36| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8316)|
| 2:18:37| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8317)|
| 2:18:38| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8318)|
| 2:18:40| Praise the Lord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8320)|
| 2:18:49| I believe that's the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8329)|
| 2:18:50| That is the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8330)|
| 2:18:51| Congratulations and thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8331)|
| 2:18:57| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8337)|
| 2:19:00| So are we too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8340)|
| 2:19:01| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8341)|
| 2:19:02| So at this point, we can have Mr. Gilbert and Bill Mason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8342)|
| 2:19:08| who is the attorney helping us begin to prepare all of these items in this list to make them ballot ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8348)|
| 2:19:14| Is that our understanding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8354)|
| 2:19:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8357)|
| 2:19:19| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8359)|
| 2:19:21| I wonder if it would be appropriate to revisit the now amended DBDC max lever plan or whatever we call it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8361)|
| 2:19:31| and compare it to the defined contribution plan and see if we're still here on this plan as we have defined it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8371)|
| 2:19:37| Half of the comments made during the meeting were, well, I'm voting on this, but I'm not in favor of it kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8377)|
| 2:19:42| And, you know, I don't know if we know where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8382)|
| 2:19:44| But I think we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8384)|
| 2:19:45| But I don't know if we know where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8385)|
| 2:19:47| I wonder if we should just be sure that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8387)|
| 2:19:49| Before you take that issue, could I take two minutes and run down what I believe everybody accepted and let you confirm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8389)|
| 2:19:56| Summarize what you think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8396)|
| 2:19:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8397)|
| 2:19:58| Make sure that we're all on the same page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8398)|
| 2:19:59| I just want to make sure that I heard what I think I heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8399)|
| 2:20:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8404)|
| 2:20:05| Item number one, $40,000 break point was approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8405)|
| 2:20:10| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8410)|
| 2:20:11| Item number two, the indexing was approved with the additional amendment that it should not increase beyond the average pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8411)|
| 2:20:20| of the general government fire and police employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8420)|
| 2:20:23| Item three, interest crediting rate that such accounts shall be credited with whatever rate is earned on the fund was approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8423)|
| 2:20:32| Retirement age, 63 with 10 years of service for the general government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8432)|
| 2:20:38| 56 with 25 years of service for the fire and police,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8438)|
| 2:20:43| with fire and police retirement age also not to be later than 62 and 10 years of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8443)|
| 2:20:52| Item five, contribution credits, 6% employee contribution, 8% general government, 10% fire and police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8452)|
| 2:21:02| Cost of living, we just went through that, so I won't restate that, but the recommendation was accepted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8462)|
| 2:21:09| The partial lump sum such that the lump sum may be offered up to 10% was accepted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8469)|
| 2:21:17| End line of duty was rejected in favor of the current provision staying as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8477)|
| 2:21:23| Early retirement was accepted as is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8483)|
| 2:21:28| Termination prior to normal retirement was accepted as is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8488)|
| 2:21:32| Optional forms, normal retirement, I believe the rest of the items were accepted as they were recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8492)|
| 2:21:39| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8499)|
| 2:21:41| Everybody okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8501)|
| 2:21:42| Any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8502)|
| 2:21:43| On the cola, below 60% funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8503)|
| 2:21:53| That's right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8513)|
| 2:21:54| Okay, you got that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8514)|
| 2:21:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8518)|
| 2:22:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8520)|
| 2:22:01| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8521)|
| 2:22:02| You've just been a wealth of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8522)|
| 2:22:05| You've had a tough job, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8525)|
| 2:22:07| No, truly it's been a pleasure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8527)|
| 2:22:09| and I really appreciate the opportunity to work with the council as a whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8529)|
| 2:22:13| and with the individual council members that I've had the opportunity to work with as well as the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8533)|
| 2:22:17| So it truly has been interesting, challenging, but it really has been very satisfying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8537)|
| 2:22:24| and I appreciate the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8544)|
| 2:22:28| Are we going to do what Mr. Delvaux recommended?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8548)|
| 2:22:35| Well, you know, I guess if that's the will of the council, I really feel like that we've got to where we need to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8555)|
| 2:22:44| I mean, I don't know what the rest of the council feels like, but I'll acknowledge some lights here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8564)|
| 2:22:52| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8572)|
| 2:22:53| I'm not in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8573)|
| 2:22:54| I think we're where we should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8574)|
| 2:22:55| Just me personally, I'm comfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8575)|
| 2:22:57| I think we should move forward with all this hard work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8577)|
| 2:23:00| I mean, we have vetted this, I think, as much as we can vet it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8580)|
| 2:23:06| and I'm comfortable where we're at, and I want to move forward as we plan tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8586)|
| 2:23:11| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8591)|
| 2:23:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8592)|
| 2:23:13| I also would like to move forward with what we have decided the work we've put into this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8593)|
| 2:23:18| and get something to go to the voters and let the voters speak up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8598)|
| 2:23:24| I don't see any real value for our hashing this out again and again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8604)|
| 2:23:32| I think that we've --everybody pretty well knows where everybody stands or what they're thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8612)|
| 2:23:37| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8617)|
| 2:23:38| Well, I want to thank you, Vice Mayor, for your leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8618)|
| 2:23:41| You've shown through this ongoing process and Mr. Pennington and the administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8621)|
| 2:23:46| but I want to ask a question about the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8626)|
| 2:23:51| Once this goes and Dr. Lyons said they will take this to the pension board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8631)|
| 2:23:57| will it then come back to the council for our or will we be able to change a vote or tweak any way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8637)|
| 2:24:05| That's my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8645)|
| 2:24:06| When it comes back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8646)|
| 2:24:10| I'd recognize Mr. Gilbert on that perhaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8650)|
| 2:24:15| I think he'd be much better qualified to answer that than I would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8655)|
| 2:24:21| Thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8661)|
| 2:24:22| Bud Gilbert, General of Montgomery and Finley General Counsel to the Pension Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8662)|
| 2:24:26| 550 Main Street, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8666)|
| 2:24:30| Charter Section 1355, which was added in 2006 referendum and, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8670)|
| 2:24:37| approved by the city council, what we call the Charter Protection Provision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8677)|
| 2:24:42| says that at least 60 days before council considers this ordinance on first reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8682)|
| 2:24:48| which is June the 21st is the deadline, the language has to be filed in the pension board office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8688)|
| 2:24:55| Once that proposed ordinance is filed in the pension board office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8695)|
| 2:24:59| the pension board has 60 days to review it and issue a report to city council as to the form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8699)|
| 2:25:07| and effect of the proposed ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8707)|
| 2:25:09| and any recommended changes to protect the qualified status of this governmental pension system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8709)|
| 2:25:16| It goes back to council and then I don't have the schedule right in front of me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8716)|
| 2:25:22| but if the last date is June the 21st, I think you have an error,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8722)|
| 2:25:27| a margin on three different council meetings in order to get this passed on a first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8727)|
| 2:25:32| and second reading before it has to be published 60 days in the newspaper prior to the November 6, 2012 referendum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8732)|
| 2:25:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8741)|
| 2:25:44| I'm good with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8744)|
| 2:25:46| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8746)|
| 2:25:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8748)|
| 2:25:49| I'm fine to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8749)|
| 2:25:51| I think we've worked hard on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8751)|
| 2:25:52| But I want to bring up and I don't know how to get this on the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8752)|
| 2:26:00| I'm still a proponent of a ballot amendment that would remove the pension from underneath the guidance of the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8760)|
| 2:26:10| And I don't know how to get that on to discussion and how to get that on possibly on to the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8770)|
| 2:26:17| Well, that's a totally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8777)|
| 2:26:18| Well, go ahead, Mr. Gilbert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8778)|
| 2:26:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8780)|
| 2:26:21| I think it's a totally different issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8781)|
| 2:26:23| I refer to that as de-chartering the pension plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8783)|
| 2:26:28| And essentially it would be an ordinance that says shall Article 13 of the charter containing the actual terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8788)|
| 2:26:37| and provisions of the existing plans be deleted from the charter and recodified in a written pension plan document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8797)|
| 2:26:46| that is maintained by city council via ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8806)|
| 2:26:51| But it's a separate question from this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8811)|
| 2:26:53| That is entirely a separate issue than this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8813)|
| 2:26:57| The obvious political concern for any member of council is whether that scares employee groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8817)|
| 2:27:06| whether they think that is a dangerous move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8826)|
| 2:27:09| It has nothing to do with the Blackwell protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8829)|
| 2:27:13| Blackwell still applies whether the provisions of the pension plan are in the charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8833)|
| 2:27:18| or in a separately stated document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8838)|
| 2:27:21| Well, it has everything to do with where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8841)|
| 2:27:23| You're putting this plan back in and we can either decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8843)|
| 2:27:27| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8847)|
| 2:27:28| I think it has everything to do with where we are because it has the oversight of the current plan that we're working on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8848)|
| 2:27:33| We're putting it back into the charter under the same restrictions that you have now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8853)|
| 2:27:39| Same pension board and same, you know, same issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8859)|
| 2:27:42| I mean, I don't know how to bring it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8862)|
| 2:27:44| I'm trying to bring it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8864)|
| 2:27:45| I don't know how to bring it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8865)|
| 2:27:46| Whether I bring it up at council or bring it up here or we have to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8866)|
| 2:27:48| or maybe there's nobody else interested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8868)|
| 2:27:50| But I just think it's very cumbersome when you've got to make changes like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8870)|
| 2:27:58| and you're stacked up against all these deadlines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8878)|
| 2:28:00| And we've rushed, rushed, rushed all these meetings to try to get, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8880)|
| 2:28:03| before the pension board to get it on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8883)|
| 2:28:05| And I think it would be better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8885)|
| 2:28:08| Certainly, the power would be right here at council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8888)|
| 2:28:11| And then you'd have control of the pension board or at least some appointments to the pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8891)|
| 2:28:17| So, I don't know how to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8897)|
| 2:28:18| But that's something for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8898)|
| 2:28:20| My only point is it's separate from what we've been discussing these last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8900)|
| 2:28:26| Oh, yeah, it's a separate issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8906)|
| 2:28:28| But, I mean, it's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8908)|
| 2:28:29| I understand it's pertinent, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8909)|
| 2:28:32| And I would just direct you to Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8912)|
| 2:28:36| And he can, I'm sure, can give you guidance on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8916)|
| 2:28:39| Councilman Delval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8919)|
| 2:28:40| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8920)|
| 2:28:42| The reason I mentioned what I did a while back here was the notion that, you know, we, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8922)|
| 2:28:51| all seriously worked very hard on looking at a pension plan that divides risk between the employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8931)|
| 2:28:58| and the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8938)|
| 2:29:00| We looked at the various levers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8940)|
| 2:29:03| Alan has been really helpful in trying to help us analyze it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8943)|
| 2:29:07| And we've looked at a ton of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8947)|
| 2:29:10| And I think that this is a good plan in terms of sharing risk and in terms of market risk between the employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8950)|
| 2:29:22| and the citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8962)|
| 2:29:23| But there still remains a question in my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8963)|
| 2:29:26| And I think it's a significant one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8966)|
| 2:29:28| And I think that it was alluded to in part by what Marshall said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8968)|
| 2:29:32| And that was the current generation of young people are more mobile than their predecessors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8972)|
| 2:29:39| And in having a plan that actually is yours is a value for attracting them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8979)|
| 2:29:46| Now, maybe that's a detraction for them staying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8986)|
| 2:29:50| I don't know if that's true or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8990)|
| 2:29:52| I don't know that we have any information before us one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8992)|
| 2:29:55| But the thing that is certain going beyond that question of is it a better tool to recruit or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=8995)|
| 2:30:02| the thing that goes beyond that is a defined contribution plan has the city generously put forward dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9002)|
| 2:30:10| into an account along with the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9010)|
| 2:30:12| The city is going to put in more than the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9012)|
| 2:30:15| And the city has fiscal control of its future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9015)|
| 2:30:18| And that's the part that worries me the most still.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9018)|
| 2:30:22| As good as this effort has been to try to look at the various pieces of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9022)|
| 2:30:28| and make it an effective whole, there is still that element of the unknown that Europe blows up like it seems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9028)|
| 2:30:37| to be doing right now or the economy tanks for some reason that we don't anticipate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9037)|
| 2:30:42| And we bear a financial risk outside of the scope of what we're working on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9042)|
| 2:30:49| And so the defined contribution plan has some downside, I suppose, in the sense of is it an incentive to stay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9049)|
| 2:30:57| until you're 56 or 63 or whatever the years that we talked about were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9057)|
| 2:31:02| But the positive side is that it's your money in a pot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9062)|
| 2:31:07| It is what most of the taxpayers are living with personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9067)|
| 2:31:11| And when there is a down year, they suffer it and no one bails them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9071)|
| 2:31:16| And as a council who's charged with the fiscal responsibility for this city, it's certainly a tool that is more finite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9076)|
| 2:31:26| You can get your arms around it fairly quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9086)|
| 2:31:29| You've committed not just to pay your employees X dollars, but 109% of the dollars because you're putting 8%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9089)|
| 2:31:37| and 10% in the different pots that we're creating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9097)|
| 2:31:41| So that aspect still comes back to sort of haunt me a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9101)|
| 2:31:46| I mean, I was very much committed to us looking at this, seeing if we could work on the nuts and bolts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9106)|
| 2:31:52| And I think that was Mr. Wallace's suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9112)|
| 2:31:55| And again, it's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9115)|
| 2:31:57| Good employees are our only real tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9117)|
| 2:32:00| We don't market a product other than service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9120)|
| 2:32:04| And service comes from employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9124)|
| 2:32:06| On the other hand, managing costs in a world that could get tougher as we decline in the rise of China| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9126)|
| 2:32:15| and I don't know, maybe lose 30% of the marketplace if Europe goes down the toilet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9135)|
| 2:32:21| And the question is, will the taxpayers understand a defined contribution plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9141)|
| 2:32:27| Yes, they live with one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9147)|
| 2:32:29| Most of them do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9149)|
| 2:32:31| And two, will this city have a certain amount of fiscal certainty if they go that way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9151)|
| 2:32:37| Maybe the answer is that we're still where we were last week or two weeks ago when we were tackling this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9157)|
| 2:32:43| But I wonder if it isn't prudent to just ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9163)|
| 2:32:46| Now that we've seen sort of the inside of the store, where are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9166)|
| 2:32:50| And do we want to take another non-binding straw poll to just examine, are we going charging forward with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9170)|
| 2:32:56| Because if we are, then Bud's got to write up stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9176)|
| 2:32:59| He's got to second-guess them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9179)|
| 2:33:00| The law department will be working with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9180)|
| 2:33:02| We're going to want to probably talk to Mr. Cherry and his crew about various pieces of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9182)|
| 2:33:07| And I think we should just take our own temperature before we adjourn for the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9187)|
| 2:33:15| Given what Councilman Della Voppe said and the fact that we haven't heard from Councilman Campanile,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9195)|
| 2:33:20| I think we certainly don't really know where we stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9200)|
| 2:33:24| I don't know how we can, after what he said, to really say we know exactly where we stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9204)|
| 2:33:30| And here's my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9210)|
| 2:33:33| You know, we've been we've I think we had our first meeting April 9th or April 11th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9213)|
| 2:33:38| A long time ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9218)|
| 2:33:39| And it's May 14th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9219)|
| 2:33:41| So it's a week and a month and five days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9221)|
| 2:33:44| We have to get this to them before June 21st, which is about another it's almost like we're at the halfway point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9224)|
| 2:33:50| Then they look at it for 60 days and then we'll have to really vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9230)|
| 2:33:54| So my fear is that if we just send the hybrid plan, you know, I don't know where everybody's going to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9234)|
| 2:34:01| It doesn't seem like it's really set in stone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9241)|
| 2:34:03| Then they could come back and then we're really stuck with what we've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9243)|
| 2:34:09| And people may have changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9249)|
| 2:34:10| We may not have the votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9250)|
| 2:34:12| So I guess my question is maybe we should have a meeting like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9252)|
| 2:34:15| and create a defined contribution plan and send both plans to the pension board and have them sent back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9255)|
| 2:34:22| And that way when we vote on this in August, we'll have real options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9262)|
| 2:34:28| And, you know, and if it was clear, you know, if it was clear, I wouldn't be saying this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9268)|
| 2:34:32| But it's certainly not clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9272)|
| 2:34:34| I mean, there's only from what I can see, there's only four votes for this hybrid plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9274)|
| 2:34:39| And you all may change over the course of, you know, we're talking months, three months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9279)|
| 2:34:45| So is that even possible to send two proposals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9285)|
| 2:34:49| I mean, I looked at the charter today and it doesn't, there's no limit on the number that we can send for your review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9289)|
| 2:34:59| Dr. Lyons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9299)|
| 2:35:01| Well, I would just say the procedure we envisioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9301)|
| 2:35:03| and I think we discussed before was having a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9303)|
| 2:35:07| Not required, I think, but a resolution prior to sending whatever to the pension board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9307)|
| 2:35:12| and having it come back at some point prior to that where council would express its preference to send one plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9312)|
| 2:35:19| I would just say in the discussion tonight, not to reopen, I guess we are reopening all of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9319)|
| 2:35:24| We're getting away from the fact that what we had was always a given that there was some market risk in the hybrid plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9324)|
| 2:35:33| much reduced, much attenuated, versus, and this is what's not been discussed tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9333)|
| 2:35:38| that was discussed last time that led to the straw poll that we had last time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9338)|
| 2:35:41| which is versus all the impact on the personnel program of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9341)|
| 2:35:47| It's human resources program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9347)|
| 2:35:48| And I mean, it's like that, I think that is something we have to keep in mind as we discuss this in a holistic manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9348)|
| 2:35:56| And not get, you know, again, I don't think if we want zero market risk in the defined contribution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9356)|
| 2:36:04| and then risking all the things that we don't know, which are unknowns, that we talked about last time in recruitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9364)|
| 2:36:10| and retention and, again, the major difference between public and private employees, all of those factors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9370)|
| 2:36:16| I would just urge everybody to remember those because they're still relevant tonight just as they were last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9376)|
| 2:36:24| And that being we don't know about having people who have a defined contribution only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9384)|
| 2:36:30| and then feel unable to retire in fire and police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9390)|
| 2:36:33| and other major physically demanding jobs that we all rely on in a civil service atmosphere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9393)|
| 2:36:40| where they can hang on indefinitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9400)|
| 2:36:42| I mean, there are many, many issues there that are just as unknown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9402)|
| 2:36:46| and I think are much more threatening to the well-being of the city than purely the market risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9406)|
| 2:36:51| That's the balance which led to the straw poll last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9411)|
| 2:36:55| So I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9415)|
| 2:36:56| This then has taken the hybrid plan, we've fleshed it out, we've put in the levers, we've put in the protections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9416)|
| 2:37:01| So I guess I'm somewhat quizzical and I'm sure the mayor had to leave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9421)|
| 2:37:05| but I know she would be as to why we're, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9425)|
| 2:37:08| why we would eliminate those other considerations from our consideration tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9428)|
| 2:37:12| And I don't think anybody wants to stay and rehash that debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9432)|
| 2:37:15| I think we've had that discussion ad nauseum probably, if not ad infinitum, almost over the past number of weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9435)|
| 2:37:21| I would just make that statement that our presumption was council would take a straw poll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9441)|
| 2:37:27| We'd prepare this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9447)|
| 2:37:28| There would be one plan sent to the pension board, possibly by resolution of council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9448)|
| 2:37:34| where the will of council was expressed that would then be prepared, as Mr. Gilbert said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9454)|
| 2:37:38| and come back to council for final considerations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9458)|
| 2:37:40| Meantime, the public could become comfortable with what was out there, educated on what was out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9460)|
| 2:37:45| because this is a critical vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9465)|
| 2:37:48| And I'll add one final thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9468)|
| 2:37:49| If this critical vote fails, you've got what we have now, which we all know is much more expensive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9469)|
| 2:37:54| has all the risk on the city, is unsustainable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9474)|
| 2:37:58| So I would just end with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9478)|
| 2:38:01| I think that Mayor Guerrero feels very strongly about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9481)|
| 2:38:04| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9484)|
| 2:38:05| Just a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9485)|
| 2:38:07| I think last at our last workshop, I believe Councilman Grieve asked that very question about whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9487)|
| 2:38:14| we could or would it be a good idea to send two plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9494)|
| 2:38:19| Didn't you ask that last week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9499)|
| 2:38:21| On the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9501)|
| 2:38:22| On the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9502)|
| 2:38:23| And I was glad you asked it, because I was wondering about it myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9503)|
| 2:38:27| But I think last week at our discussion, it was decided or maybe not decided that it would be a little less cumbersome| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9507)|
| 2:38:38| to the voters if they had one plan to vote on, up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9518)|
| 2:38:43| But I know that Councilman Grieve brought that up last workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9523)|
| 2:38:52| Real briefly, I just heard Bill Lyons give all the reasons why the hybrid that we've been working on to make good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9532)|
| 2:39:00| should be adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9540)|
| 2:39:01| But, again, all we had was a straw poll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9541)|
| 2:39:03| It's not a binding poll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9543)|
| 2:39:05| And now that we've seen the inside of the elephant, I think we ought to make sure that we're going here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9545)|
| 2:39:11| And if the answer is, yes, we're going here, let's go full speed ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9551)|
| 2:39:14| And let's get the lawyers doing their thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9554)|
| 2:39:17| And let's get the resolutions going and all that stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9557)|
| 2:39:20| But the straw poll wasn't a final poll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9560)|
| 2:39:22| I think we need to be sure that we're going where we think we're going and we want to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9562)|
| 2:39:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9568)|
| 2:39:29| Let's take a straw poll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9569)|
| 2:39:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9570)|
| 2:39:31| Mr. Lewis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9571)|
| 2:39:32| I mean, if we're going to have it as a resolution, should we just vote on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9572)|
| 2:39:39| Because Councilman De La Vope's point is it's a straw poll, it's a straw poll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9579)|
| 2:39:44| So if we had it as a resolution in two weeks, I guess from tomorrow, then that would be it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9584)|
| 2:39:54| I mean, I do have a general concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9594)|
| 2:39:56| I think Councilman De La Vope can change a couple times during a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9596)|
| 2:39:59| So over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9599)|
| 2:40:02| I think that's what we're talking about here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9602)|
| 2:40:04| I don't see anybody else that's changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9604)|
| 2:40:06| But when you only have five votes and one changes, that does change things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9606)|
| 2:40:11| So I would hate to realize that in August, that the plan that's been reviewed for two months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9611)|
| 2:40:18| by the pension board doesn't have the votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9618)|
| 2:40:20| So that's why I proposed two options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9620)|
| 2:40:23| That way we know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9623)|
| 2:40:24| I mean, I think one of them would pass in August when we vote on this for real, no straw polls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9624)|
| 2:40:34| That's just my thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9634)|
| 2:40:36| And then that gives us more time to hear from the employees and more time to hear from the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9636)|
| 2:40:42| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9642)|
| 2:40:44| Vice Mayor, would it be appropriate to have an official vote tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9644)|
| 2:40:49| That would not do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9649)|
| 2:40:51| We just have a straw poll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9651)|
| 2:40:53| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9653)|
| 2:40:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9654)|
| 2:40:55| That's all we can do this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9655)|
| 2:40:56| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9656)|
| 2:40:57| My light's not working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9657)|
| 2:40:58| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9658)|
| 2:40:59| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9659)|
| 2:41:03| I understand that this is extremely complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9663)|
| 2:41:09| My question is if we wait until some kind of resolution comes to council, what happens to the prep time that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9669)|
| 2:41:17| needed to work on the language of the charter amendment that's going to the pension board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9677)|
| 2:41:28| then back to council, and then ultimately to the voters?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9688)|
| 2:41:31| Our assumption, if I could answer that, is very much we would like a straw poll tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9691)|
| 2:41:35| as has been suggested, so that folks can get to work on that resolution, on that language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9695)|
| 2:41:42| It could later formally be sent by resolution or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9702)|
| 2:41:45| That was just one avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9705)|
| 2:41:47| It's not required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9707)|
| 2:41:48| But I think, you know, the sooner the better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9708)|
| 2:41:50| Now, here it is in almost the middle of May, and we've got until June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9710)|
| 2:41:53| The folks need to start working on this with clear direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9713)|
| 2:41:57| So we would, I think a straw poll would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9717)|
| 2:42:01| Councilman Kampen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9721)|
| 2:42:02| Well, I'm never one to be rushed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9722)|
| 2:42:06| I mean, really, this is a huge deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9726)|
| 2:42:08| And we can take straw polls until the cows come home, and it's not a binding vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9728)|
| 2:42:13| I don't know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9733)|
| 2:42:14| I mean, I like what we've worked on tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9734)|
| 2:42:16| I think that's great, what we've whittled to this hybrid plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9736)|
| 2:42:20| But if, you know, unless it's a huge burden to go forward with, you know, Marshall's idea, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9740)|
| 2:42:28| just to have that one or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9748)|
| 2:42:31| And I don't even recall exactly what the other than, you know, the mayor's administration's response was about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9751)|
| 2:42:40| you know, putting, I guess, like you said, Councilman Brown, the cumbersome nature of putting both on the ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9760)|
| 2:42:47| you know, letting the voters decide one way or the other, which, you know, it's either this or it's this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9767)|
| 2:42:53| And I don't know, maybe that's too much for the voters to take on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9773)|
| 2:42:57| I don't think they're ignorant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9777)|
| 2:43:00| The questions have to be yes, no questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9780)|
| 2:43:03| So to have two, you could risk having no pension plan, if both lost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9783)|
| 2:43:07| or two conflicting pension plans approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9787)|
| 2:43:10| There really has to be one clear pension change item on the ballot, in our opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9790)|
| 2:43:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9796)|
| 2:43:19| If I could just say, I think he's right that one question is clearer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9799)|
| 2:43:24| But I disagree to some point, and that is that you could have a statement that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9804)|
| 2:43:31| we're proposing to close the current plan, the current defined benefit plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9811)|
| 2:43:37| and we're asking you to select either A, a defined contribution plan, or B, a hybrid plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9817)|
| 2:43:45| both of which have been vetted by your council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9825)|
| 2:43:47| I mean, they can say yes to A or yes to B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9827)|
| 2:43:50| We've got the attorneys shaking their heads over here going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9830)|
| 2:43:53| You can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9833)|
| 2:43:54| Only one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9834)|
| 2:43:56| A question has to have a yes, no answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9836)|
| 2:43:59| It can't be framed any other way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9839)|
| 2:44:01| It can't be an if, then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9841)|
| 2:44:03| And all the more reason why we should know where we're going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9843)|
| 2:44:08| One question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9848)|
| 2:44:11| The thing that, one of the things that troubles me the most is that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9851)|
| 2:44:15| and I don't know about my colleagues, but the number of people who have talked to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9855)|
| 2:44:20| I'm talking about our constituents, I'm talking about the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9860)|
| 2:44:24| The one thing that they keep saying to me is, you're not making any changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9864)|
| 2:44:29| What you're doing is you're still having a defined contribution plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9869)|
| 2:44:33| I mean, excuse me, a defined benefit plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9873)|
| 2:44:36| And, you know, I deal with an awful lot of contractors and subcontractors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9876)|
| 2:44:41| a lot of people out there that are scratching by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9881)|
| 2:44:45| And I'm just not sure that, and I don't know how you do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9885)|
| 2:44:50| I can't, but what I'm concerned about is that what we're coming up with, we're not going to be able to sell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9890)|
| 2:44:55| And it's not going to pass because the perception is that it's much like what we already have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9895)|
| 2:45:01| And so that's where I think there's a major problem out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9901)|
| 2:45:05| And there's a major problem that, you know, we need to get a feel for the taxpayer in terms of what they're going to go with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9905)|
| 2:45:11| So I think that's a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9911)|
| 2:45:14| And I'll disagree because I've been very ably been able to communicate the changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9914)|
| 2:45:20| And they're significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9920)|
| 2:45:22| And I think it's a disservice if we don't move forward with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9922)|
| 2:45:25| I mean, this is, we're a service organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9925)|
| 2:45:28| We're not a 12-week cycle report to Wall Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9928)|
| 2:45:31| I mean, the people that I represent want good services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9931)|
| 2:45:37| And the only way we can do that, like Councilman Wallace alluded to, is if we've got a good product| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9937)|
| 2:45:41| and that's our people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9941)|
| 2:45:43| And that's all we're selling here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9943)|
| 2:45:45| And it's, you know, it's tremendously been reduced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9945)|
| 2:45:49| The risk, the employees are having to invest greater amounts of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9949)|
| 2:45:55| And they've come with their hat in their hand, basically, and said, we know there's a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9955)|
| 2:46:00| And we're willing, we're willing to, you know, make these changes for the next people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9960)|
| 2:46:06| And, you know, the ones that I'm talking to, I'm expressing the differences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9966)|
| 2:46:11| And I think they're vast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9971)|
| 2:46:13| Well, I agree, Nick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9973)|
| 2:46:16| I mean, I've had no problem communicating this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9976)|
| 2:46:19| Anybody who wants to listen, these are huge changes what we're making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9979)|
| 2:46:23| You're putting, you have really changed the way the employees are going to face their,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9983)|
| 2:46:29| with their pension plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9989)|
| 2:46:31| And that's very easy to distinguish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9991)|
| 2:46:33| And that's very easy to communicate to constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9993)|
| 2:46:36| Anybody who wants to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9996)|
| 2:46:37| Now, the problem is they don't care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9997)|
| 2:46:39| Not much past about 60 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=9999)|
| 2:46:43| Because, but it's very easy to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10003)|
| 2:46:45| I've not had any resistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10005)|
| 2:46:47| Yes, we're making changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10007)|
| 2:46:48| We're making huge changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10008)|
| 2:46:49| You're pushing the risk over to the employee half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10009)|
| 2:46:53| They have zero now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10013)|
| 2:46:55| So we've increased their risk by a tremendous amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10015)|
| 2:46:58| And we've cut their benefits by a tremendous amount over the life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10018)|
| 2:47:02| But nothing's going to fix the plan you have now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10022)|
| 2:47:04| And we all know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10024)|
| 2:47:06| And it's not 40,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10026)|
| 2:47:08| We're not guaranteeing them 40,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10028)|
| 2:47:10| We're guaranteeing them 24,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10030)|
| 2:47:13| I mean, it's a huge difference of where we are now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10033)|
| 2:47:16| And you've asked the employees to do a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10036)|
| 2:47:18| Is there a time, will there be a time in the future where employees want to be, as Mr. Stare says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10038)|
| 2:47:23| that they want to be mobile and change it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10043)|
| 2:47:25| They may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10045)|
| 2:47:26| And it may push it to a city council out there in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10046)|
| 2:47:30| But we've got to make the decision what's best right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10050)|
| 2:47:33| And given the employees that you have, given the management style and how you're going to deal with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10053)|
| 2:47:39| you have no plan for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10059)|
| 2:47:41| You go to define contribution, you don't have a plan for how you're going to interact with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10061)|
| 2:47:46| and how that's going to impact your employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10066)|
| 2:47:49| You can't take that big a risk and change it all at once with 1,500 employees, given where you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10069)|
| 2:47:56| This is a logical step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10076)|
| 2:47:58| It's a big step down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10078)|
| 2:48:00| It's a gradual plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10080)|
| 2:48:02| In 10 years or sometime in the future, you're going to come back and go all define contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10082)|
| 2:48:08| You very well may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10088)|
| 2:48:09| And it doesn't limit us to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10089)|
| 2:48:11| But the risk of changing that all at once, given where you are, is, I think, it's inconceivable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10091)|
| 2:48:18| To manage through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10098)|
| 2:48:19| I've got employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10099)|
| 2:48:21| I've got sales people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10101)|
| 2:48:22| I've got compensation plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10102)|
| 2:48:24| You make a strong change, a radical change in the middle of something, you're creating quite a bit of risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10104)|
| 2:48:32| And that's what employees are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10112)|
| 2:48:34| You're here to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10114)|
| 2:48:35| You're here to support them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10115)|
| 2:48:37| And people that might complain, well, I only have define contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10117)|
| 2:48:41| I only have define contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10121)|
| 2:48:44| But they're not working for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10124)|
| 2:48:46| And they're not working for a government, you know, employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10126)|
| 2:48:49| So, it's far, far different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10129)|
| 2:48:51| They're not putting their lives at risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10131)|
| 2:48:52| My employees aren't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10132)|
| 2:48:54| So, I think that you've got to be cautious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10134)|
| 2:48:57| And I think this is a very logical step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10137)|
| 2:48:59| You want to do a strong poll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10139)|
| 2:49:00| We've got to get to some consensus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10140)|
| 2:49:02| When we vote on this, we've got to go out there in the marketplace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10142)|
| 2:49:06| and convince the constituents that this is the best plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10146)|
| 2:49:10| It will not work if this is a divided council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10150)|
| 2:49:13| We have got to step out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10153)|
| 2:49:15| When we vote, we've got to step out and we're unified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10155)|
| 2:49:18| And whether you agree with it or not, personally, we're voting as a legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10158)|
| 2:49:23| And we've got to move into the marketplace and say why we think this is a good plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10163)|
| 2:49:27| If you get out there and say, well, I didn't vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10167)|
| 2:49:29| I don't think it's a good plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10169)|
| 2:49:30| I think it would be a fine contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10170)|
| 2:49:32| Yeah, you're going to undermine the effects of what we've spent this time working on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10172)|
| 2:49:36| We're here as a body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10176)|
| 2:49:38| We're here as one unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10178)|
| 2:49:39| And we've got to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10179)|
| 2:49:40| And we've got to be unified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10180)|
| 2:49:41| And I think we're making, if we come here and split and everything's split,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10181)|
| 2:49:45| and we come here 4-4 and a pass, guys, we're in, you know, we've wasted a lot of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10185)|
| 2:49:52| And if we wait and vote on it in August and you want to risk it until August,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10192)|
| 2:49:57| what I'm saying is this is what this is the best for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10197)|
| 2:49:59| I'm not willing to risk waiting all the way to August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10199)|
| 2:50:02| Philosophically, I'm not going to change my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10202)|
| 2:50:05| Because a numbers game, yes, it's the greatest thing in the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10205)|
| 2:50:09| Got to find a contribution and take all the risk out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10209)|
| 2:50:12| But for the employees and for the benefit of the city long term, it's a bad decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10212)|
| 2:50:17| And so, I mean, I've come to grips with it philosophically, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10217)|
| 2:50:21| and we've made them prudent business people to look at the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10221)|
| 2:50:25| That's one more comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10225)|
| 2:50:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10226)|
| 2:50:27| I have two points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10227)|
| 2:50:29| One is that many of our employees are vested taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10229)|
| 2:50:33| They're vested in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10233)|
| 2:50:35| They're also taxpayers in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10235)|
| 2:50:37| We have had members of the community come and speak to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10237)|
| 2:50:40| I have had people and maybe my constituency, particularly in my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10240)|
| 2:50:44| may not be maybe in a spot to better understand the two options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10244)|
| 2:50:50| But I think there's another point that we all need to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10250)|
| 2:50:54| When Madeline Rojero was elected mayor last November, she had an incredible mandate from the voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10254)|
| 2:51:02| The voters of this city spoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10262)|
| 2:51:05| They put their confidence in her to be our leader for the next four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10265)|
| 2:51:10| She got a mandate far greater than any person sitting on this council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10270)|
| 2:51:15| And I think that as a council, we need to listen to that mandate the voters gave her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10275)|
| 2:51:21| They had confidence in her ability, in her decision-making, and her leadership of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10281)|
| 2:51:27| And I think that if this council does not support her hybrid plan, and particularly with things we've done tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10287)|
| 2:51:33| and the revisions that are in it, then we're basically saying to the voters, well, you didn't count.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10293)|
| 2:51:39| We don't have to listen to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10299)|
| 2:51:41| And I think that we do need to listen to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10301)|
| 2:51:43| And I think there was a real clear mandate in electing Mayor Rojero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10303)|
| 2:51:48| This is the plan that she thinks would best benefit the services that we provide to the voters, the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10308)|
| 2:51:56| And that is what we are, is a service business, whether we like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10316)|
| 2:52:01| People want their garbage picked up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10321)|
| 2:52:03| They want their streets paved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10323)|
| 2:52:05| They want to feel safe in their homes and their neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10325)|
| 2:52:09| And anything that we do that jeopardizes that means that, as council members, we have been very derelict in our duties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10329)|
| 2:52:17| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10337)|
| 2:52:19| Thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10339)|
| 2:52:21| Earlier, I made some remarks, and I'm not comfortable, and I think that's well known.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10341)|
| 2:52:27| Nevertheless, we have been through a process that's been very rigorous, and tonight we put some meat on these bones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10347)|
| 2:52:36| I had prepared myself to then take that step that Councilman Wallace mentioned and get behind this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10356)|
| 2:52:43| and see it all the way through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10363)|
| 2:52:47| And I think we need to quit second-guessing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10367)|
| 2:52:51| We need to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10371)|
| 2:52:52| I thought we had put that item to bed last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10372)|
| 2:52:55| Well, I did not agree with the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10375)|
| 2:52:57| I accepted it, and it moved on, and I know it's not a binding vote, but I just want to move on with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10377)|
| 2:53:04| and go ahead and work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10384)|
| 2:53:06| We do have a timeline, and it's fairly short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10386)|
| 2:53:09| We do not have until June the 21st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10389)|
| 2:53:12| There is a prep time that our lawyers must have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10392)|
| 2:53:15| So I think we need to put whatever we can to bed tonight and give them the proper time to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10395)|
| 2:53:22| Councilman Stern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10402)|
| 2:53:24| Well, I mean, just on a couple different issues, I mean, I certainly understand where you all come from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10404)|
| 2:53:32| and I think you know where I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10412)|
| 2:53:33| The problem is, I mean, I don't count to an easy five, and we've still got the problem of three months down the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10413)|
| 2:53:40| of when we're actually going to be taking the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10420)|
| 2:53:42| That's my concern, you know, and I certainly have all the respect in the world for the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10422)|
| 2:53:49| but, I mean, that wasn't a central campaign issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10429)|
| 2:53:52| That wasn't, I mean, it was an issue, but, I mean, there wasn't a hybrid versus one plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10432)|
| 2:53:58| I don't think you can say that that's what the voters want just because they, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10438)|
| 2:54:03| overwhelmingly supported her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10443)|
| 2:54:08| You know, the problem is we don't have, you know, five firmly committed one way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10448)|
| 2:54:14| I mean, is that not the problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10454)|
| 2:54:16| We don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10456)|
| 2:54:17| We don't know yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10457)|
| 2:54:18| We don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10458)|
| 2:54:19| I think we got five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10459)|
| 2:54:21| Should we do a straw poll or, I mean, I don't want to keep beating a dead horse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10461)|
| 2:54:25| I think that's the answer in the lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10465)|
| 2:54:27| I didn't mean to want to beat a dead horse, but it was just Councilman De La Vopace sort of talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10467)|
| 2:54:32| I'm a live horse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10472)|
| 2:54:33| Oh, thanks a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10473)|
| 2:54:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10474)|
| 2:54:36| Bishop, quickly, either Mr. Pennington or Dr. Lyons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10476)|
| 2:54:41| do you all have any concluding remarks before I call for this vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10481)|
| 2:54:45| I think we would prefer a straw poll that gave firm guidance tonight to folks to begin working on one plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10485)|
| 2:54:52| to take forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10492)|
| 2:54:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10493)|
| 2:54:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10494)|
| 2:54:55| Mr. Pennington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10495)|
| 2:54:56| I was just going to say I really appreciate all the work that's been done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10496)|
| 2:54:58| and I think it would be a shame if we ended up putting a 401K with a lot of dissension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10498)|
| 2:55:01| It didn't pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10501)|
| 2:55:03| Then we ended up with the same plan that we've got now, and we haven't made any progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10503)|
| 2:55:07| Very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10507)|
| 2:55:08| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10508)|
| 2:55:09| Well, and I also want to reiterate something that Councilman Wallace said a moment ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10509)|
| 2:55:13| that this probably will not be our only visitation with pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10513)|
| 2:55:19| I think we're going to have other opportunities as we move on through the next two, four, six, eight years, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10519)|
| 2:55:25| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10525)|
| 2:55:26| I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10526)|
| 2:55:27| Ms. Wilson, if you'll call the roll, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10527)|
| 2:55:29| Yes, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10529)|
| 2:55:30| Well, we're voting on whether, yes, just as we did last time, this hybrid plan or defined contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10530)|
| 2:55:42| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10542)|
| 2:55:44| Hybrid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10544)|
| 2:55:46| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10546)|
| 2:55:48| Uncomfortably hybrid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10548)|
| 2:55:51| Councilman Steyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10551)|
| 2:55:53| Defined contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10553)|
| 2:55:55| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10555)|
| 2:55:56| Hybrid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10556)|
| 2:55:58| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10558)|
| 2:55:59| Hybrid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10559)|
| 2:56:01| Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10561)|
| 2:56:02| Hybrid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10562)|
| 2:56:04| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10564)|
| 2:56:06| Defined contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10566)|
| 2:56:08| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10568)|
| 2:56:09| Defined contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10569)|
| 2:56:11| Councilman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10571)|
| 2:56:13| Hybrid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10573)|
| 2:56:15| We're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10575)|
| 2:56:16| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10576)|
| 2:56:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10583)|
| 2:56:24| We have two folks that signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10584)|
| 2:56:28| And first is Anita Cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10588)|
| 2:56:30| Do what you have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10590)|
| 2:56:37| You have five minutes if you'll give your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10597)|
| 2:56:40| Anita Cash, 160 Bird Road, Lenore City, Tennessee, representing the general government employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10600)|
| 2:56:47| Members of Council, Vice Mayor Pavlis, I want to thank you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10607)|
| 2:56:52| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10612)|
| 2:56:57| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10617)|
| 2:56:58| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10618)|
| 2:56:59| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10619)|
| 2:57:01| I believe you all get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10621)|
| 2:57:04| You all, all of you, were elected to represent the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10624)|
| 2:57:08| And as Councilwoman Palmer said a little bit ago, not everybody lives in Lenore City| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10628)|
| 2:57:14| and not every city employee lives outside the city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10634)|
| 2:57:18| I respected what you said, Councilman, Vice Mayor Pavlis, when you said that we had met,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10638)|
| 2:57:24| and we had talked, and we just about beat this to death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10644)|
| 2:57:26| And you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10646)|
| 2:57:27| We have met and met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10647)|
| 2:57:29| And we've talked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10649)|
| 2:57:30| And we've talked behind the scenes many times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10650)|
| 2:57:33| And we've taken one straw poll, and we move forward with this, taking you at your word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10653)|
| 2:57:38| And I'm glad to see that the straw poll tonight even more definitely shows that we are moving in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10658)|
| 2:57:45| I just want to express to you, and this is Councilman Wallace, you are right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10665)|
| 2:57:52| We are giving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10672)|
| 2:57:54| We realize there is a significant problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10674)|
| 2:57:57| And we have given, and we have given, and we have given, not just general government employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10677)|
| 2:58:03| but all employees have given because we wanted to lessen the risks to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10683)|
| 2:58:11| So to say that there's not significant changes, and I agree with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10691)|
| 2:58:15| anybody that wants to understand it can understand it, but most of them don't want to understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10695)|
| 2:58:22| And I just want to thank you for your diligence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10702)|
| 2:58:24| And I did want to say that we have and we will continue to give to do what it takes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10704)|
| 2:58:29| We're not a defined contribution employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10709)|
| 2:58:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10712)|
| 2:58:37| Joel Goucher?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10717)|
| 2:58:41| I didn't botch that too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10721)|
| 2:58:44| Joel Goucher, 11918 Abner's Ridge Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10724)|
| 2:58:47| Just wanted to, I'm the vice president of the Firefighters Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10727)|
| 2:58:51| and I wanted to not go backwards, but I do want to bring up an issue here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10731)|
| 2:58:55| and discuss something that's significant to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10735)|
| 2:59:00| The drop plan has been eliminated for the future pension system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10740)|
| 2:59:05| and I've not had anybody be able to explain to me why it has been eliminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10745)|
| 2:59:10| Myself and many other people have addressed the issue of the cost of a drop plan in the retirement system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10750)|
| 2:59:19| No one has been able to define any cost associated with having a drop plan within the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10759)|
| 2:59:27| Basically, in case you don't understand the way the system works, a very quick outline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10767)|
| 2:59:31| the employee signs up on the drop plan after they've achieved their years of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10771)|
| 2:59:36| That employee stops the clock on the benefits being accrued on their retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10776)|
| 2:59:42| Then they continue to work a two-year time frame that the money that they have contributing to their retirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10782)|
| 2:59:50| then goes into a savings account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10790)|
| 2:59:52| The employee funds that savings account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10792)|
| 2:59:55| That lump sum that they leave with is funded by the employee, not by the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10795)|
| 3:00:02| There have been some people out on the media| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10802)|
| 3:00:04| and other places that have accused the employees of double dipping the system when they're on the drop plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10804)|
| 3:00:09| That is not correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10809)|
| 3:00:11| The employee is funding that lump sum by their own contributions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10811)|
| 3:00:18| The reason a drop plan is good for the employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10818)|
| 3:00:21| and for the department is because it allows them to project and fill vacancies that come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10821)|
| 3:00:27| We have three people right now on the fire trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10827)|
| 3:00:32| We don't have the luxury of just dropping out and trying to fill people that retire on the back end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10832)|
| 3:00:41| We have to be able to project those people, and this allows them to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10841)|
| 3:00:46| It allows the experienced people to stay and help train the new people that come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10846)|
| 3:00:53| Essentially, what you're getting is a 27-year employee for the cost of a 25-year employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10853)|
| 3:00:59| with that experience that you're getting with somebody who's on the drop plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10859)|
| 3:01:04| It's definitely one of the most important recruitment tools that the fire department specifically has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10864)|
| 3:01:11| I came here from Massachusetts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10871)|
| 3:01:13| and it was one of the first things that was described to me as I was entering into trying to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10873)|
| 3:01:19| into the city of Knoxville's fire department was the fact that there's a drop plan here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10879)|
| 3:01:24| that provides a good benefit for the employee, but it's a good benefit for the city as well and without cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10884)|
| 3:01:31| So I just want that for your consideration as you go forward moving with these plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10891)|
| 3:01:40| And very quickly, the other thing I want to touch on is the discussions about the shared risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10900)|
| 3:01:46| And I just want to make sure that everyone here is aware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10906)|
| 3:01:50| The employees of the city of Knoxville have contributed their obligated share to the retirement fund as they've been required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10910)|
| 3:02:00| From the date of the inception of this pension system, we have not failed to contribute our share one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10920)|
| 3:02:07| And although I know that past councils and past city administrations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10927)|
| 3:02:13| you guys here sitting here tonight are not necessarily responsible for their decisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10933)|
| 3:02:20| from the inception of this pension system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10940)|
| 3:02:22| the city has failed to contribute upwards of $90 million to the pension fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10942)|
| 3:02:29| So although the employees have contributed our share without fail, the city has failed to contribute their share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10949)|
| 3:02:38| And yet now we're being asked to bear the weight of all the changes so that we can have a sustainable system going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10958)|
| 3:02:48| To me, that's throwing it all on us again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10968)|
| 3:02:52| And by closing the current system and starting a new system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10972)|
| 3:02:59| you're putting the onus on the employees once again to fix the problem that was created by essentially by the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10979)|
| 3:03:12| If you'll wrap it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10992)|
| 3:03:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10993)|
| 3:03:14| Just tonight, but in all of these pension workshop meetings, I've seen a lot of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=10994)|
| 3:03:21| And they're good questions, but it boils down to true knowledge on the subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=11001)|
| 3:03:26| And I feel like there's just not enough full knowledge on the part of everyone involved in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=11006)|
| 3:03:32| to be able to just throw a system out there and put it to the voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=11012)|
| 3:03:37| And I would just ask the council to kind of put on the brakes a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=11017)|
| 3:03:42| No changes are going to be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=11022)|
| 3:03:44| No changes are going to be reflected in this system for upwards of 20 years in savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=11024)|
| 3:03:52| If we wait a little more time and let everybody share in the risks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=11032)|
| 3:03:57| and share in the benefits and get a proper plan put forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=11037)|
| 3:04:01| I think that we can more adequately support the plan and we can all move forward together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=11041)|
| 3:04:07| and share the risks and the benefits of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=11047)|
| 3:04:10| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=11050)|
| 3:04:13| We stand adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120514pension?start=11053)|
