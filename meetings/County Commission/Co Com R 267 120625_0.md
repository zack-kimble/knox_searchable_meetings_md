| 0:06:39| This is a resolution honoring the Bearden High School baseball team for an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=399)|
| 0:06:43| outstanding season and for earning the title of runner-up at the Class AAA state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=403)|
| 0:06:49| tournament.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=409)|
| 0:06:50| Commissioners Owenby and Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=410)|
| 0:06:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=416)|
| 0:06:57| Commissioner Norman be added to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=417)|
| 0:06:59| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=419)|
| 0:07:00| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=420)|
| 0:07:01| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=421)|
| 0:07:02| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=422)|
| 0:07:03| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=423)|
| 0:07:04| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=424)|
| 0:07:05| And Commissioner Shouse, you and Commissioner Norman and Owenby are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=425)|
| 0:07:07| recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=427)|
| 0:07:08| Do you want it read in the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=428)|
| 0:07:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=434)|
| 0:07:17| Whereas the Bearden High School baseball team recently played in the Class| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=437)|
| 0:07:21| AAA state championship game but fell short against Arlington with a final| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=441)|
| 0:07:26| score of 9-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=446)|
| 0:07:27| And whereas this outstanding team effort set a new standard for the Bearden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=447)|
| 0:07:31| baseball program by reaching the state championship for the first time in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=451)|
| 0:07:35| school's history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=455)|
| 0:07:38| Whereas the Bearden High School baseball team finished the season with an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=458)|
| 0:07:41| impressive 32-14 record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=461)|
| 0:07:44| And whereas the team's hard work, commitment to teamwork, and perseverance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=464)|
| 0:07:48| were all contributing factors to their successful season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=468)|
| 0:07:51| Now, therefore, be it resolved by the Commission of Knox County as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=471)|
| 0:07:55| The Commission of Knox County hereby honors and congratulates the Bearden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=475)|
| 0:07:59| High School baseball team for an outstanding 2012 season culminating in their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=479)|
| 0:08:04| runner-up title at the Class AAA state tournament.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=484)|

| 0:08:12| High School baseball team and coach Jack Tate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=492)|
| 0:08:15| Be it further resolved that this resolution is to take effect from and after its| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=495)|
| 0:08:19| passage as provided by the Charter of Knox County, Tennessee, the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=499)|

| 0:08:26| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=506)|
| 0:08:28| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=508)|
| 0:08:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=509)|
| 0:08:30| And congratulations, of course, to the Bearden baseball team, the coaching| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=510)|
| 0:08:34| staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=514)|
| 0:08:35| I'm an old West High Rebel and played baseball there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=515)|
| 0:08:39| But we never had any of the success, none, that Bearden has in baseball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=519)|
| 0:08:44| So and also congratulations to the parents that are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=524)|
| 0:08:48| There's probably no more joyful time than I had watching my son play baseball| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=528)|
| 0:08:55| and enjoying their successes, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=535)|
| 0:08:58| So congratulations to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=538)|
| 0:09:01| And don't live it vicariously too long, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=541)|
| 0:09:05| I want to warn you it's a hard separation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=545)|
| 0:09:08| I'll be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=548)|
| 0:09:12| Just congratulations to the Bearden baseball team for such a great honor and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=552)|
| 0:09:17| all the games you won and the honor that you've brought to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=557)|
| 0:09:21| And thanks for coming down today in the middle of your summer vacation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=561)|
| 0:09:24| I know how easy it is to take three or four hours off during the school year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=564)|
| 0:09:27| and come downtown and goof around and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=567)|
| 0:09:29| But in the middle of summer, I appreciate you coming down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=569)|
| 0:09:32| Congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=572)|
| 0:09:33| I appreciate you all honoring our baseball team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=573)|
| 0:09:37| I want to thank all 36 players in our program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=577)|
| 0:09:40| And I had five of the best assistant coaches you could ever imagine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=580)|
| 0:09:44| Assistant coach Buddy Wilker is here with me today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=584)|
| 0:09:47| He's been with the program for nine years as a coach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=587)|
| 0:09:49| And he was a player back in the mid-'90s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=589)|
| 0:09:52| And we have some of the greatest parents you could ever imagine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=592)|
| 0:09:55| grandparents, uncles, aunts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=595)|
| 0:09:57| And I worked for one of the best principals, Dr. John Bartlett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=597)|
| 0:10:00| and the entire administration at Bearden High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=600)|
| 0:10:02| It makes coaching be a real pleasure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=602)|
| 0:10:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=604)|
| 0:10:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=605)|
| 0:10:06| And would you like to recognize the young men that are with you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=606)|
| 0:10:10| You guys can come down so I can see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=610)|
| 0:10:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=615)|
| 0:10:16| We have Zach Messing, Josh Smith, Derek Lance, Zach Sale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=616)|

| 0:10:45| Thank you, commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=645)|
| 0:10:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=646)|
| 0:10:47| Job well done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=647)|
| 0:10:48| Job well done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=648)|
| 0:10:56| We have no other resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=656)|
| 0:10:58| We do have some people who have signed up to speak at public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=658)|
| 0:11:03| And Jeanine Ugarte.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=663)|
| 0:11:12| If you could give us your address for the record, please,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=672)|
| 0:11:15| and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=675)|
| 0:11:17| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=677)|
| 0:11:18| My name is Jeanine de la Torre Ugarte, 1117 Kevin Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37923.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=678)|
| 0:11:25| Thank you for allowing me to be here addressing you this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=685)|
| 0:11:29| I am a Knox County resident, and I would like to ask you not to fund the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=689)|
| 0:11:34| implementation of 287G.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=694)|
| 0:11:36| This is an agreement to give a group of officers from the sheriff's department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=696)|
| 0:11:41| the added responsibility to become immigration agents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=701)|
| 0:11:45| Many cities and counties across the country did not enter into this agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=705)|
| 0:11:50| because law enforcement saw that it would undermine the relationship they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=710)|
| 0:11:55| had with the immigrant community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=715)|
| 0:11:58| In other places, it was implemented, creating chaos and abuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=718)|
| 0:12:03| The Office of the Inspector General from the Department of Homeland Security| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=723)|
| 0:12:08| issued two reports in 2010 that found problems and suggested changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=728)|
| 0:12:14| In an October 2011 update, they found that immigration had not responded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=734)|
| 0:12:20| to their recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=740)|
| 0:12:22| This program is being phased out across the country and will not be expanded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=742)|
| 0:12:29| except possibly to a county in South Carolina and Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=749)|
| 0:12:34| because the petition was introduced in 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=754)|
| 0:12:39| Why would we want to implement a program that has failed, created chaos,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=759)|
| 0:12:45| and is now being phased out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=765)|
| 0:12:48| A reformed alcoholic goes to talk to high schoolers to tell them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=768)|
| 0:12:52| I am here, so you do not make the same mistakes I made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=772)|
| 0:12:56| Can we learn from others' mistakes and not implement this program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=776)|
| 0:13:01| even if we had asked for it before the evaluations were in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=781)|
| 0:13:06| The main concerns are reduced cooperation of witnesses and victims of crime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=786)|
| 0:13:11| reduced public safety to all of us, increased victimization and exploitation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=791)|
| 0:13:17| possibility of law enforcement misconduct, impact on law enforcement budgets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=797)|
| 0:13:24| and resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=804)|
| 0:13:26| We would be paying the salary of an officer performing immigration duties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=806)|
| 0:13:30| during his working hours as a sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=810)|
| 0:13:34| A high possibility of error, given the complexity of immigration law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=814)|
| 0:13:39| and racial profiling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=819)|
| 0:13:41| I asked a sheriff from a neighboring county the reason why he stopped a Hispanic male.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=821)|
| 0:13:47| He looked at his file and said, because he did not have a driver's license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=827)|
| 0:13:52| So I asked him, how did he know he did not have a driver's license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=832)|
| 0:13:58| He looked at me for a while, and then he said, he looked suspicious to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=838)|
| 0:14:03| Let's illustrate the effects of this law with one example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=843)|
| 0:14:07| A couple has four children with two U.S. born.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=847)|
| 0:14:11| The parents go to buy groceries, and they are stopped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=851)|
| 0:14:14| He's driving without a license, because we will not issue a driver's license without a visa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=854)|
| 0:14:19| So they're both taken to jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=859)|
| 0:14:22| They do not have any criminal record and are not a threat to anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=862)|
| 0:14:27| They are placed in deportation proceedings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=867)|
| 0:14:29| He is kept there, and the mother is released and has to appear in front of a judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=869)|
| 0:14:34| What happens now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=874)|
| 0:14:36| Split families apart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=876)|
| 0:14:38| The father is in jail, awaiting deportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=878)|
| 0:14:41| The mother is a stay-at-home mom, like Anne Romney or perhaps myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=881)|
| 0:14:45| who chose and were able to stay home with our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=885)|
| 0:14:49| She is desperate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=889)|
| 0:14:50| Now what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=890)|
| 0:14:52| The electricity bill arrives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=892)|
| 0:14:53| Who is going to pay for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=893)|
| 0:14:55| The mortgage bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=895)|
| 0:14:56| A possible foreclosure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=896)|
| 0:14:58| Car payment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=898)|
| 0:14:59| The mother goes in front of a judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=899)|
| 0:15:01| She can be ordered deported as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=901)|
| 0:15:04| So what happens to the kids?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=904)|

| 0:15:18| Do they stay here in state custody, placed in a foster home?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=918)|
| 0:15:23| Will they stay together?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=923)|
| 0:15:25| Will they be treated differently because only two of them are U.S. citizens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=925)|
| 0:15:29| Will they go to the same school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=929)|
| 0:15:31| What will happen to their health?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=931)|
| 0:15:33| You see the chaos?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=933)|
| 0:15:35| And this is just one family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=935)|
| 0:15:37| And who will be paying for all this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=937)|
| 0:15:39| We will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=939)|
| 0:15:41| All of us here probably agree that we need to do something about immigration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=941)|
| 0:15:46| but 287G would bring more chaos than solutions to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=946)|
| 0:15:52| Regarding immigration, I hear people talking about cutting in line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=952)|
| 0:15:56| If a person came here without a permit, there is no line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=956)|
| 0:16:01| You know, if I were a U.S. citizen who wants to bring my unmarried children who are in Mexico,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=961)|
| 0:16:08| immigration is currently reviewing the petitions that were filed May 15, 1993, 19 years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=968)|
| 0:16:19| if I want to bring my children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=979)|
| 0:16:21| Your time is just about up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=981)|
| 0:16:22| We do have to reform immigration, but 287G is not the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=982)|
| 0:16:26| It's not efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=986)|
| 0:16:27| We'll bring more expenses, racial profiling, and chaos to our country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=987)|
| 0:16:31| This is why I respectfully request of you, do not fund 287G.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=991)|
| 0:16:36| I would like our money to go toward education and technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=996)|
| 0:16:39| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=999)|
| 0:16:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1000)|
| 0:16:41| We appreciate your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1001)|
| 0:16:43| We have now Daniel Snyder, who has asked to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1003)|
| 0:16:48| Yes, if you'd give us your address for the record, please, and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1008)|
| 0:16:53| My name is Daniel Snyder, and my address is 2900 Scottish Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1013)|
| 0:17:00| I'm here to talk about 287G, and I think that Janine just gave a really good persuasive argument| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1020)|
| 0:17:10| about why for the people affected, we don't directly affected by the program, we don't need 287G.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1030)|
| 0:17:18| But I'm concerned about the accountability and oversight that Knox County as taxpayers have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1038)|
| 0:17:26| for this program that is likely to funnel millions of dollars away from more needed priorities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1046)|
| 0:17:35| that we have set for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1055)|
| 0:17:38| A group of us, when we learned about 287G, went to the sheriff, have gone to the sheriff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1058)|
| 0:17:45| and are continuing to try and schedule meetings with the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1065)|
| 0:17:49| And we've been completely turned away every time stonewalled by his office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1069)|
| 0:17:56| So whenever I think of Knox County, I think that if I'm paying tax dollars, if I'm helping to pay property rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1076)|
| 0:18:06| that I should have a say, that the people who are paying in should have a say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1086)|
| 0:18:11| And I don't see the accountability and oversight in this program as it stands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1091)|
| 0:18:17| What we do know about this program is that ICE, which is Immigration and Customs Enforcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1097)|
| 0:18:24| is willing to pay for the training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1104)|
| 0:18:28| But then Knox County of the officers to become Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1108)|
| 0:18:34| But after that, we pay for the corrections facility bills for the people who are brought in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1114)|
| 0:18:42| We pay for the transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1122)|
| 0:18:45| We pay whenever there's a county-level abuse by a sheriff's officer or a city police officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1125)|
| 0:18:52| who put up litigation against Knox County for discrimination or any other kind of abuse that's been well-documented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1132)|
| 0:19:02| 287G is a failing policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1142)|
| 0:19:06| The Obama administration has said that they want to decrease the funding for this agreement by 25 percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1146)|
| 0:19:14| which would fit Knox County with the bill even more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1154)|
| 0:19:21| This program has got no oversight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1161)|
| 0:19:25| It's only beholden to Sheriff Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1165)|
| 0:19:29| There is no input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1169)|
| 0:19:32| And as a group of concerned citizens, to be told repeatedly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1172)|
| 0:19:36| No, we won't listen to your concerns. No, we won't listen to your concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1176)|
| 0:19:40| It's a little frustrating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1180)|
| 0:19:42| And I want to come to you all and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1182)|
| 0:19:47| Why do we want this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1187)|
| 0:19:50| Why would we let the sheriff do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1190)|
| 0:19:53| Is this where we want Knox County to be going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1193)|
| 0:19:56| Given the Supreme Court's decision on SB 1070,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1196)|
| 0:20:00| wherever you stand on what they said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1200)|
| 0:20:04| our country is going to be more and more accessible for more and more people to make a living,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1204)|
| 0:20:12| to be able to provide for their own and to have the safety and the cooperation from their community to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1212)|
| 0:20:19| And 287G for Knox County stands as a huge roadblock for that kind of progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1219)|
| 0:20:25| And you all are responsible for passing the sheriff's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1225)|
| 0:20:30| You all are responsible for allocating the monies as they're used in this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1230)|
| 0:20:35| And I want to have a serious conversation with the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1235)|
| 0:20:39| I want to have a serious conversation with you all and everyone involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1239)|
| 0:20:45| about why we want 287G or why we don't want 287G in this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1245)|
| 0:20:51| And I come before you all to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1251)|
| 0:20:55| Can we turn this into an agenda item for next month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1255)|
| 0:20:59| Can we talk about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1259)|
| 0:21:01| Can we talk about the numbers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1261)|
| 0:21:03| Can we talk about how much this is going to cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1263)|
| 0:21:05| Can we talk about why he's asking for it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1265)|
| 0:21:07| Can we talk about all of these things that we're just running into a wall trying to get at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1267)|
| 0:21:14| So that's the end of my comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1274)|
| 0:21:18| That's the end of my comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1278)|
| 0:21:19| I see that we have a light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1279)|
| 0:21:22| Commissioner Norman, did you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1282)|
| 0:21:23| There's a light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1283)|
| 0:21:24| I didn't know if this was before Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1284)|
| 0:21:27| Just inadvertent light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1287)|
| 0:21:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1288)|
| 0:21:29| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1289)|
| 0:21:31| Yes, I've spoken with several people in this group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1291)|
| 0:21:34| and I've also met with Sheriff Jones about this issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1294)|
| 0:21:39| and can say that there has been effort on his part to create a community liaison group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1299)|
| 0:21:50| and some local ministers who are part of the local Hispanic community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1310)|
| 0:21:58| to help with some communication issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1318)|
| 0:22:01| And, unfortunately, I've not had a chance to speak with him in the last couple weeks about how that's going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1321)|
| 0:22:06| But I do know that one of the reasons that there's not been a meeting yet is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1326)|
| 0:22:11| because he hasn't gotten a clear statement yet from ICE about what this is going to entail for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1331)|
| 0:22:25| And I think he was hoping to wait until he had that before there was a question and answer meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1345)|
| 0:22:31| But I'm going to talk to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1351)|
| 0:22:32| He's, unfortunately, out of town today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1352)|
| 0:22:34| But I'm going to talk to him when he gets back about just having a sit-down-and-listening type of meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1354)|
| 0:22:40| And I think there's just a lot of, because this has not gone well in other counties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1360)|
| 0:22:47| there's a lot of anxiety about what might happen here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1367)|
| 0:22:51| And I do know that what they're thinking about here in Knox County is different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1371)|
| 0:22:56| from the way it's been implemented in other areas where it's failed miserably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1376)|
| 0:23:01| I'm not saying that I'm for this or against this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1381)|
| 0:23:04| I'm just saying I'm trying to facilitate conversation between the two sides and to learn more about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1384)|
| 0:23:11| And so I would like to add this as a discussion item to next month's agenda so that we can all hear more about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1391)|
| 0:23:19| and have a fuller discussion and have some of these questions hopefully answered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1399)|
| 0:23:24| so that everyone will feel more comfortable with where we are in the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1404)|
| 0:23:28| and what might or might not happen moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1408)|
| 0:23:32| So I'd like to add that for next month if that's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1412)|
| 0:23:36| Jolie, if you'd make sure that that's added as a discussion item next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1416)|
| 0:23:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1420)|
| 0:23:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1422)|
| 0:23:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1423)|
| 0:23:44| We are now ready to go into regular session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1424)|
| 0:23:46| We've had a couple of people that want to talk about roundabouts and another item on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1426)|
| 0:23:50| We're going to get to that very quickly because most of our items are on consent today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1430)|
| 0:23:55| So I need to call us into order for our regular session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1435)|

| 0:24:21| Ten members present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1461)|
| 0:24:22| Our devotional this month is conducted by Commissioner Larry Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1462)|
| 0:24:23| Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1463)|
| 0:24:24| I asked Coach Conzo Martin to come give our invocation for us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1464)|
| 0:24:28| You see him out in the crowd?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1468)|
| 0:24:30| I don't see Conzo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1470)|
| 0:24:31| Then I tried Skyler McBee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1471)|
| 0:24:33| Skyler did not want to come, but that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1473)|
| 0:24:37| I'm hoping this is not our last prayer for our county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1477)|
| 0:24:40| Let's go to the Lord in prayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1480)|
| 0:24:42| I'll be praying from a Christian perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1482)|

| 0:24:53| We thank you for our country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1493)|
| 0:24:55| We thank you for our Congress and Senate that we have, and they start their days with prayer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1495)|
| 0:24:59| and we want to do the same thing here, start our day with prayer and honor you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1499)|
| 0:25:05| I pray for all the employees that we have here that do such a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1505)|
| 0:25:10| I ask that you just bless them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1510)|
| 0:25:12| I ask that you bless the office holders that represent and keep their hearts pure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1512)|
| 0:25:17| I pray that you'll be with us today in decisions that we make as commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1517)|
| 0:25:21| how we can better put this community forward and do your will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1521)|
| 0:25:25| In the name we pray, amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1525)|
| 0:25:27| The pledge of the flag will now be conducted by Commissioner Richard Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1527)|
| 0:25:31| Please stand and salute the flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1531)|
| 0:25:34| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1534)|
| 0:25:39| and to the Republic for which it stands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1539)|
| 0:25:42| one nation under God, indivisible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1542)|
| 0:25:45| with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1545)|
| 0:25:51| Next is the approval of minutes to the previous meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1551)|
| 0:25:53| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1553)|
| 0:25:55| I'd like to make a motion to approve with an amendment to the amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1555)|
| 0:25:59| During the discussion for the budget last month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1559)|
| 0:26:01| there was a conversation between myself, McKenzie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1561)|
| 0:26:06| and Chairman Hammond where we had some questions about maintenance of effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1566)|
| 0:26:11| And so in our amendments on page two of our minutes, I'm sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1571)|
| 0:26:18| amendment number one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1578)|
| 0:26:19| it says three million maintenance of effort already committed by the mayor from early literacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1579)|
| 0:26:23| That cannot be and it was not put into maintenance of effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1583)|
| 0:26:27| So I'd like to strike that from the minutes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1587)|
| 0:26:30| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1590)|
| 0:26:31| Motion to be made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1591)|
| 0:26:32| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1592)|
| 0:26:34| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1594)|
| 0:26:35| They are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1595)|
| 0:26:36| Are there amendments to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1596)|
| 0:26:38| I have an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1598)|
| 0:26:40| I'd like to add resolution number 909.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1600)|
| 0:26:44| The county mayor's office is asking that number 910 be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1604)|
| 0:26:51| That's about the Tourism and Sports Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1611)|
| 0:26:53| I'd also like to pull from consent the item about the roundabout at Bob Gray Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1613)|
| 0:27:00| We have some folks that have asked to speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1620)|
| 0:27:02| We want to give them the opportunity to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1622)|
| 0:27:04| Mr. Snowden, do you have something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1624)|
| 0:27:06| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1626)|
| 0:27:07| Jim Snowden, 205 West Baxter Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1627)|
| 0:27:09| I'd like to pull or defer item 405, the Bob Gray roundabouts, for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1629)|
| 0:27:14| I spoke to the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1634)|
| 0:27:15| He'd like to get with the folks that have the concerns and try to resolve those concerns prior to you all voting on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1635)|
| 0:27:22| So if anyone here has concerns, they can get with me in the back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1642)|
| 0:27:25| and I'll be more than happy to get their name and make sure they're included with that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1645)|
| 0:27:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1649)|
| 0:27:30| We do have some people who have signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1650)|
| 0:27:32| I feel that we need to give them an opportunity to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1652)|
| 0:27:34| but we'll go ahead and put on the agenda to defer for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1654)|
| 0:27:37| But for folks who have made the effort to come down, we will give them that chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1657)|
| 0:27:41| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1661)|
| 0:27:42| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1662)|
| 0:27:44| Could we put for a discussion item the Chamber of Commerce,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1664)|
| 0:27:50| a brief discussion about the Chamber and their expense statements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1670)|
| 0:27:56| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1676)|
| 0:27:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1677)|
| 0:27:58| And then also, do we have for schools consent on item 204?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1678)|
| 0:28:04| Is that still consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1684)|
| 0:28:05| Are we going to discuss that at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1685)|
| 0:28:07| Per our agreement, all school items were to be discussed during the workshop session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1687)|
| 0:28:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1694)|
| 0:28:15| So we can't really take that up again now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1695)|
| 0:28:19| That's according to our agreement, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1699)|
| 0:28:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1700)|
| 0:28:21| And 407?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1701)|
| 0:28:25| 407 is on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1705)|
| 0:28:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1707)|
| 0:28:28| That's a school item, too, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1708)|
| 0:28:29| No, it's engineering and public works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1709)|
| 0:28:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1711)|
| 0:28:32| Could I just – let's remove 407.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1712)|
| 0:28:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1714)|
| 0:28:35| So noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1715)|
| 0:28:36| 508, just a brief question about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1716)|
| 0:28:43| That's a community development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1723)|
| 0:28:47| Yes, we'll pull that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1727)|
| 0:28:49| 601, is that on consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1729)|
| 0:28:54| It is on consent, but we can remove it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1734)|
| 0:28:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1737)|
| 0:28:58| So 601.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1738)|
| 0:28:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1739)|
| 0:29:00| And then 908, the resolution, which was about the survey, which I think was discussed in the luncheon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1740)|
| 0:29:08| Are we still – is that still?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1748)|
| 0:29:10| Yes, the survey, we're asking that that be deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1750)|
| 0:29:12| I'm going to ask that that be deferred for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1752)|
| 0:29:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1754)|
| 0:29:15| Could we move that to a discussion item then, just for those of us that did not hear what was talked about during that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1755)|
| 0:29:24| Sure, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1764)|
| 0:29:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1765)|
| 0:29:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1766)|
| 0:29:27| Commissioner Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1767)|
| 0:29:28| I'm going to just put it in the form of a motion to approve or to add 802.126-802.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1768)|
| 0:29:36| It's on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1776)|
| 0:29:42| Is there anything else that needs to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1782)|
| 0:29:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1783)|
| 0:29:47| Mr. Chairperson, David Draper, 620 Market Street, Louis King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1787)|
| 0:29:51| This is actually a rezone, and I hear – I know you hear those at 6 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1791)|
| 0:29:55| I wanted to state – I want to request a postponement because I may not make it back here from a doctor's appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1795)|
| 0:30:04| We are requesting a postponement because Mr. King, who is this applicant's attorney,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1804)|
| 0:30:11| in reality is recovering and about close to getting back in the swing of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1811)|
| 0:30:17| There are all of the opponents that we know of, to the extent there are any,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1817)|
| 0:30:22| on notice of our request for a postponement, a 30-day postponement today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1822)|
| 0:30:27| So this is item 59 on the rezone, and I realize this convenes at 6, but because I may not make it back here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1827)|
| 0:30:36| I wanted to make our position now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1836)|
| 0:30:39| So you're asking that that be postponed indefinitely or for 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1839)|
| 0:30:41| 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1841)|
| 0:30:42| 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1842)|
| 0:30:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1843)|
| 0:30:45| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1845)|
| 0:30:46| I'm going to speak in support of what Mr. Draper just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1846)|
| 0:30:50| I talked to him over the weekend, and I notified as many people as I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1850)|
| 0:30:54| I was going to do the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1854)|
| 0:30:56| All I was going to say was I was going to – we'll carry that motion to the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1856)|
| 0:31:01| Well, what I mean – okay, I mean, but what I've done is I've notified as many people that have contacted me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1861)|
| 0:31:06| since this is in my district about this, and I told them not to come tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1866)|
| 0:31:10| because what I didn't want them to do is come down here and pay $8 to park, sit here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1870)|
| 0:31:13| and then find out it's been deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1873)|
| 0:31:15| So I think it would be unfair to hear it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1875)|
| 0:31:19| One, the attorney's not here, and the second thing, the people that there is opposition to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1879)|
| 0:31:23| they're not going to be here either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1883)|
| 0:31:25| We phoned, mailed, emailed, and however else you can try to contact people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1885)|
| 0:31:32| we did all those things to everybody we know that has voiced any concern to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1892)|
| 0:31:37| whose identity we know, and that was, I think, three or four people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1897)|
| 0:31:43| So do I have a motion that we add what needs to be added and deferred what needs to be deferred or withdraw?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1903)|
| 0:31:48| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1908)|
| 0:31:49| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1909)|
| 0:31:51| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1911)|
| 0:31:52| The agenda is set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1912)|
| 0:31:53| Stand by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1913)|
| 0:31:54| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1914)|
| 0:31:55| Did you have something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1915)|
| 0:31:56| What are we doing with this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1916)|
| 0:31:58| We're going to defer it for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1918)|
| 0:32:00| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=1920)|

| 0:44:04| Could you read those again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=2644)|

| 0:44:15| Commissioners, if you don't object, we are going to defer the Bob Gray roundabout for 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=2655)|
| 0:44:20| but we do have some folks who have signed up to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=2660)|
| 0:44:22| and I'd like to recognize them now because we want to make sure that you have an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=2662)|
| 0:44:26| to address us just in case you can't come in 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=2666)|
| 0:44:29| Is Norman Shaw here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=2669)|
| 0:44:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=2671)|
| 0:44:32| If you would give us your address for the record, Mr. Shaw, and you will have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=2672)|
| 0:44:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=2676)|
| 0:44:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=2677)|
| 0:44:38| My name is Norman Shaw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=2678)|
| 0:44:39| My address is 1120 Winding Way Drive in Knoxville, 37923.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=2679)|
| 0:44:45| I'm a retired title attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=2685)|
| 0:44:47| I spent most of my career, all of my career, here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=2687)|
| 0:44:51| And we built a new house in Pine Ridge Crossing about 22 years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=2691)|
| 0:44:55| and have lived there for that entire time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=2695)|
| 0:44:58| So we turned into our subdivision off Bob Gray| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=2698)|
| 0:45:00| and have been up and down Bob Gray numerous times over the last 22 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=2700)|
| 0:45:05| Really, there's a lot of people that oppose the plan that's in place here to build these two roundabouts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=2705)|
| 0:45:10| It may not seem like it today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=2710)|
| 0:45:12| There's only three or four here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=2712)|
| 0:45:14| But I think we allowed ourselves to be lulled into complacency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=2714)|
| 0:45:18| because as we drive up and down the road, we notice all the stakes and all the yards disappeared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=2718)|
| 0:45:22| And then we've noticed there's no activity this summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=2722)|
| 0:45:25| When there was a public meeting last October at the Cedar Bluff Library,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=2725)|
| 0:45:29| we were told that this project would definitely be done by the end of the summer to get ready for the school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=2729)|
| 0:45:34| We saw no activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=2734)|
| 0:45:35| And shame on us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=2735)|
| 0:45:36| We kind of let the thing go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=2736)|
| 0:45:38| And I should have contacted Mr. Snowden maybe a month or two ago to see what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=2738)|
| 0:45:43| Fortunately, one of the people that's going to speak today did check the Internet over the weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=2743)|
| 0:45:48| We found out there's a vote today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=2748)|
| 0:45:50| So if we come back in 30 days, I think you'll see a lot more people here opposing this proposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=2750)|
| 0:45:55| I agree we need to do something, but we do need to reduce the speed at these two intersections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=2755)|
| 0:46:02| The problem is to approach these intersections on this county road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=2762)|
| 0:46:06| you basically come down a hill each direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=2766)|
| 0:46:09| And most people that are prudent slow down, but some people don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=2769)|
| 0:46:13| And that's what causes the accidents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=2773)|
| 0:46:15| But there's really not as many accidents there as you would think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=2775)|
| 0:46:20| And we'll probably get into that later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=2780)|
| 0:46:22| According to the statistics we saw given to us, there's only about three per year at these intersections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=2782)|
| 0:46:29| which to me is a very light number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=2789)|
| 0:46:32| So we need to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=2792)|
| 0:46:34| I disagree with the approach that's being taken with these two roundtables.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=2794)|
| 0:46:37| I think it's definitely an overkill of the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=2797)|
| 0:46:40| I think it's a waste of county money, public money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=2800)|
| 0:46:44| The proposal was $800,000 back in October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=2804)|
| 0:46:47| It's now gone up to a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=2807)|
| 0:46:49| And nothing's been done, but the price has already gone up $200,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=2809)|
| 0:46:55| I feel like it definitely you build two large concrete roundabouts within half a mile of each other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=2815)|
| 0:47:02| I just don't think you can do that for a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=2822)|
| 0:47:04| I hope it's not done at all, but if it goes through, I don't think you can do it for a million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=2824)|
| 0:47:08| I think it would take more like two million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=2828)|
| 0:47:10| And I base that on the fact that the intersection of Concord and North Shore, there's a roundabout there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=2830)|
| 0:47:19| as you probably know, and that cost $900,000 several years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=2839)|
| 0:47:23| So how are you going to build two on the same road for a million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=2843)|
| 0:47:27| So I just think it's very appropriate for these reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=2847)|
| 0:47:29| And I was going to say, I think if the mayor, this comes out of the mayor's capital improvements budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=2849)|
| 0:47:34| and I was going to say if he knew the details, I think he'd be against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=2854)|
| 0:47:38| I think we've had an indication of that today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=2858)|
| 0:47:40| He wants to look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=2860)|
| 0:47:41| He didn't know the details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=2861)|
| 0:47:43| He can't know the entire budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=2863)|
| 0:47:45| So he was sent some e-mails over the weekend and a phone call this morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=2865)|
| 0:47:50| and I think he's seen that this does need to have more review, and he's going to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=2870)|
| 0:47:55| And we hope to meet with him and help educate him, along with his staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=2875)|
| 0:47:59| about what's going on there over the next 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=2879)|
| 0:48:04| So I was really glad to hear the postponement for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=2884)|
| 0:48:10| What was presented to you today, which if it's presented in 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=2890)|
| 0:48:13| will be a right-of-way issue to approve the purchasing of the right-of-ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=2893)|
| 0:48:17| I think because of the opposition in this area, I think there's nine parcels at each intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=2897)|
| 0:48:23| That's 18 parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=2903)|
| 0:48:24| I think a lot of these owners are going to oppose selling them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=2904)|
| 0:48:27| And if that happens, then you're going to have to go to the condemnation process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=2907)|
| 0:48:31| which will throw it to Chancery Court, and you're going to run into extra costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=2911)|
| 0:48:35| legal costs, and it's going to be more time-consuming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=2915)|
| 0:48:38| So I think you need to take that consideration if this comes back up for you in 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=2918)|
| 0:48:43| of trying to or obviously going to try to purchase the property at fair market value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=2923)|
| 0:48:48| But if you don't have a willing seller, you've got to go through the condemnation process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=2928)|
| 0:48:53| So I was going to recommend a postponement, but that's already happened, so I'm excited about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=2933)|
| 0:48:59| And I think the solution to the problem is simply to have signs that are posted at a lower speed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=2939)|
| 0:49:07| with flashing lights, much like what you see in a school zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=2947)|
| 0:49:10| Who doesn't go through a school zone with flashing lights and doesn't slow down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=2950)|
| 0:49:14| Of course, you know there might be a policeman there going to give you a ticket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=2954)|
| 0:49:17| So, but it's just a natural response to see a sign on the side of the road flashing slow down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=2957)|
| 0:49:22| And there's a very similar situation at the intersection of Ball Road and Oak Ridge Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=2962)|
| 0:49:28| If you're familiar with that intersection, there's a blind curve there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=2968)|
| 0:49:31| They installed a red light a few years ago, so the tractor backs up the red light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=2971)|
| 0:49:36| Because of the blind curve, they put exactly that in a few years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=2976)|
| 0:49:40| And I occasionally go up that road, and if I'm not thinking about the blind curve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=2980)|
| 0:49:44| and I see that flashing sign, I immediately slow down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=2984)|
| 0:49:47| See, it works on me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=2987)|
| 0:49:48| So I've got to believe it will work on the people on Ball Gray Road that approach these two intersections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=2988)|
| 0:49:53| So I'm almost at time on the button there, so I thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=2993)|
| 0:49:57| Thank you, sir. We appreciate your being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=2997)|

| 0:50:06| And if you would give us your address for the record, and you will have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3006)|
| 0:50:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3009)|

| 0:50:18| for those who are familiar with the Bob Gray and Mabry Hood slash Hickey intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3018)|
| 0:50:25| I'd like to thank all of you for listening to our concerns today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3025)|
| 0:50:28| I would also like to thank Jim Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3028)|
| 0:50:30| He's been very gracious to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3030)|
| 0:50:32| This has been almost a year that several of us have been involved in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3032)|
| 0:50:36| He's been very transparent, as has his team, with the projected changes to those intersections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3036)|
| 0:50:44| And I believe he made a very common-sense, logical decision in asking for this to be deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3044)|
| 0:50:50| When I arrived today, my plan was to not ask for this decision to be deferred,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3050)|
| 0:50:55| but to ask for this to be canceled entirely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3055)|
| 0:50:58| You've heard from one of my colleagues so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3058)|
| 0:51:01| Several of you may have read the coverage in Sandra's publication to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3061)|
| 0:51:07| As Norman Shaw stated, this is a very expensive proposal that we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3067)|
| 0:51:13| This proposal enjoys very little, if any, public support that we've been able to identify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3073)|
| 0:51:20| I personally have been to two of the public meetings with Mr. Snowden and his group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3080)|
| 0:51:26| Dwight Vandivate was at the second meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3086)|
| 0:51:29| And I'd say there were about 60 people at the last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3089)|
| 0:51:33| Between the first meeting and the last meeting, or the second meeting, things got pretty heated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3093)|
| 0:51:38| I think everyone who was there would agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3098)|
| 0:51:41| I have to say that that was not because this is a proposal that enjoys support of the people in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3101)|
| 0:51:48| I haven't looked at census numbers for the areas we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3108)|
| 0:51:52| I know some of you travel those roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3112)|
| 0:51:54| I've seen you out in our area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3114)|
| 0:51:57| I have to say that we're talking about thousands of homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3117)|
| 0:52:01| I don't know if we're talking about 5,000 or 10,000, but it's many people that will be impacted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3121)|
| 0:52:07| As I said, you don't see a lot of people behind us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3127)|
| 0:52:11| We won't go into all the reasons for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3131)|
| 0:52:13| But as of last night, word was getting out that this was happening today at this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3133)|
| 0:52:18| We have gotten no fewer than five responses, all negative, that we're happy to turn over to the appropriate commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3138)|
| 0:52:26| I wrote an e-mail yesterday to Commissioners Norman, Anders, Shouse, and Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3146)|
| 0:52:33| I hope you all got through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3153)|
| 0:52:34| I know it was very lengthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3154)|
| 0:52:36| It made several points that I believe are pertinent to the discussion of this geographic area that we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3156)|
| 0:52:44| If anyone was able to take the time to watch the WBIR story from June 18th, just last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3164)|
| 0:52:51| they even interviewed a gentleman who would be directly affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3171)|
| 0:52:54| He lives at the intersection of Maybury Hood Road with Bob Gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3174)|
| 0:52:59| While there is no doubt that these four properties that are directly impacted by these intersections could use some help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3179)|
| 0:53:08| I don't think anyone would deny those folks that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3188)|
| 0:53:11| Even the gentleman who has the property, who stands to benefit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3191)|
| 0:53:15| and who is willing to have some of his property acquired expressed serious doubt as to the viability of this proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3195)|
| 0:53:23| So I think when you listen to those who are closest to the situation, that bears listening, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3203)|
| 0:53:31| I'm really not sure who this proposal is designed to benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3211)|
| 0:53:35| We know it's expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3215)|
| 0:53:37| A million dollars today is a lot more than a million dollars a few years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3217)|
| 0:53:41| We know things are tight, and the residents of this area, I venture to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3221)|
| 0:53:47| would be happy to turn this million dollars back over to other higher priorities for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3227)|
| 0:53:52| The solution is speculative, as Mr. Shaw covered right before I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3232)|
| 0:53:57| And the solution is unpopular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3237)|
| 0:53:59| I'm not sure, when I hear some of the sentiments expressed about other proposals on this agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3239)|
| 0:54:05| why commission would not take seriously our concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3245)|
| 0:54:08| And I do hope today that you will and that you will hear us and confer among yourselves and in public with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3248)|
| 0:54:16| and let's see if we can get this project removed from the agenda entirely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3256)|
| 0:54:19| and those funds diverted to a higher priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3259)|
| 0:54:23| The problem we have is old-fashioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3263)|
| 0:54:25| It's old-fashioned speeding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3265)|
| 0:54:27| We've got a lot of DUI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3267)|
| 0:54:28| We've got people who have lived there who are very young and experienced drivers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3268)|
| 0:54:32| We've got seniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3272)|
| 0:54:34| We're talking about a solution that is high-tech for an old problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3274)|
| 0:54:38| I have concerns about the dangers of the new solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3278)|
| 0:54:42| I'm going to stop right there and ask everyone for your continued consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3282)|
| 0:54:46| We are willing to meet you in a month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3286)|
| 0:54:48| but I honestly hope that once you all and Mayor Burchett take a second look at what we're talking about here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3288)|
| 0:54:54| you'll pull the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3294)|
| 0:54:55| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3295)|
| 0:54:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3297)|
| 0:54:58| Cheryl Ludkey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3298)|
| 0:55:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3301)|
| 0:55:02| And if I didn't pronounce your name correctly, correct me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3302)|
| 0:55:05| You did a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3305)|
| 0:55:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3306)|
| 0:55:07| And if you give us your address, then you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3307)|
| 0:55:09| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3309)|
| 0:55:10| My name is Cheryl Ludkey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3310)|
| 0:55:11| I am a 25-year resident at 9716 Cortez Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3311)|
| 0:55:16| and I'm basically here to speak about the Bob Gray and Bob Kirby intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3316)|
| 0:55:23| My home is about a mile away from that intersection, and I use that intersection quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3323)|
| 0:55:30| One thing I'd like to encourage you is now that we have a 30-day delay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3330)|
| 0:55:35| I'd like to encourage you to try and make it out to Bob Gray Road and take a drive down Bob Gray Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3335)|
| 0:55:42| Bob Gray Road, for the number of homes and the amount of traffic that goes to Webb School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3342)|
| 0:55:49| Christian Academy, Tate School, Catholic, and all of the Cedar Bluff schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3349)|
| 0:55:55| is a cow path that we live off of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3355)|
| 0:55:59| It has no shoulders, and it has open ditches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3359)|
| 0:56:04| And when you start to think about putting in roundabouts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3364)|
| 0:56:10| it seems absurd to me that in the middle of the cow paths you're going to have roundabouts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3370)|
| 0:56:18| To paint a picture of the intersection that I'm most familiar with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3378)|
| 0:56:22| you have two steep entrances to Bob Gray Road from the north and south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3382)|
| 0:56:29| I don't know how many degrees they are in terms of their steepness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3389)|
| 0:56:33| but every time I've seen a roundabout, and all the ones that Cannon and Cannon spoke about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3393)|
| 0:56:38| they were on nice, flat spaces with a whole lot of room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3398)|
| 0:56:42| When Cannon and Cannon talked to us about this intersection in particular,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3402)|
| 0:56:47| they said that they weren't even going to be able to use a traditional roundabout structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3407)|
| 0:56:53| Traditionally, roundabouts come in at 90-degree angles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3413)|
| 0:56:56| and because of the lack of space there, they can't do 90-degree angles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3416)|
| 0:57:01| They have them skewing in such a way that you'll basically be able to head east and west on that road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3421)|
| 0:57:08| and barely be in the circular motion of a roundabout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3428)|
| 0:57:14| My property is not directly impacted, but I am here to speak for some of the residents in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3434)|
| 0:57:23| whose property is impacted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3443)|
| 0:57:25| There are about five condominiums on the west,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3445)|
| 0:57:29| that would be the southwest corner at Graywood Crossing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3449)|
| 0:57:33| and though the survey stakes are up to the people's back deck,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3453)|
| 0:57:39| there's not enough room there to put in a roundabout,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3459)|
| 0:57:44| and especially one that's going to be differently designed as the one a mile down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3464)|
| 0:57:50| You're going to have two different styles to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3470)|
| 0:57:53| I'm encouraging you to please visit our area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3473)|
| 0:57:56| and keep in mind when you get off at our exit and you come down from I-40,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3476)|
| 0:58:01| you're going to hit Executive Park Boulevard, where all the flooding is all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3481)|
| 0:58:07| We handle that, not perfectly, but we handle that major four-way intersection with four stop signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3487)|
| 0:58:15| and so we're asking you as residents in that area to deal with this situation logically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3495)|
| 0:58:21| We asked them in December, would they please try some stop signs first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3501)|
| 0:58:26| and nobody wanted to give anything other than this boondoggle a try,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3506)|
| 0:58:36| and once it's in, the money is spent, and the road is not improved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3516)|
| 0:58:41| You have two small pieces in the middle of a large section of road that have been improved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3521)|
| 0:58:46| and nothing else has been improved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3526)|
| 0:58:49| Thank you very, very much for your time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3529)|
| 0:58:51| and I look forward to speaking with you again in a month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3531)|
| 0:58:54| when you decide that we can use this money somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3534)|
| 0:58:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3538)|
| 0:58:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3539)|
| 0:59:00| Mr. Snowden, could I ask you a quick question, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3540)|
| 0:59:03| You had asked for a delay so that you could talk with or there could be discussion with the ñ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3543)|
| 0:59:09| are you planning a public meeting or any type of formal meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3549)|
| 0:59:12| If you do, would you please let Commission know in case we want to come?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3552)|
| 0:59:16| We haven't got into that detail, but we certainly can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3556)|
| 0:59:19| I mean, I think that's certainly probably the best thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3559)|
| 0:59:22| We did hold two public meetings about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3562)|
| 0:59:24| so we'll definitely let you know the location and place of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3564)|
| 0:59:28| If not, I would definitely like to meet you out there at some point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3568)|
| 0:59:31| perhaps other commissioners as well, just kind of go over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3571)|
| 0:59:33| I know exactly where the intersection is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3573)|
| 0:59:35| I used to live off Cedar Bluff, but I want to kind of refresh my memory on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3575)|
| 0:59:38| We'll do whatever we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3578)|
| 0:59:40| Anything else on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3580)|
| 0:59:41| Those are the people that I had signed up to speak on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3581)|
| 0:59:44| Was there anyone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3584)|
| 0:59:45| I want to make sure I didn't slide anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3585)|

| 0:59:48| Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3588)|
| 0:59:50| The next item is on page 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3590)|
| 0:59:52| It's Resolution 110.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3592)|
| 0:59:54| It is approving the appointments of individuals to serve as directors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3594)|
| 0:59:58| of the Industrial Development Board of the County of Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3598)|
| 1:00:01| and the Health, Educational, and Housing Facility Board of the County of Knox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3601)|
| 1:00:07| Commissioners, as you know, we had some folks attend our work session who were interested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3607)|
| 1:00:12| We have received their resumes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3612)|
| 1:00:15| We received additional resumes from candidates over the weekend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3615)|
| 1:00:20| or on Friday I believe it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3620)|
| 1:00:22| And so what we will do is we need to take them one at a time, each seat at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3622)|
| 1:00:30| And per our rules, we will see if any commissioner wants to nominate an individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3630)|
| 1:00:35| for that seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3635)|
| 1:00:38| We will then vote until we have a person who has received the majority of votes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3638)|
| 1:00:43| for that seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3643)|
| 1:00:45| So everyone, I know the commissioners are clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3645)|
| 1:00:48| I just want to make sure the folks in the audience are clear as to how we do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3648)|
| 1:00:51| So we will take them one seat at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3651)|
| 1:00:53| Each commissioner will have an opportunity to make a nomination,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3653)|
| 1:00:56| and we will vote on the nominations that are presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3656)|
| 1:00:59| So, clerk, let's start in the second district with Commissioner Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3659)|
| 1:01:03| Commissioner Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3663)|
| 1:01:05| I'd like to nominate Nicole Dawson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3665)|
| 1:01:11| Commissioner Broyles nominates Nicole Dawson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3671)|
| 1:01:14| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3674)|

| 1:01:20| Commissioner Owenby passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3680)|
| 1:01:21| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3681)|
| 1:01:22| I have a question about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3682)|
| 1:01:24| There's two resolutions here, 110 and 111.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3684)|
| 1:01:28| And are we going to vote on 111 separately?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3688)|
| 1:01:32| Yes, it will be voted on separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3692)|
| 1:01:33| They're replacing two other board members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3693)|
| 1:01:35| and their terms will be four years instead of whatever the normal term is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3695)|
| 1:01:39| So they're not part of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3699)|
| 1:01:40| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3700)|

| 1:01:58| Commissioner Schaus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3718)|
| 1:01:59| Question before I make a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3719)|
| 1:02:02| We had three or four individuals here a week ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3722)|
| 1:02:08| McWhorter and Robin Askew and another gentleman or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3728)|
| 1:02:14| Were they for this seat?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3734)|
| 1:02:16| Were they for the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3736)|
| 1:02:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3737)|
| 1:02:18| Ms. Askew is on resolution number 111.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3738)|
| 1:02:22| And so we'll be taking that up in the next resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3742)|
| 1:02:27| Okay, in the next one, not this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3747)|
| 1:02:28| But Mr. McWhorter is eligible for this seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3748)|
| 1:02:31| We have three, but, yes, if you want to place him in nomination, you can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3751)|
| 1:02:35| Is Mr. McWhorter also eligible for another seat?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3755)|
| 1:02:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3759)|
| 1:02:40| And Ms. Askew is not requesting this seat, but another seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3760)|
| 1:02:45| That's my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3765)|
| 1:02:46| Mr. Napier, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3766)|
| 1:02:48| She is under consideration for the seat under resolution 111.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3768)|
| 1:02:52| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3772)|
| 1:02:53| She was nominated by the Industrial Development Board for consideration to fill a vacancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3773)|
| 1:02:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3777)|
| 1:02:58| Okay, I'll nominate Greg McWhorter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3778)|
| 1:03:02| Commissioner Schaus nominates Greg McWhorter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3782)|
| 1:03:09| Yes, Commissioner Briggs, did you have something else you wanted to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3789)|
| 1:03:12| Oh, no, I hit that accidentally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3792)|
| 1:03:13| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3793)|
| 1:03:14| So two individuals have been placed in nomination for this, Nicole Dawson and Greg McWhorter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3794)|
| 1:03:19| So we will vote and we'll continue voting until one person receives a majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3799)|
| 1:03:27| Commissioner Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=3807)|

| 1:09:12| Mr. Crumley and Ed Kaur to complete the unfulfilled term of Jay Crippen, both having recently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4152)|
| 1:09:18| resigned from serving as directors of the Industrial Development Board of the County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4158)|
| 1:09:21| of Knox and the Health, Educational and Housing Facility Board of the County of Knox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4161)|
| 1:09:26| Do we have a motion, Commissioner Andrews?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4166)|
| 1:09:29| I have a question before I, can we, or Todd, explain to me what the Health, Education and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4169)|
| 1:09:37| Housing Facility Board does exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4177)|
| 1:09:42| I may ask Chris to jump in here if I miss anything as well, but primarily they're a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4182)|
| 1:09:46| conduit organization for bond financing for health care facilities, educational facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4186)|
| 1:09:54| that are not public institutions, obviously, and housing facilities that primarily benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4194)|
| 1:10:01| low and moderate income folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4201)|
| 1:10:03| Chris, anything else I should add to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4203)|
| 1:10:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4208)|
| 1:10:09| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4209)|
| 1:10:10| I would like to make a statement on Mr. Poore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4210)|
| 1:10:12| Mr. Poore has served very well for two terms, and I think the names that we've been given,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4212)|
| 1:10:21| you know, there's an ordinance that doesn't allow us to appoint somebody past two terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4221)|
| 1:10:28| unless there's nobody else that's qualified, and Mr. Poore is very qualified, but I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4228)|
| 1:10:33| there's also other people that have been submitted to us that are qualified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4233)|
| 1:10:37| So I would like to substitute Mr. Poore's name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4237)|
| 1:10:41| I guess I'm making, I struggle, I'll miss ask you as a dear friend, as she has always| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4241)|
| 1:10:50| treated me well, but the health and education, or the health and housing, the health bonds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4250)|
| 1:10:57| make me a little uncomfortable because of her husband's employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4257)|
| 1:11:06| But on Mr. Poore, we'll discuss, miss ask you, but on Mr. Poore, I'd like to replace him with Mr. McWhorter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4266)|
| 1:11:14| Let's do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4274)|
| 1:11:15| If it's okay with the commission, let's take them one at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4275)|
| 1:11:18| We have two individuals, so if we could take them each one at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4278)|
| 1:11:21| Is there any objection to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4281)|
| 1:11:23| Do I need to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4283)|
| 1:11:24| Are we not going to have nominations like we did with the others?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4284)|
| 1:11:28| Yeah, well, if you want to split them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4288)|
| 1:11:30| I mean, I just, Mr. Poore, I asked the law director and I agree with you on that one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4290)|
| 1:11:34| but I'm going to talk about, rather than putting two names in here and voting at the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4294)|
| 1:11:40| there may be other names for Rob and ask you, or for McWhorter in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4300)|
| 1:11:46| Sure, that's why I'm asking if we want to go ahead and split.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4306)|
| 1:11:48| I'll recommend that we go ahead and split, and procedurally, Mr. Law Director, do we need to make an amendment to split the two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4308)|
| 1:11:59| So do I have a motion that we split the two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4319)|
| 1:12:00| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4320)|
| 1:12:01| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4321)|
| 1:12:02| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4322)|
| 1:12:03| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4323)|
| 1:12:04| We will go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4324)|
| 1:12:05| So let's take the first one, the appointment of Rob and ask you to complete the unfulfilled term of Patricia Crumley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4325)|
| 1:12:10| So Rob and ask you's name has been placed in nomination,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4330)|
| 1:12:14| or would someone like to place their name in nomination, I guess I should say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4334)|
| 1:12:18| Yes, Commissioner Briggs is placed in nomination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4338)|
| 1:12:20| Are there other nominations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4340)|
| 1:12:22| Let's follow procedure and let's check with each commissioner to see if they have someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4342)|
| 1:12:26| Commissioner Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4346)|

| 1:12:38| Is it Wayne or Dwyane Setzer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4358)|
| 1:12:42| Commissioner Norman nominates Mr. Wayne Setzer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4362)|

| 1:13:06| Commissioner Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4386)|
| 1:13:07| Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4387)|

| 1:13:11| Commissioner Shouse passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4391)|
| 1:13:14| So two names are in nomination, Setzer and Askew, so we'll vote on those two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4394)|
| 1:13:18| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4398)|
| 1:13:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4399)|
| 1:13:20| Todd, I know you're not the expert in this, but there's not a lot of health and ed stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4400)|
| 1:13:27| going on, is there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4407)|
| 1:13:28| I don't recall one in recent memory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4408)|
| 1:13:31| We have ...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4411)|
| 1:13:32| Carter Elementary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4412)|
| 1:13:33| Was that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4413)|
| 1:13:34| No, that wouldn't have been ... That was run through the Industrial Development Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4414)|
| 1:13:39| It's pretty common.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4419)|
| 1:13:40| I would say at least four to six times a year we have an issue before us regarding bond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4420)|
| 1:13:46| financing before that board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4426)|
| 1:13:49| Could you give me an example?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4429)|
| 1:13:51| The expansion of Covenant Health would have been some recent ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4431)|
| 1:13:56| There was some private educational institutions, I guess Webb School, Johnson University, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4436)|
| 1:14:04| was Johnson Bible College, that were a couple recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4444)|
| 1:14:09| Some housing projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4449)|
| 1:14:10| I really can't call by name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4450)|
| 1:14:11| I don't think you would know them anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4451)|
| 1:14:13| So those are some examples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4453)|
| 1:14:15| Housing projects that wouldn't be ...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4455)|
| 1:14:16| It would be something like that, but a private small development, maybe 50 units, something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4456)|
| 1:14:23| like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4463)|
| 1:14:24| It wouldn't be a KCDC project typically, but ...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4464)|
| 1:14:27| It would be a non-profit ... Am I correct in saying a non-profit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4467)|
| 1:14:31| Would it be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4471)|
| 1:14:32| I mean ...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4472)|
| 1:14:33| No, it would be a for-profit organization that would be looking for bond financing to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4473)|
| 1:14:37| serve that market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4477)|
| 1:14:38| Is that correct, Chris?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4478)|
| 1:14:41| You want to clarify on ... Chris, and typically this really is more of a bond financing conduit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4481)|
| 1:14:47| type thing, and that's why I'm going to ask our attorney to answer this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4487)|
| 1:14:53| There's Trump 8703 Villacrest Road in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4493)|
| 1:14:58| Basically it's a conduit for various tax-exempt bonds as permitted by the IRS, and so the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4498)|
| 1:15:05| majority of them are 501c3 related bonds, but there are also other types such as public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4505)|
| 1:15:11| housing related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4511)|
| 1:15:13| So it does include educational, housing, and as well as the healthcare as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4513)|
| 1:15:22| Generally, most of them are educational and healthcare related with Covenant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4522)|
| 1:15:28| We've issued bonds for Baptist over the years, but more recently there's been some expansions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4528)|
| 1:15:33| of some of the non-profit schools as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4533)|
| 1:15:39| The issuer saves some money because it's tax-free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4539)|
| 1:15:43| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4543)|
| 1:15:44| They get a lower rate because they're a non-profit, and the recipient of the bond gets a tax-exempt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4544)|
| 1:15:51| pension on the interest that they receive on it, and so, therefore, they're willing to receive a lower rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4551)|
| 1:15:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4556)|
| 1:15:57| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4557)|
| 1:15:58| Commissioner Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4558)|
| 1:15:59| I just want to make a statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4559)|
| 1:16:00| I'm not questioning Ms. Askew's credentials, or I just don't want to put her in a position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4560)|
| 1:16:07| that could be a conflict of interest on a vote on the Industrial Development Board when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4567)|
| 1:16:12| it deals with healthcare facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4572)|
| 1:16:13| And I think that her character is, I don't question her character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4573)|
| 1:16:18| I just, the implication of it being there, I just don't want it to be there in my personal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4578)|
| 1:16:26| opinion, but I think she's qualified to sit on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4586)|
| 1:16:30| That's my only minor heartburn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4590)|
| 1:16:33| Yes, Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4593)|
| 1:16:36| I just wanted a little more on that, Mr. Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4596)|
| 1:16:40| Why is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4600)|
| 1:16:41| I don't understand the conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4601)|
| 1:16:42| Well, her husband's employed by Tenova.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4602)|
| 1:16:44| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4604)|
| 1:16:45| He's a government relations for Tenova.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=4605)|

| 1:26:31| It's an acronym.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5191)|

| 1:27:06| So this is for a PR campaign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5226)|
| 1:27:09| It went out for bid, and the money we used for that bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5229)|

| 1:27:47| I have to wait a little longer to see if we reduce pregnancies or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5267)|
| 1:27:51| It takes a little longer than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5271)|

| 1:28:49| It's something that HUD requires us to monitor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5329)|
| 1:28:53| and track the progress and the number of services we provide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5333)|
| 1:28:57| the number of people who are accessing services throughout the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5337)|
| 1:29:01| I don't have with me a lot of specific detail as to how the program is performing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5341)|
| 1:29:07| However, they are meeting their numbers on an annual basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5347)|
| 1:29:11| We monitor this contract annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5351)|
| 1:29:14| It's compliant with our regulations and HUD regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5354)|
| 1:29:20| and it's something we participate in partnership with the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5360)|
| 1:29:24| and other partners across the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5364)|
| 1:29:27| So all the providers of homeless services are cataloged into this information system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5367)|
| 1:29:33| and they share data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5373)|
| 1:29:35| Is that the way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5375)|
| 1:29:36| I mean, that's something that's taking place, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5376)|
| 1:29:39| Yeah, that's certainly the intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5379)|
| 1:29:41| I don't know if I could say categorically that every single provider in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5381)|
| 1:29:46| is plugged into the HMIS system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5386)|
| 1:29:49| but the large majority of providers are participating in the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5389)|
| 1:29:54| My other question was in terms of homeless services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5394)|
| 1:29:59| there's a lot of people that are not in the formal category of helping homeless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5399)|
| 1:30:06| but actually do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5406)|
| 1:30:09| Is there an attempt to include them in the service?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5409)|
| 1:30:13| Say, for example, a church who does benevolence work in the community, et cetera, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5413)|
| 1:30:21| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5421)|
| 1:30:22| I think that groups like the Compassion Coalition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5422)|
| 1:30:25| and there are various groups that do work to coordinate the services of churches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5425)|
| 1:30:33| and other smaller groups to make sure that there's not a duplication of services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5433)|
| 1:30:38| for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5438)|
| 1:30:39| That's often cited as an issue with duplication of services for homeless individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5439)|
| 1:30:44| An effort to mitigate that is through this HMIS program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5444)|
| 1:30:48| And again, more importantly, a lot of those providers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5448)|
| 1:30:51| those umbrella organizations like the Compassion Coalition and Homeless Coalition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5451)|
| 1:30:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5455)|
| 1:30:57| So the motion on the floor is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5457)|
| 1:30:59| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5459)|
| 1:31:00| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5460)|
| 1:31:01| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5461)|
| 1:31:02| The motion is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5462)|
| 1:31:03| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5463)|
| 1:31:04| The next item is on Page 15, Resolution 802.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5464)|
| 1:31:08| It's requesting the Metropolitan Planning Commission to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5468)|
| 1:31:11| and make a recommendation to the commission regarding a possible change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5471)|
| 1:31:15| to the Knox County Zoning Ordinance to conform to state law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5475)|
| 1:31:18| regarding who is responsible for the appointment of members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5478)|
| 1:31:21| to the Knox County Historic Zoning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5481)|
| 1:31:24| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5484)|
| 1:31:25| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5485)|
| 1:31:26| Director, would you weigh in on this and let us give us your thoughts on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5486)|
| 1:31:38| We're asking for a recommendation basically, but I'm just wondering what is the issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5498)|
| 1:31:43| Well, there has been a we had basically a disconnect between that which we had in our code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5503)|
| 1:31:48| and that which state law requires as to who actually is responsible for the appointment of members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5508)|
| 1:31:55| What we've done is crafted legislation that puts us in line with state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5515)|
| 1:32:02| The motion on the floor is to approve the request to NPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5522)|
| 1:32:05| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5525)|
| 1:32:06| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5526)|
| 1:32:07| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5527)|
| 1:32:08| The motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5528)|
| 1:32:09| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5529)|
| 1:32:10| Page 17, Resolution 907 is creating a task force designed to increase Knox County's share| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5530)|
| 1:32:14| of basic education program, BEP, monies allotted by the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5534)|
| 1:32:19| During the chairman's lunch today, we had Mr. Deakins and Mr. McIntyre there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5539)|
| 1:32:24| and we talked about the idea of creating this task force to basically lobby Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5544)|
| 1:32:30| the legislature, the governor, and the education commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5550)|
| 1:32:33| with regards to looking at getting more of the BEP money back into Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5553)|
| 1:32:37| We were successful in doing this two or three years ago, but we feel that we need to go even further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5557)|
| 1:32:41| and see if there are opportunities to secure even more dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5561)|
| 1:32:44| And so the idea was to have two members of the commission, two members of the school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5564)|
| 1:32:49| representatives of the mayor's office, also two private citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5569)|
| 1:32:52| one to be selected by the commission, one to be selected by the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5572)|
| 1:32:56| The schools are going to take that proposal to their meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5576)|
| 1:32:58| and so I'm asking that we approve that structure provided that the schools agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5578)|
| 1:33:07| So I'll make that in the form of a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5587)|
| 1:33:09| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5589)|
| 1:33:10| Motion's been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5590)|
| 1:33:11| Any comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5591)|
| 1:33:12| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5592)|
| 1:33:14| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5594)|
| 1:33:15| No, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5595)|
| 1:33:16| Was there some discussion of structure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5596)|
| 1:33:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5599)|
| 1:33:20| Well, the structure would be two commissioners, two school board members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5600)|
| 1:33:24| a representative from the mayor's office or the mayor, two private citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5604)|
| 1:33:28| one to be appointed by the commission, one to be appointed by the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5608)|
| 1:33:31| That was really fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5611)|
| 1:33:32| Could you say that again slowly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5612)|
| 1:33:34| It would be seven members total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5614)|
| 1:33:36| And, of course, anybody can participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5616)|
| 1:33:38| The law department would obviously be involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5618)|
| 1:33:40| but as far as having kind of a formal task force, two members of commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5620)|
| 1:33:44| two members of the school board, either the mayor or his representative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5624)|
| 1:33:50| and then two private citizens, one to be selected by the schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5630)|
| 1:33:55| and one to be selected by the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5635)|
| 1:33:58| And the school board will take that before their body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5638)|
| 1:34:00| and then they will see if that's acceptable to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5640)|
| 1:34:03| And if not, we'll come back and talk again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5643)|
| 1:34:06| So all those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5646)|
| 1:34:08| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5648)|
| 1:34:09| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5649)|
| 1:34:10| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5650)|
| 1:34:11| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5651)|
| 1:34:14| The next item is Resolution 909, which was added to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5654)|
| 1:34:20| It's establishing a policy regarding opening invocations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5660)|
| 1:34:24| before meetings of the Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5664)|
| 1:34:27| I'm going to ask that this be deferred for 30 days so it can go to the Rules Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5667)|
| 1:34:32| and have them to weigh in on it and come back to us with a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5672)|
| 1:34:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5677)|
| 1:34:39| Commissioner Brawls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5679)|
| 1:34:40| I think there was, I know of at least one person who is here to speak on this today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5680)|
| 1:34:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5685)|
| 1:34:46| So I'd like to give the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5686)|
| 1:34:47| Virginia, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5687)|
| 1:34:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5688)|
| 1:34:49| Virginia Douglas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5689)|
| 1:34:56| Ms. Douglas, thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5696)|
| 1:34:58| And you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5698)|
| 1:35:00| My name is Virginia Douglas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5700)|
| 1:35:02| I live at 918 Gratz Street, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5702)|
| 1:35:07| I want to speak on the issue of prayer before the meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5707)|
| 1:35:10| It's very important to many people, and it needs to be announced ahead of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5710)|
| 1:35:16| so that the public can speak and the Commission can study the legal aspects of this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5716)|
| 1:35:22| Please do not act upon this without further study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5722)|
| 1:35:25| And it's legally, it's very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5725)|
| 1:35:28| It's not something to do just on the cuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5728)|
| 1:35:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5731)|
| 1:35:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5733)|
| 1:35:35| Commissioner, do you have anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5735)|
| 1:35:38| I'm on the Rules Committee, and I agree that procedurally this is the correct way to handle it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5738)|
| 1:35:43| It needs to go through the Rules Committee before it comes to the full Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5743)|
| 1:35:46| But I think this is based on just feedback we've gotten today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5746)|
| 1:35:50| We've gotten several e-mails, and I'm sure there's going to be more e-mails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5750)|
| 1:35:54| and more people wanting to provide input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5754)|
| 1:35:58| I would like to suggest that we schedule a workshop on this specific issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5758)|
| 1:36:04| We could do it in conjunction with our workshop next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5764)|
| 1:36:07| We could have that on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5767)|
| 1:36:09| I look forward to having the people of Knox County tell us if they want us to pray before meetings or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5769)|
| 1:36:13| I welcome that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5773)|
| 1:36:15| So would that be appropriate to have that as our workshop next month rather than a separate workshop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5775)|
| 1:36:21| Fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5781)|
| 1:36:22| I don't know what size agenda we're looking at for next month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5782)|
| 1:36:25| but if it's a typical summer agenda, it's not going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5785)|
| 1:36:28| Yeah, we should have enough time to do it appropriately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5788)|
| 1:36:31| Okay, so we'll have that scheduled on our workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5791)|
| 1:36:33| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5793)|
| 1:36:34| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5794)|
| 1:36:37| I think we need to note, too, if you'll notice in the resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5797)|
| 1:36:40| that proposed resolution that you have before you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5800)|
| 1:36:44| we have a law director who dealt with this in previous circumstances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5804)|
| 1:36:49| who has it down to what it needs to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5809)|
| 1:36:53| So there doesn't need to be a whole lot of discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5813)|
| 1:36:56| And as far as who dictates this committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5816)|
| 1:37:00| this commission has the right to do what we want as far as procedures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5820)|
| 1:37:07| as long as we vote on it up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5827)|
| 1:37:09| This is not a public voting matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5829)|
| 1:37:14| We'll set it on for discussion, have a discussion at our next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5834)|
| 1:37:17| So I guess the motion on the floor is to send it to rules committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5837)|
| 1:37:23| And it's been seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5843)|
| 1:37:24| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5844)|
| 1:37:25| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5845)|
| 1:37:26| It is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5846)|
| 1:37:27| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5847)|
| 1:37:28| Resolution 910, which was added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5848)|
| 1:37:30| It is authorizing the Knox County mayor to execute an amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5850)|
| 1:37:34| to Knox County contract number 02-234 as amended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5854)|
| 1:37:38| with the Knoxville Tourism and Sports Corporation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5858)|
| 1:37:41| to extend the contract term through October 31, 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5861)|
| 1:37:44| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5864)|
| 1:37:46| For a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5866)|
| 1:37:47| Mr. Law Director, would you weigh in on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5867)|
| 1:37:48| and explain why we are adding this to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5868)|
| 1:37:57| And this is 907?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5877)|
| 1:37:58| KTSC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5878)|
| 1:37:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5879)|
| 1:38:00| In a nutshell, commissioners, as you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5880)|
| 1:38:04| last year prior to there having issues arisen with KTSC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5884)|
| 1:38:09| the commission, with the assent of KTSC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5889)|
| 1:38:13| entered into a six-year extension on the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5893)|
| 1:38:16| Subsequent to that, when issues arose that called into question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5896)|
| 1:38:19| some of the practices, the board, the KTSC board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5899)|
| 1:38:25| voted to essentially set aside the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5905)|
| 1:38:29| So where we are at this point, as of June,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5909)|
| 1:38:32| at the end of this month, our contract with them would expire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5912)|
| 1:38:36| which means there will be a gap in terms of the provision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5916)|
| 1:38:40| of any kind of tourism services or spending of tourism dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5920)|
| 1:38:43| Now, the city and the county are involved in a joint RFP process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5923)|
| 1:38:48| that will probably come to fruition on or about later in the fall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5928)|
| 1:38:52| around October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5932)|
| 1:38:54| So this is a stopgap measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5934)|
| 1:38:55| It extends the contract until October,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5935)|
| 1:38:58| until such time as the city and county can get together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5938)|
| 1:39:01| and have a joint RFP for the provision of tourism services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5941)|
| 1:39:06| So the motion on the floor is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5946)|
| 1:39:08| All those in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5948)|
| 1:39:10| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5950)|
| 1:39:11| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5951)|
| 1:39:12| The motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5952)|
| 1:39:13| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5953)|
| 1:39:15| The next item is discussion regarding the farmer's market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5955)|
| 1:39:18| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5958)|
| 1:39:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5960)|
| 1:39:21| David Vandergriff is here to discuss this item and bring it before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5961)|
| 1:39:26| Thank you, David.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5966)|
| 1:39:31| Thank you, commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5971)|
| 1:39:32| It won't take a lot of your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5972)|
| 1:39:34| I know you had a presentation a couple of months back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5974)|
| 1:39:37| from the Food Policy Council about farmer's markets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5977)|
| 1:39:40| There were a couple of things that came up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5980)|
| 1:39:42| and I wanted to address those as a UT Extension agent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5982)|
| 1:39:46| First, the two questions or two issues that were mentioned in the last discussion about those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5986)|
| 1:39:55| One was about should farmer's markets be supported?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5995)|
| 1:39:59| Was that a conflict with other policies about paying farmers not to grow things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=5999)|
| 1:40:04| There have been some direct payments made to farmers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6004)|
| 1:40:08| However, fruit and vegetable growers have never been a part of that program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6008)|
| 1:40:12| Those dealt with commodity crops, such as corn, wheat, soybeans, peanuts, and cotton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6012)|
| 1:40:18| And it's fairly much a certainty at this point that direct payments to farmers are going away anyway with the new farm bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6018)|
| 1:40:25| So, you know, there's no conflict with supporting farmer's markets with other things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6025)|
| 1:40:30| and certainly not with it's never been a part of paying farmers not to grow things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6030)|
| 1:40:37| The other issue that came up that Mr. Dickel and Ms. Welch didn't exactly know the answer to is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6037)|
| 1:40:44| is the farmer's market more expensive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6044)|
| 1:40:46| And the answer to that is no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6046)|
| 1:40:48| The farmer's markets are not a place necessarily for the cheapest food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6048)|
| 1:40:52| That's not what we try to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6052)|
| 1:40:54| It is absolutely the freshest food that you can buy anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6054)|
| 1:40:58| And it's very competitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6058)|
| 1:41:00| We have a lot of folks at the farmer's market that grow organic crops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6060)|
| 1:41:04| You know, if you go to Earth Fair or any place that sells organic products,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6064)|
| 1:41:07| those are more expensive than some of the others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6067)|
| 1:41:10| So, you know, price is really not an issue either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6070)|
| 1:41:15| Just like anywhere, there are some things that are a little cheaper, some things maybe slightly more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6075)|
| 1:41:20| These are folks that are trying to make a living from the farm, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6080)|
| 1:41:26| So, I wanted to clarify those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6086)|
| 1:41:30| Are there any questions about either of those two items before I make some other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6090)|
| 1:41:38| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6098)|
| 1:41:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6099)|
| 1:41:42| Next, I just want to talk to you not to duplicate what the Food Policy Council said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6102)|
| 1:41:47| because they had some really good information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6107)|
| 1:41:50| but reinforce what farmer's markets mean to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6110)|
| 1:41:56| Farmer's markets are part of the quality of life for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6116)|
| 1:42:00| And a lot of folks that come to visit, businesses that come to locate here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6120)|
| 1:42:04| they look for things like farmer's markets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6124)|
| 1:42:07| If you haven't visited one of our local farmer's markets, I would encourage you to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6127)|
| 1:42:12| They're a very vibrant activity, whether it's Market Square, New Harvest Park Farmer's Market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6132)|
| 1:42:20| any of the farmer's markets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6140)|
| 1:42:21| This year, they're doing pretty well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6141)|
| 1:42:24| Farmers tell me that their sales are up about 35 percent, which is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6144)|
| 1:42:31| Other things that farmer's markets mean to our community is it's not only residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6151)|
| 1:42:36| that come and shop at the farmer's markets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6156)|
| 1:42:38| We have some of our finer chefs in Knoxville that shop at the farmer's markets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6158)|
| 1:42:44| And you can go to restaurants and you'll see individual farmer's names on the menu| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6164)|
| 1:42:49| where they buy their products there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6169)|
| 1:42:52| I know I recently had guests in and we went to dinner with them at the Crown and Goose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6172)|
| 1:42:57| and that's one of our chefs that does that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6177)|
| 1:43:00| And the farmers from the farmer's markets name were prominently there in the menu.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6180)|
| 1:43:04| So, you know, it's part of our restaurant economy as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6184)|
| 1:43:10| Farms are something that's good for a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6190)|
| 1:43:14| And farms are actually a good value for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6194)|
| 1:43:19| This is a national figure from the American Farm Trust,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6199)|
| 1:43:22| but for each dollar of revenue versus expenditures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6202)|
| 1:43:28| farm, forest, and open land is $2.70 for each dollar that you invest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6208)|
| 1:43:33| So, there are positive returns to our community economically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6213)|
| 1:43:44| We have two farmer's markets that are different from the others in that we have two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6224)|
| 1:43:49| that participate in the SNAP program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6229)|
| 1:43:52| As you all are probably aware, SNAP is what used to be called food stamps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6232)|
| 1:43:57| And the two markets that participate in the SNAP program are the New Harvest Park Farmer's Market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6237)|
| 1:44:02| that's out of Knox County Parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6242)|
| 1:44:04| You all definitely have a vested interest in it, and Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6244)|
| 1:44:09| There's a national push to get more markets to be able to accept SNAP benefits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6249)|
| 1:44:16| and for those folks to be able to come and buy at the farmer's markets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6256)|
| 1:44:20| You know, if they're using their SNAP benefits at the farmer's market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6260)|
| 1:44:23| there is no junk food or any of that sort of thing they can buy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6263)|
| 1:44:27| Everything they buy is fresh fruits and vegetables because that's all we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6267)|
| 1:44:32| There is nothing else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6272)|
| 1:44:33| They can buy vegetable transplants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6273)|
| 1:44:35| and we had a couple this spring that was delighted that they could buy tomato plants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6275)|
| 1:44:40| and pepper plants and raise more food themselves, which is certainly good for a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6280)|
| 1:44:46| And we all know that healthy diets is something that improves our health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6286)|
| 1:44:51| reduces our costs for local government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6291)|
| 1:44:56| So, concerning the SNAP program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6296)|
| 1:45:00| I would like to ask you all to consider helping us some with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6300)|
| 1:45:05| And one way that I would like to suggest that you might help is helping us to let more people know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6305)|
| 1:45:14| that the farmer's market is an option for them to use their SNAP benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6314)|
| 1:45:19| And one of the places that we might could do that would be advertising on the CAT buses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6319)|
| 1:45:25| You know, for a lot of the folks you heard about with food policy council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6325)|
| 1:45:29| they talk about people being a food desert where there weren't good places to buy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6329)|
| 1:45:36| Certainly, those people with less resources may very well be regular riders of public transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6336)|
| 1:45:44| So, if we could maybe get some exposure in advertising that they do now on the buses for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6344)|
| 1:45:51| that would be helpful at both Market Square as well as New Harvest Park Farmer's Market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6351)|
| 1:45:59| The bus actually runs out to the side at New Harvest Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6359)|
| 1:46:03| It doesn't come up to the farmer's market itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6363)|
| 1:46:06| It comes to the AT&T store in the very front of that overall development there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6366)|
| 1:46:13| But it wouldn't be a lot of tweaking to maybe have the bus on Thursdays,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6373)|
| 1:46:19| which is the farmer's market day, swing up through the farmer's market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6379)|
| 1:46:23| so people wouldn't have to walk from the other side of the development to be able to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6383)|
| 1:46:28| And we'll be talking with the city and Mayor O'Hara about them helping with that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6388)|
| 1:46:36| Now, when you say help, are you looking for financial help?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6396)|
| 1:46:40| Well, one of the things that all farmer's markets have experienced in the last few years is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6400)|
| 1:46:46| we all used to be able to apply for a state grant for $10,000 for advertising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6406)|
| 1:46:51| A couple of years ago, the state cut that grant to $2,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6411)|
| 1:46:55| It's now $1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6415)|
| 1:46:57| $1,000 doesn't give you much money at all to advertise with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6417)|
| 1:47:01| So, we're very, very limited in our resources to be able to advertise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6421)|
| 1:47:06| I've talked with the Commissioner of Agriculture, Julius Johnson, about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6426)|
| 1:47:10| and asked for them to consider investing more heavily in that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6430)|
| 1:47:15| But during the budget cutbacks, they did cut our advertising money back considerably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6435)|
| 1:47:21| So, we really don't have the resources to spend on advertising in that manner like we used to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6441)|
| 1:47:28| If you wanted to give me a call, I'll be happy to meet with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6448)|
| 1:47:31| I know a little bit about advertising| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6451)|
| 1:47:33| and would be happy to talk to you about it as to how to maybe get the word out on some things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6453)|
| 1:47:39| But if you would like, I'm more than happy to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6459)|
| 1:47:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6463)|
| 1:47:44| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6464)|
| 1:47:46| Does anybody have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6466)|
| 1:47:48| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6468)|
| 1:47:49| I just want to say, David, you can give me a call, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6469)|
| 1:47:53| I don't know anything about sex, but I do know a lot about food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6473)|
| 1:47:57| And Martha Buchanan is right back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6477)|
| 1:48:00| And it seems like there's a natural connection somewhere for this topic with the health departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6480)|
| 1:48:07| and their initiatives on food and healthy diet and such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6487)|
| 1:48:13| But I would go ahead and help with that if you need me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6493)|
| 1:48:16| Are you saying we need a workshop there, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6496)|
| 1:48:21| Did you have anything else you wanted to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6501)|
| 1:48:23| Yes, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6503)|
| 1:48:24| I would like to ask for a small financial contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6504)|
| 1:48:29| And that would be to our office, UT Extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6509)|
| 1:48:32| And I would like to ask you all to consider $1,000 to our office that would be used for the following things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6512)|
| 1:48:42| Besides being able to come to the farmer's markets and buy food, another thing we do is a lot of educational programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6522)|
| 1:48:49| We have a once-a-month workshop with chefs from Pellissippi State that teach people how to prepare the food that they buy there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6529)|
| 1:48:58| My co-worker in the office, Heather Kyle, and she was going to come with me, but she's at the beach today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6538)|
| 1:49:03| so she just passed on her information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6543)|
| 1:49:07| One of the things that she's a family consumer science agent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6547)|
| 1:49:10| One of the things that has made a huge comeback is people canning and preserving food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6550)|
| 1:49:18| So Heather does, she tests the pressure cooker lids for people to make sure that their equipment is safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6558)|
| 1:49:26| And something that she'd like to be able to do more of is actual, we call them canning colleges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6566)|
| 1:49:31| where people come and they're taught to can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6571)|
| 1:49:34| Well, of course, even at New Harvest Park, there's a kitchen, but the kitchen only has a microwave and a refrigerator in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6574)|
| 1:49:42| She needs about $500 to equip her with a mobile kitchen that she can take out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6582)|
| 1:49:49| You have to have a fairly strong heat source to be able to do canning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6589)|
| 1:49:53| So she has to use an induction type of equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6593)|
| 1:49:57| And she priced all that out, and it's about $500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6597)|
| 1:50:02| Some on-site advertising things we'd like to ask for another $500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6602)|
| 1:50:07| And this is things like dry erase boards for signage at the market and festive banners to get people in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6607)|
| 1:50:17| We always start out very strong in the season, but as it gets deeper and deeper into the season,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6617)|
| 1:50:23| customers seem to drop off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6623)|
| 1:50:25| And our vendors need to be selling vegetables all season long, not just a big burst in the spring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6625)|
| 1:50:31| They can't get by with just that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6631)|
| 1:50:33| And certainly they've got lots to sell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6633)|
| 1:50:35| So the other $500 would be to do on-site advertising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6635)|
| 1:50:39| There's a sign at the entrance to the park that's broken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6639)|
| 1:50:45| We need to replace the track that holds the letters in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6645)|
| 1:50:48| We put letters to advertise different crops, and where it's broken, they fall out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6648)|
| 1:50:53| So, you know, a couple of issues like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6653)|
| 1:50:55| So I'd like to ask y'all's consideration for a $1,000 appropriation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6655)|
| 1:51:00| We'll talk with our finance director, and we'll see where we go with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6660)|
| 1:51:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6665)|
| 1:51:06| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6666)|
| 1:51:07| Any other questions, comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6667)|
| 1:51:08| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6668)|
| 1:51:09| We appreciate you being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6669)|
| 1:51:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6670)|
| 1:51:13| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6673)|
| 1:51:15| The next item is discussion regarding the Chamber of Commerce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6675)|
| 1:51:19| Yes, Commissioner Norman, you wanted to bring that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6679)|
| 1:51:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6682)|
| 1:51:23| Do we have some representatives of the Chamber here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6683)|
| 1:51:28| Jennifer, you want to take a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6688)|
| 1:51:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6692)|
| 1:51:38| We're going to ask Jennifer Evans, 8317 Alexander Cabot Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6698)|
| 1:51:42| The Chamber has been involved in a couple of fairly significant campaigns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6702)|
| 1:51:48| the latest, of course, regarding the budget and the school issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6708)|
| 1:51:51| One of the things in the process has been an issue of, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6711)|
| 1:51:57| the Chamber is privately funded and also receives public funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6717)|
| 1:52:03| and so there's some concern about the commingling of those funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6723)|
| 1:52:07| for various political enterprises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6727)|
| 1:52:10| So the question is, what is the intent of the Chamber as far as making available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6730)|
| 1:52:21| you know, some type of documentation of their,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6741)|
| 1:52:26| how they receive funds to support their campaign to support schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6746)|
| 1:52:33| So just basically a revenue statement, expense statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6753)|
| 1:52:37| contributions statement for those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6757)|
| 1:52:40| I'm wondering if those are forthcoming for the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6760)|
| 1:52:44| I don't know what we are allowed to ask for or even if we can ask for those legally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6764)|
| 1:52:53| and that's another question that I'll address to the law director in a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6773)|
| 1:52:57| But do you know of any effort by the Chamber now to say, given what we've been through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6777)|
| 1:53:04| you know, sort of the contentiousness of this effort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6784)|
| 1:53:09| if the Chamber is intending to report on that funding process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6789)|
| 1:53:16| and how those funds were used, et cetera?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6796)|
| 1:53:20| There have been discussions recently trying to figure out, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6800)|
| 1:53:23| what exactly we have to show and all those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6803)|
| 1:53:26| Obviously, we're audited annually successfully and there's never any issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6806)|
| 1:53:30| but I think it would be wise for you to, you know, see what you need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6810)|
| 1:53:34| or what's possible for us to show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6814)|
| 1:53:37| And, you know, we have discussed what exactly, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6817)|
| 1:53:40| we can make public and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6820)|
| 1:53:42| And so I think there was discussions last week about talking to our legal counsel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6822)|
| 1:53:47| to see, you know, what we could come up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6827)|
| 1:53:49| But it would be helpful if you could very specifically, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6829)|
| 1:53:53| let us know what you're asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6833)|
| 1:53:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6835)|
| 1:53:56| And, you know, fundamentally it's just how much, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6836)|
| 1:54:00| how you raise the money for the campaign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6840)|
| 1:54:04| To me, and I'm just speaking individually now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6844)|
| 1:54:07| that's what I would be interested in, how much money was raised for this campaign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6847)|
| 1:54:13| to support the school budget initiative and where those monies came from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6853)|
| 1:54:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6860)|
| 1:54:21| So supposedly these were private funds and so how much was used,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6861)|
| 1:54:26| how much, you know, how they were used, what were they used for in this campaign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6866)|
| 1:54:34| And then, you know, since I had this other issue that was also kind of near| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6874)|
| 1:54:39| and dear to my heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6879)|
| 1:54:40| It was called the Ridgetop Plan and it was a similar effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6880)|
| 1:54:44| I would personally like for you all to go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6884)|
| 1:54:47| and volunteer to show the same kind of descriptions of revenues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6887)|
| 1:54:55| and expenses in terms of the Ridgetop Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6895)|
| 1:54:58| I think that would be a good thing, just, you know, good business practice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6898)|
| 1:55:02| not trying to goad you or, you know, stick you with anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6902)|
| 1:55:08| I just think it's something that I know people that were in support of my position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6908)|
| 1:55:13| on our side on both of these topics, they were interested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6913)|
| 1:55:18| They're interested in how you're funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6918)|
| 1:55:20| We're still in contract negotiations, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6920)|
| 1:55:24| or we're in between approval of contract for funding of the chamber here in FY13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6924)|
| 1:55:31| And so those are just transparency issues that I think would be helpful to the chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6931)|
| 1:55:36| So does there need to be some type of, Chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6936)|
| 1:55:38| does there need to be some type of formal request of information you're asking from us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6938)|
| 1:55:42| and then how do we communicate going forward with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6942)|
| 1:55:46| Yes, he has, I think he's made the request for the two campaigns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6946)|
| 1:55:52| And so if you'd like, I'll, do you want to send a letter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6952)|
| 1:55:58| I'll be happy to as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6958)|
| 1:56:00| So we need to form a letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6960)|
| 1:56:02| Okay, I mean, and we need to confer with the law director on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6962)|
| 1:56:06| This is on the fly stuff right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6966)|
| 1:56:08| So we'll do that and then if necessary we'll send a letter on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6968)|
| 1:56:12| That'd be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6972)|
| 1:56:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6973)|
| 1:56:16| Yes, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6976)|
| 1:56:17| Mr. Law Director, from what Tony's asking there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6977)|
| 1:56:20| since we do fund them money, don't they have to do that, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6980)|
| 1:56:24| Well, your code reads that anyone who does receive funding is subject to audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6984)|
| 1:56:30| But that's as broad as your code reads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6990)|
| 1:56:34| But obviously, you know, when you're,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6994)|
| 1:56:37| unless you're dealing with proprietary information such as copyright,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=6997)|
| 1:56:40| trademark and things that are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7000)|
| 1:56:42| would generally be exempt from the open records law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7002)|
| 1:56:45| you know, your requests, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7005)|
| 1:56:47| seem reasonable and in line with the current law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7007)|
| 1:56:51| Tony, I think they'll give us everything that we're asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7011)|
| 1:56:54| Mr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7014)|
| 1:56:55| Yes, I guess I was wondering too, I mean, we give to a lot of charities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7015)|
| 1:56:59| but we don't get a list of who their donors are necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7019)|
| 1:57:02| I mean, I mean, is this being done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7022)|
| 1:57:08| is it just a personal request on his part?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7028)|
| 1:57:10| Is this something we're going to vote on or what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7030)|
| 1:57:12| I think it's a personal request from Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7032)|
| 1:57:15| I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7035)|
| 1:57:16| I mean, but you sort of implied that you would send a letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7036)|
| 1:57:18| on behalf of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7038)|
| 1:57:20| Well, yeah, that was an error.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7040)|
| 1:57:21| I shouldn't have said that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7041)|
| 1:57:22| You're exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7042)|
| 1:57:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7043)|
| 1:57:24| Yeah, this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7044)|
| 1:57:25| I'm just, I'm just trying to clarify, you know, what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7045)|
| 1:57:29| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7049)|
| 1:57:30| You're exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7050)|
| 1:57:31| I'm going to let Commissioner Norman get his information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7051)|
| 1:57:32| but no, I don't need to send a letter on behalf of the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7052)|
| 1:57:34| unless we vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7054)|
| 1:57:35| But Commissioner Norman says that he'll make that request as a commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7055)|
| 1:57:38| and he's certainly within his rights to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7058)|
| 1:57:41| Yes, Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7061)|
| 1:57:42| Yeah, I just want to put it, we do give a lot of money to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7062)|
| 1:57:46| we give some money to various charities and don't ask who their donors are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7066)|
| 1:57:50| but they don't engage in active campaigning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7070)|
| 1:57:54| and lobbying on specific issues that come before commissions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7074)|
| 1:57:59| So I think that's, correct me if I'm wrong, Tony,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7079)|
| 1:58:03| but I think that's where you were coming from on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7083)|
| 1:58:06| or that's the difference that I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7086)|
| 1:58:08| I mean, we had just last, a couple of weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7088)|
| 1:58:11| we had the people from CAC here lobbying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7091)|
| 1:58:15| I mean, I call it lobbying when they come down here asking for money, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7095)|
| 1:58:20| Well, that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7100)|
| 1:58:21| We have just about every group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7101)|
| 1:58:23| I mean, we've had the homeless people come down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7103)|
| 1:58:26| I think you would even have to admit that there's a difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7106)|
| 1:58:29| between, you know, a few hundred thousand for CAC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7109)|
| 1:58:33| and $35 million for the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7113)|
| 1:58:38| So I'm not, you know, coming down on either side of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7118)|
| 1:58:42| I'm just trying to understand Tony's perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7122)|
| 1:58:46| and it makes sense to me why he's asking for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7126)|
| 1:58:50| I understand where he's coming from on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7130)|
| 1:58:53| And I'll, as I said, I'll confer with the law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7133)|
| 1:58:57| and then I will inform the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7137)|
| 1:59:01| and forward any type of communication that I have to the full body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7141)|
| 1:59:06| so everybody knows what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7146)|
| 1:59:09| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7149)|
| 1:59:10| Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7150)|
| 1:59:12| I had asked about the possibility of us moving our zonings to 5 o'clock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7152)|
| 1:59:18| and that was supposed to go to the rules committee or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7158)|
| 1:59:20| Are we anywhere close to any kind of decision or voting on that issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7160)|
| 1:59:25| Yes, we're going to have a rules committee meeting at the end of the next workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7165)|
| 1:59:29| to deal with your request and also the issue with the prayers rules change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7169)|
| 1:59:35| So we're going to do that after the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7175)|
| 1:59:37| The rules committee will meet after the workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7177)|
| 1:59:38| and whoever wants to stay can stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7178)|
| 1:59:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7180)|
| 1:59:43| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7183)|
| 1:59:44| I think we have one more item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7184)|
| 1:59:45| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7185)|
| 1:59:48| Well, it's resolution 908 that's been deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7188)|
| 1:59:53| But, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7193)|
| 1:59:54| This was about the teacher survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7194)|
| 1:59:58| We talked about the chairman's lunch today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7198)|
| 2:00:01| and our law director came up with, well, he didn't come up with anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7201)|
| 2:00:06| but he has advised us that he needs to look into this survey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7206)|
| 2:00:10| because he needs to make sure anonymity on this survey is critical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7210)|
| 2:00:15| He's not sure that we can do that given the fact that it is a public type situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7215)|
| 2:00:20| with taxpayer dollars, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7220)|
| 2:00:22| So he's going to look into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7222)|
| 2:00:24| I told him that I did not want to move forward with any kind of survey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7224)|
| 2:00:28| and have any more work done by the purchasing department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7228)|
| 2:00:31| or anything else until we know that for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7231)|
| 2:00:33| Because if he feels that we cannot do a confidential survey of the teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7233)|
| 2:00:39| then I really don't want to move ahead with it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7239)|
| 2:00:41| because I just don't think they'll participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7241)|
| 2:00:45| But did you have any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7245)|
| 2:00:50| Well, first of all, I think the survey is a very good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7250)|
| 2:00:58| It's just late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7258)|
| 2:01:01| The survey, a well-done survey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7261)|
| 2:01:04| would have been a thing that should have been implemented three years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7264)|
| 2:01:11| The strategic plan is in question in terms of its accomplishments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7271)|
| 2:01:24| So a survey now, my question about a survey anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7284)|
| 2:01:29| what is the intent of the survey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7289)|
| 2:01:31| So is the survey as you structured it, would it be a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7291)|
| 2:01:37| I mean, it could go in multiple directions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7297)|
| 2:01:41| And if it started with assumptions that I think are faulty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7301)|
| 2:01:49| such as some of the policies which are being,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7309)|
| 2:01:53| that are apparently going forward, I just don't think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7313)|
| 2:01:57| I don't see it being helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7317)|
| 2:01:59| So I have a lot of questions about the, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7319)|
| 2:02:03| the survey now at this late date and what's the intent of the survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7323)|
| 2:02:09| So what can we accomplish by a survey now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7329)|
| 2:02:14| And if it's only to reinforce some policies that I think are faulty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7334)|
| 2:02:20| I would not be in favor of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7340)|
| 2:02:24| It's not too late for next year, Tony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7344)|
| 2:02:27| Commissioner, the idea of the survey actually came from my daughter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7347)|
| 2:02:31| She's a teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7351)|
| 2:02:33| And we were talking about the situation that was going on in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7353)|
| 2:02:36| with the budget and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7356)|
| 2:02:38| And her comment to me was, she said, well, have you asked the teachers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7358)|
| 2:02:42| And I looked at her and I said, well, no, I haven't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7362)|
| 2:02:46| And she said, well, maybe you ought to think about doing a survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7366)|
| 2:02:49| That's how this whole thing came about was her being a teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7369)|
| 2:02:52| And she said, I really believe that the teachers would appreciate being asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7372)|
| 2:02:55| because she's not in the Knox County system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7375)|
| 2:02:57| She's in other systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7377)|
| 2:02:59| And so I'm not saying that we don't ask teachers or that they're not getting input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7379)|
| 2:03:03| But to do a confidential survey, and my idea was to find out from them other things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7383)|
| 2:03:09| that we could do to help them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7389)|
| 2:03:11| Because if we're going to move the meter and do the things that we want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7391)|
| 2:03:14| accomplish in Knox County, I think it's got to be in the classroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7394)|
| 2:03:17| and it's got to be that dynamic between the teacher and those students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7397)|
| 2:03:20| So are there things there that we can do as far as structuring the survey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7400)|
| 2:03:23| and how we do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7403)|
| 2:03:25| We kind of put all that on hold until we find out if, indeed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7405)|
| 2:03:27| we can have an anonymous survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7407)|
| 2:03:29| Because if we can't, then I don't want to move forward with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7409)|
| 2:03:32| But if we do, then we come back and we take a look at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7412)|
| 2:03:34| and work with the schools on, you know, developing, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7414)|
| 2:03:37| how the scope and how it would be structured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7417)|
| 2:03:41| And I do think and I do applaud the effort to get information from teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7421)|
| 2:03:49| But, of course, given the way the budget battle went on the school side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7429)|
| 2:03:57| obviously there is the interest of the teachers, at least a significant portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7437)|
| 2:04:03| of the teachers are feeling they were not represented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7443)|
| 2:04:08| And so this is an effort that might be helpful to those that are feeling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7448)|
| 2:04:13| they're not represented, they're not heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7453)|
| 2:04:18| And so that might help in some way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7458)|
| 2:04:24| But I would also offer up the caution that unless they were included in how the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7464)|
| 2:04:34| survey was, you know, such as representatives from KCA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7474)|
| 2:04:38| unless they were included in how that survey was structured,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7478)|
| 2:04:43| the types of questions that were answered or asked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7483)|
| 2:04:48| it probably isn't going to produce, it's not going to produce its intent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7488)|
| 2:04:55| I don't think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7495)|
| 2:04:56| And so, you know, there's got to be some real fundamental parts to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7496)|
| 2:05:01| that somebody from purchasing just can't do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7501)|
| 2:05:04| I mean, we just can't contract somebody outside without including the teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7504)|
| 2:05:09| you know, some fairly good sample of teachers to be in the process, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7509)|
| 2:05:15| So, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7515)|
| 2:05:17| Mr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7517)|
| 2:05:18| Yeah, Tony, I want to just make a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7518)|
| 2:05:20| You weren't able to attend the chairman's luncheon today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7520)|
| 2:05:23| and also some of the school board met yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7523)|
| 2:05:27| And I did go to that meeting that was at Panera's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7527)|
| 2:05:29| It was one of those meetings that got announced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7529)|
| 2:05:32| But I think that what Mike was referring to just a minute ago was that I think there's no question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7532)|
| 2:05:37| I think one thing we would all have to agree on is that the budget that was proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7537)|
| 2:05:42| and some of the plans that were proposed, whether you agreed with them or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7542)|
| 2:05:46| it certainly showed that there was a lot of community interest in what's going on in the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7546)|
| 2:05:50| whether you agree with it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7550)|
| 2:05:53| And I really think that, and I don't want to be putting words into Mike's mouth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7553)|
| 2:05:59| but we are looking ahead to not only next year, but maybe the next three or four years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7559)|
| 2:06:05| is to find out what do we need to do about the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7565)|
| 2:06:09| You know, there are some things I think that's very good that's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7569)|
| 2:06:12| There may be things that aren't good that's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7572)|
| 2:06:16| But what we've certainly done is to open the community debate on these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7576)|
| 2:06:20| And I think that that's Mike's purpose for this is to try to be more inclusive with everyone that's involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7580)|
| 2:06:27| whether it's the KCEA, the teachers that don't belong to the KCEA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7587)|
| 2:06:33| But if you really look at it, I mean, those are the ones, I mean, that's where the rubber meets the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7593)|
| 2:06:39| is where you have the student-teacher interface.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7599)|
| 2:06:42| And I think too often we focus on what's going on maybe in the central office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7602)|
| 2:06:46| or what's going on with iPads or accountability or other things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7606)|
| 2:06:50| but probably the people that know more about it than anything are the teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7610)|
| 2:06:54| And I really think that that was the purpose of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7614)|
| 2:06:57| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7617)|
| 2:06:58| The only other thing that I'd say, Mr. Chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7618)|
| 2:07:00| is that there's absolutely some wonderful things that are going on in the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7620)|
| 2:07:06| And, of course, we're all trying to maximize our funding of those wonderful things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7626)|
| 2:07:13| And I will keep speaking to my disagreement with two fundamental policies that are taking place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7633)|
| 2:07:25| that are going to be going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7645)|
| 2:07:27| Okay, the way merit pay is done and their evaluation system for teachers right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7647)|
| 2:07:33| is detrimental to this system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7653)|
| 2:07:35| I do not think it is being considered or even reconsidered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7655)|
| 2:07:40| Their strategic plan is in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7660)|
| 2:07:42| They're going forward regardless of this setback that they just experienced at the budget level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7662)|
| 2:07:48| So I'll continue to fight that fight because I think that it's the right fight to fight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7668)|
| 2:07:55| And hopefully there will be some reconsideration sometime in terms of these two policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7675)|
| 2:08:06| That was the last item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7686)|
| 2:08:07| Is there any other business to come before this commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7687)|
| 2:08:11| If not, we are adjourned until 6 o'clock when we'll do zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7691)|
| 2:08:15| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7695)|
| 2:08:16| Yes, I'm sorry, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7696)|
| 2:08:17| I just wanted to say I need to be excused from zonings tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7697)|
| 2:08:20| Avery has a swim team practice in her transportation, so sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7700)|
| 2:08:28| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7708)|
| 2:08:29| I got a Rocky Top playing at 6 and I'm going to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7709)|
| 2:08:32| Is that the R. Larry Smith League or team?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7712)|
| 2:08:35| The undefeated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7715)|
| 2:08:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7716)|
| 2:08:37| We are adjourned until 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120625?start=7717)|
