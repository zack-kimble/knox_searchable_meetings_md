| 0:01:08| I haven't, so I'll sign them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=68)|
| 0:01:10| after he makes a presentation. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=70)|
| 0:01:22| Mr. Chairman, I'd like to ask the Wright family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=82)|
| 0:01:24| if they would please come to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=84)|
| 0:01:48| Commissioners, this is the Wright family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=108)|
| 0:01:50| and they lost their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=110)|
| 0:01:52| husband slash dad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=112)|
| 0:01:54| about a month ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=114)|
| 0:01:56| And not to go, because they were telling me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=116)|
| 0:01:58| it's some three pages of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=118)|
| 0:02:00| what all that Mr. Wright had done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=120)|
| 0:02:04| And if any of y'all want to say something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=124)|
| 0:02:06| y'all feel free to do also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=126)|
| 0:02:08| But Bill Wright was a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=128)|
| 0:02:10| Knoxville-born individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=130)|
| 0:02:12| He played ball at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=132)|
| 0:02:14| Knoxville High.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=134)|
| 0:02:16| Was at Lettard in several sports, and from there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=136)|
| 0:02:18| went on to the University of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=138)|
| 0:02:20| and played basketball| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=140)|
| 0:02:22| and some other sports, and from there he was in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=142)|
| 0:02:24| World War II, and he went| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=144)|
| 0:02:26| and played basketball at Duke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=146)|
| 0:02:28| Played a little bit of basketball at Duke and came back and played some more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=148)|
| 0:02:30| at Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=150)|
| 0:02:32| And at Tennessee, what he was mainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=152)|
| 0:02:34| known for, he was the baseball coach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=154)|
| 0:02:36| at UT. For how many years was he?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=156)|
| 0:02:38| 19 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=158)|
| 0:02:40| He was the baseball coach at UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=160)|
| 0:02:44| He was a very, very fine individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=164)|
| 0:02:46| Met him several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=166)|
| 0:02:48| Played a lot of the games and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=168)|
| 0:02:50| Fine Christian individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=170)|
| 0:02:52| One of the sons even played basketball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=172)|
| 0:02:54| One of the few groups where we had a father-son| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=174)|
| 0:02:56| duo that played basketball at UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=176)|
| 0:02:58| And so I have a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=178)|
| 0:03:00| here honoring him for all that he has done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=180)|
| 0:03:02| at the University of Tennessee and in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=182)|
| 0:03:04| community, what all he has done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=184)|
| 0:03:06| I even have some surprises for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=186)|
| 0:03:08| I took the liberty of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=188)|
| 0:03:10| giving you some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=190)|
| 0:03:12| 1946 pictures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=192)|
| 0:03:14| of your dad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=194)|
| 0:03:16| I had those made up and blown up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=196)|
| 0:03:18| There's some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=198)|
| 0:03:20| 46-47 team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=200)|
| 0:03:22| and the 42-43 were the SEC champions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=202)|
| 0:03:24| And then Steve, when you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=204)|
| 0:03:26| played on the basketball team a couple of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=206)|
| 0:03:28| here's you some prints from where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=208)|

| 0:03:32| Thank you, Larry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=212)|
| 0:03:38| I just wanted to thank Larry for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=218)|
| 0:03:40| this honor and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=220)|
| 0:03:42| the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=222)|
| 0:03:44| Mainly what I wanted to say just briefly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=224)|
| 0:03:46| was my dad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=226)|
| 0:03:48| lived 87 years and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=228)|
| 0:03:50| except for playing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=230)|

| 0:03:56| with tuberculosis and being in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=236)|
| 0:03:58| World War II, he lived every minute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=238)|
| 0:04:00| of his life in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=240)|
| 0:04:02| and mainly in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=242)|
| 0:04:04| I just wanted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=244)|
| 0:04:06| let everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=246)|

| 0:04:10| the nice things that have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=250)|
| 0:04:12| said about our dad by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=252)|
| 0:04:14| university and by people that knew him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=254)|
| 0:04:16| that were at his funeral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=256)|

| 0:04:36| we have on the agenda today, but we do have one person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=276)|
| 0:04:38| who wanted to address us in public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=278)|
| 0:04:40| Mr. Victor Spencer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=280)|
| 0:04:42| If you would come to the podium, please give us your address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=282)|

| 0:04:50| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=290)|
| 0:04:52| My name is Vic Spencer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=292)|
| 0:04:54| I live at 11012| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=294)|
| 0:04:56| Flotilla Drive in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=296)|
| 0:04:58| Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=298)|
| 0:05:00| I'm sorry, but I'm having problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=300)|
| 0:05:02| with transmitting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=302)|
| 0:05:04| the presentation, so I'm going to talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=304)|
| 0:05:06| you through it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=306)|
| 0:05:08| I'm going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=308)|
| 0:05:10| addressing the job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=310)|
| 0:05:12| and college readiness on the educational| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=312)|
| 0:05:14| side, which is the most important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=314)|
| 0:05:16| question, despite the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=316)|
| 0:05:18| that our ACT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=318)|
| 0:05:20| performance has not been good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=320)|
| 0:05:22| as I have presented before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=322)|
| 0:05:24| For example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=324)|
| 0:05:26| if we take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=326)|
| 0:05:30| students who entered a freshman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=330)|
| 0:05:32| year as 100,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=332)|
| 0:05:34| 100% or the number 100,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=334)|
| 0:05:36| when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=336)|
| 0:05:38| we consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=338)|
| 0:05:40| dropouts, which are at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=340)|
| 0:05:42| 14.6%, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=342)|
| 0:05:44| drops to 85.4%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=344)|
| 0:05:46| Then we consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=346)|
| 0:05:48| how many of those get a diploma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=348)|
| 0:05:50| That drops us to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=350)|
| 0:05:52| 74%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=352)|
| 0:05:54| And only 21%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=354)|
| 0:05:56| of those are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=356)|
| 0:05:58| job and college ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=358)|
| 0:06:00| When we apply that, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=360)|
| 0:06:02| end up with only 15.5%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=362)|
| 0:06:04| of the students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=364)|
| 0:06:06| who enter the freshman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=366)|
| 0:06:08| year being job and college| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=368)|
| 0:06:10| ready. In my presentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=370)|
| 0:06:12| that I will supply to all of you, I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=372)|
| 0:06:14| references on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=374)|
| 0:06:16| ACT position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=376)|
| 0:06:18| today about job and college| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=378)|
| 0:06:20| readiness, and also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=380)|
| 0:06:22| the figures that I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=382)|
| 0:06:24| quoting, which are state of Tennessee figures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=384)|
| 0:06:26| If I were to graph| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=386)|
| 0:06:28| this, we are going to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=388)|

| 0:06:40| on the other side, we also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=400)|
| 0:06:42| have a curve that raises equally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=402)|
| 0:06:44| steeply, and that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=404)|
| 0:06:46| those who are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=406)|

| 0:06:56| If we take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=416)|

| 0:07:02| we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=422)|
| 0:07:04| to multiply it by 6.45| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=424)|
| 0:07:06| to get to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=426)|
| 0:07:08| representing not only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=428)|
| 0:07:10| the kids who are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=430)|
| 0:07:12| job ready coming out of high school, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=432)|
| 0:07:14| all those that we have to spend the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=434)|
| 0:07:16| amount of money on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=436)|
| 0:07:18| to finish high school who are not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=438)|
| 0:07:20| job and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=440)|
| 0:07:22| college ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=442)|
| 0:07:24| And that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=444)|
| 0:07:26| creates a huge problem because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=446)|
| 0:07:28| the cost for 12 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=448)|
| 0:07:30| for one student| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=450)|
| 0:07:32| is $120,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=452)|
| 0:07:34| Not too unreasonable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=454)|
| 0:07:36| but my figure is a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=456)|
| 0:07:38| higher than what's published because I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=458)|
| 0:07:40| considering also capital costs and interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=460)|
| 0:07:42| expenses that we do pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=462)|
| 0:07:44| into the education side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=464)|
| 0:07:46| of the appropriate budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=466)|
| 0:07:48| So, if we take into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=468)|
| 0:07:50| account those kids who are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=470)|

| 0:07:56| job and college ready,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=476)|
| 0:07:58| then we get from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=478)|
| 0:08:00| $120,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=480)|
| 0:08:02| $774,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=482)|
| 0:08:04| as the cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=484)|
| 0:08:06| of producing one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=486)|

| 0:08:10| ready child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=490)|
| 0:08:12| If I am to compare that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=492)|
| 0:08:14| to competitive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=494)|

| 0:08:22| the U.S. range| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=502)|

| 0:08:34| job and college readiness is that much better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=514)|
| 0:08:36| although parents have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=516)|
| 0:08:38| foot the bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=518)|
| 0:08:40| And international leaders are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=520)|

| 0:08:44| area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=524)|
| 0:08:46| with better methodologies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=526)|
| 0:08:48| that took 15 years to develop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=528)|
| 0:08:50| and much better results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=530)|
| 0:08:52| I am using figures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=532)|

| 0:08:58| employed kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=538)|
| 0:09:00| who are not job or college ready will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=540)|
| 0:09:02| cost us a mint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=542)|
| 0:09:04| in unemployment and other support functions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=544)|

| 0:09:08| is tax dollars. It's our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=548)|

| 0:09:22| destruction of all of our industries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=562)|

| 0:09:28| progress on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=568)|
| 0:09:30| And it's nowhere near the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=570)|
| 0:09:32| We are now, not only have lost some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=572)|
| 0:09:34| industries, as you know, to imports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=574)|
| 0:09:36| but we are losing 5%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=576)|

| 0:10:39| I had a good background| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=639)|
| 0:10:41| to look at this and to find out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=641)|
| 0:10:43| exactly what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=643)|
| 0:10:45| State,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=645)|
| 0:10:47| in order of priority, always top down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=647)|
| 0:10:49| You can't solve problems going from the bottom up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=649)|
| 0:10:51| It's the top| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=651)|
| 0:10:53| layers that control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=653)|

| 0:11:01| About five changes need to be made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=661)|
| 0:11:03| because they are creating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=663)|
| 0:11:05| the current situation here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=665)|

| 0:11:13| Central management size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=673)|
| 0:11:15| is not a trivial question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=675)|
| 0:11:17| regardless of how anyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=677)|
| 0:11:19| presents it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=679)|
| 0:11:21| I can assure you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=681)|
| 0:11:23| that groups like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=683)|
| 0:11:25| become self-protective and so on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=685)|
| 0:11:27| and when that happens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=687)|
| 0:11:29| they don't serve the cause anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=689)|

| 0:11:49| And way down on the bottom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=709)|
| 0:11:51| we can monkey around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=711)|
| 0:11:53| with antiquated teaching methodologies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=713)|
| 0:11:55| and teachers in general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=715)|
| 0:11:57| but we are looking at methods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=717)|
| 0:11:59| that failed in other countries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=719)|

| 0:12:17| in how they do the business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=737)|

| 0:12:21| 32nd or 34th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=741)|

| 0:12:33| It takes 15 to 20 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=753)|
| 0:12:35| of research| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=755)|
| 0:12:37| to do that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=757)|
| 0:12:39| Mr. Spencer, your five minutes are up sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=759)|
| 0:12:41| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=761)|
| 0:12:43| Do you need another minute?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=763)|
| 0:12:45| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=765)|
| 0:12:47| If anyone has any questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=767)|
| 0:12:49| I'll be happy to answer them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=769)|
| 0:12:51| One thing I would like to mention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=771)|
| 0:12:53| I really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=773)|
| 0:12:55| although initially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=775)|
| 0:12:57| I blamed some people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=777)|
| 0:12:59| I don't have any such ideas today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=779)|
| 0:13:01| because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=781)|
| 0:13:03| if we look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=783)|
| 0:13:07| the board or the superintendent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=787)|
| 0:13:09| they are between a rock and a hard place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=789)|
| 0:13:11| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=791)|
| 0:13:13| The laws control things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=793)|
| 0:13:19| There are some issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=799)|
| 0:13:21| that I don't think we can criticize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=801)|
| 0:13:23| individuals on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=803)|
| 0:13:25| but I think we have to go in a very systematic way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=805)|
| 0:13:27| on a state level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=807)|
| 0:13:29| and I think Bill Haslam is the right guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=809)|
| 0:13:31| I see some things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=811)|
| 0:13:33| that are really heading in the right direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=813)|
| 0:13:35| and I'm hopeful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=815)|
| 0:13:37| that we'll resolve that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=817)|
| 0:13:39| because I love this country and I love this place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=819)|
| 0:13:41| And excuse me for showing up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=821)|
| 0:13:43| with a stain on my shirt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=823)|
| 0:13:45| so don't photograph me whoever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=825)|
| 0:13:47| because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=827)|
| 0:13:49| the carrying strap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=829)|
| 0:13:51| on my case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=831)|
| 0:13:53| I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=833)|
| 0:13:55| somehow I got some dirt on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=835)|
| 0:13:57| and I don't have a spare shirt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=837)|
| 0:13:59| for my presentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=839)|
| 0:14:01| and my underwear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=841)|
| 0:14:03| so thank you very much for listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=843)|
| 0:14:05| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=845)|
| 0:14:07| We appreciate your addressing us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=847)|
| 0:14:09| Commissioner Norman, do you have anything you want to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=849)|
| 0:14:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=851)|
| 0:14:13| Thank you, Mr. Spencer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=853)|
| 0:14:15| You've been here before with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=855)|
| 0:14:17| so you think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=857)|
| 0:14:19| the solution is at the state level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=859)|
| 0:14:21| to issues that you're bringing up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=861)|
| 0:14:23| so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=863)|
| 0:14:25| what is it that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=865)|
| 0:14:27| this body can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=867)|
| 0:14:29| in terms of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=869)|
| 0:14:31| Do you have some further action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=871)|
| 0:14:33| or some further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=873)|
| 0:14:35| recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=875)|
| 0:14:37| that you're going to provide us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=877)|
| 0:14:39| to go forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=879)|
| 0:14:41| with state legislators?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=881)|
| 0:14:43| What do you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=883)|
| 0:14:45| ahead of you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=885)|
| 0:14:47| I communicated already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=887)|
| 0:14:49| on this subject with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=889)|
| 0:14:51| people in Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=891)|
| 0:14:53| and other states.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=893)|
| 0:14:55| I really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=895)|
| 0:14:57| don't want to go publicly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=897)|
| 0:14:59| into details but I'll give you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=899)|
| 0:15:01| one example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=901)|
| 0:15:03| There is no group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=903)|
| 0:15:05| and there is no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=905)|
| 0:15:07| activity that can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=907)|
| 0:15:09| deliver| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=909)|
| 0:15:11| with good results| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=911)|
| 0:15:13| if it doesn't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=913)|
| 0:15:15| measurable goals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=915)|
| 0:15:17| without any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=917)|
| 0:15:19| haze| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=919)|
| 0:15:21| and does not have an operating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=921)|
| 0:15:23| plan to achieve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=923)|
| 0:15:25| the same by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=925)|
| 0:15:27| operating unit as well as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=927)|
| 0:15:29| the company itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=929)|
| 0:15:31| This is in the realm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=931)|
| 0:15:33| of state law protecting a status| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=933)|
| 0:15:35| quo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=935)|
| 0:15:37| And it will be changed. Otherwise we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=937)|
| 0:15:39| will go down as a country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=939)|
| 0:15:41| Again, thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=941)|
| 0:15:43| so much for addressing us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=943)|
| 0:15:45| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=945)|
| 0:15:47| It is 2.04. We're going to take a five minute quick recess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=947)|
| 0:15:49| to kind of regroup and get ready for our regular session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=949)|
| 0:15:51| We'll come back into session at 2.10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=951)|
| 0:16:21| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=981)|
| 0:16:23| As always, I like to stand here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=983)|
| 0:16:25| because I think I'm talking to my friends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=985)|
| 0:16:27| when I do what I'm about to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=987)|
| 0:16:29| First, let me give you a disclaimer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=989)|
| 0:16:31| I've used this book| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=991)|
| 0:16:33| three times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=993)|
| 0:16:35| And if there's anyone to blame| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=995)|
| 0:16:37| for what I'm about to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=997)|
| 0:16:39| it's not me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=999)|
| 0:16:41| It's not me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1001)|
| 0:16:43| It's not me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1003)|
| 0:16:45| It's not me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1005)|
| 0:16:47| It's not me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1007)|
| 0:16:49| If there's anyone to blame| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1009)|
| 0:16:51| for what I'm about to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1011)|
| 0:16:53| it's Judge Workman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1013)|
| 0:16:57| Sometimes people get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1017)|
| 0:16:59| separated and move off in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1019)|
| 0:17:01| different directions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1021)|
| 0:17:03| And what I'm about to use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1023)|
| 0:17:05| is sort of like an email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1025)|
| 0:17:07| Did anybody get any emails today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1027)|
| 0:17:09| Well, this is an email from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1029)|
| 0:17:11| Peter sent off to some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1031)|
| 0:17:13| people that had moved from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1033)|
| 0:17:15| wherever he was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1035)|
| 0:17:17| This is 1 Peter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1037)|
| 0:17:19| This is about the 8th verse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1039)|
| 0:17:24| And he starts off by saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1044)|
| 0:17:26| Have unity of spirit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1046)|
| 0:17:29| And then I add the word| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1049)|
| 0:17:31| have in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1051)|
| 0:17:33| Have sympathy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1053)|
| 0:17:35| Have love for one another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1055)|
| 0:17:39| Have a tender heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1059)|
| 0:17:41| And have a humble mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1061)|
| 0:17:43| Do not repay evil for evil| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1063)|
| 0:17:46| or abuse for abuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1066)|
| 0:17:48| But on the contrary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1068)|
| 0:17:50| repay with a blessing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1070)|
| 0:17:54| It is for this that you were called| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1074)|
| 0:17:56| that you might inherit a blessing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1076)|
| 0:18:00| And then I believe it appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1080)|
| 0:18:02| that he used something in some older text| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1082)|
| 0:18:04| probably out of the Old Testament.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1084)|
| 0:18:06| And he said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1086)|
| 0:18:07| For the eyes of the Lord| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1087)|
| 0:18:09| are on the righteous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1089)|
| 0:18:11| and His ears are open to their prayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1091)|
| 0:18:15| The face of the Lord| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1095)|
| 0:18:17| is against those who do evil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1097)|
| 0:18:20| And then he continued on with his own thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1100)|
| 0:18:24| Keep your conscience clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1104)|
| 0:18:27| so that when you are maligned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1107)|
| 0:18:30| those who abuse you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1110)|
| 0:18:33| for the good that you conduct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1113)|
| 0:18:36| may be put to shame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1116)|
| 0:18:39| For it is better to suffer for doing good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1119)|
| 0:18:42| if suffering be your fate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1122)|
| 0:18:45| than to suffer for doing evil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1125)|
| 0:18:51| I invoke the blessings of our Heavenly Father| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1131)|
| 0:18:54| and I pray that we be filled with grace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1134)|
| 0:18:58| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1138)|
| 0:19:00| Thank you, Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1140)|
| 0:19:02| Now for our pledge of the flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1142)|
| 0:19:03| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1143)|
| 0:19:04| Please stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1144)|
| 0:19:06| Face the flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1146)|
| 0:19:08| Proper salute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1148)|
| 0:19:09| I pledge allegiance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1149)|
| 0:19:11| to the flag| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1151)|
| 0:19:12| of the United States of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1152)|
| 0:19:14| and to the republic for which it stands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1154)|
| 0:19:17| one nation under God| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1157)|
| 0:19:19| indivisible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1159)|
| 0:19:20| with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1160)|
| 0:19:25| I had meant to call on Commissioner Borles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1165)|
| 0:19:27| during our public forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1167)|
| 0:19:28| and neglected to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1168)|
| 0:19:29| Commissioner Borles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1169)|
| 0:19:30| would you like to make your statement now, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1170)|
| 0:19:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1173)|
| 0:19:34| Yesterday was the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1174)|
| 0:19:36| It's Okay to Say Gay rally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1176)|
| 0:19:38| which was organized in response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1178)|
| 0:19:40| to Stacey Canfield's proposed legislation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1180)|
| 0:19:43| at the state level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1183)|
| 0:19:45| and I had intended to be there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1185)|
| 0:19:46| and I had told my constituents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1186)|
| 0:19:48| that I would be there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1188)|
| 0:19:49| and I had a family conflict| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1189)|
| 0:19:51| that came up at the last minute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1191)|
| 0:19:53| that we couldn't make it work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1193)|
| 0:19:55| so I wanted to take this opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1195)|
| 0:19:58| during public forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1198)|
| 0:19:59| to say a few things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1199)|
| 0:20:00| that I intended to say yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1200)|
| 0:20:03| Almost three years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1203)|
| 0:20:06| someone who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1206)|
| 0:20:09| who had a lot of hate in them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1209)|
| 0:20:11| and especially towards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1211)|
| 0:20:14| gay and lesbians| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1214)|
| 0:20:15| came into our church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1215)|
| 0:20:16| and started blowing people away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1216)|
| 0:20:19| Out of that event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1219)|
| 0:20:20| grew an organization in our congregation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1220)|
| 0:20:22| called Standing on the Side of Love.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1222)|
| 0:20:25| As Unitarian Universalists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1225)|
| 0:20:27| we believe in the inherent worth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1227)|
| 0:20:29| and dignity of every person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1229)|
| 0:20:32| and Standing on the Side of Love| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1232)|
| 0:20:34| calls us to live that principle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1234)|
| 0:20:35| in our daily lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1235)|
| 0:20:37| This legislation I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1237)|
| 0:20:38| is contrary to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1238)|
| 0:20:40| Standing on the Side of Love| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1240)|
| 0:20:41| recognizes the inherent worth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1241)|
| 0:20:43| and dignity of gays, lesbians,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1243)|
| 0:20:45| bisexual and transgender persons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1245)|
| 0:20:47| and it also recognizes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1247)|
| 0:20:49| the inherent worth and dignity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1249)|
| 0:20:50| of Stacey Canfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1250)|
| 0:20:52| Tennessee is not a hateful place to live| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1252)|
| 0:20:56| and I hope that the rest of the country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1256)|
| 0:20:58| will look past this legislation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1258)|
| 0:21:00| and will see that Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1260)|
| 0:21:02| and especially East Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1262)|
| 0:21:04| is the best place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1264)|
| 0:21:05| the very best place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1265)|
| 0:21:06| to live and work and raise a family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1266)|
| 0:21:09| And I hope that we can move beyond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1269)|
| 0:21:12| a lot of the mean spiritedness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1272)|
| 0:21:14| that we are seeing in government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1274)|
| 0:21:17| and that we can all begin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1277)|
| 0:21:19| to stand on the side of love.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1279)|
| 0:21:22| And I will continue personally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1282)|
| 0:21:25| to stand on the side of love| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1285)|
| 0:21:26| and to pray for all of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1286)|
| 0:21:29| including Stacey Canfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1289)|
| 0:21:32| So I'm sorry that I did not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1292)|
| 0:21:34| have the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1294)|
| 0:21:36| to make that statement publicly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1296)|
| 0:21:38| yesterday at this rally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1298)|
| 0:21:40| but I wanted to let my constituents know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1300)|
| 0:21:43| that this is where I stand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1303)|
| 0:21:46| on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1306)|

| 0:22:38| I don't know if anyone wants to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1358)|
| 0:22:40| to anything that's on the consent calendar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1360)|
| 0:22:42| today coming from the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1362)|
| 0:22:45| I know that it's a normal practice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1365)|
| 0:22:47| for the superintendent of schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1367)|
| 0:22:49| Dr. James P. McIntyre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1369)|

| 0:23:07| to Boston College.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1387)|
| 0:23:08| And I think we in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1388)|
| 0:23:10| need to pause for a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1390)|
| 0:23:12| and say, hmm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1392)|
| 0:23:13| these people have put in a lot of work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1393)|
| 0:23:16| in education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1396)|

| 0:23:21| Anything else on the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1401)|
| 0:23:22| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1402)|
| 0:23:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1403)|
| 0:23:24| This is Ordinance 11-5-104| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1404)|
| 0:23:27| dealing with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1407)|
| 0:23:29| I'll summarize it very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1409)|
| 0:23:31| The fee office is submitting a budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1411)|
| 0:23:33| I talked to the mayor this morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1413)|
| 0:23:34| and he was pretty much okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1414)|
| 0:23:36| to go ahead with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1416)|
| 0:23:37| But I did talk to the deputy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1417)|
| 0:23:39| from the Register of the Deeds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1419)|
| 0:23:43| and they asked that I put it off for a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1423)|
| 0:23:45| So we'll defer this one more month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1425)|
| 0:23:46| And I'm almost certain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1426)|
| 0:23:47| that we'll be to the point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1427)|
| 0:23:49| where we can bring this forward next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1429)|
| 0:23:51| So O-11-5-104,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1431)|
| 0:23:53| deferred for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1433)|
| 0:23:54| Anything else on the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1434)|
| 0:23:56| Do I hear a motion that we add| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1436)|
| 0:23:57| what needed to be added,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1437)|
| 0:23:58| delete what needs to be deleted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1438)|
| 0:23:59| and move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1439)|
| 0:24:01| Make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=1441)|

| 0:34:42| nevertheless Drug Court is alive and well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2082)|
| 0:34:44| and we ask you to continue your support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2084)|
| 0:34:47| thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2087)|
| 0:34:48| point of order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2088)|
| 0:34:49| I need a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2089)|
| 0:34:50| make a motion to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2090)|
| 0:34:53| is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2093)|
| 0:34:54| second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2094)|
| 0:34:55| thank you Judge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2095)|
| 0:34:56| Judge Cerny| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2096)|
| 0:34:58| thank you for hearing us today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2098)|
| 0:35:00| and Commissioner Broyles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2100)|
| 0:35:02| forgive me if I kind of co-opt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2102)|
| 0:35:04| one of the things that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2104)|
| 0:35:06| you have already expressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2106)|
| 0:35:08| to this board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2108)|
| 0:35:10| I think the inherent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2110)|
| 0:35:12| worth and dignity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2112)|
| 0:35:14| of individual human beings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2114)|
| 0:35:16| is something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2116)|
| 0:35:19| we support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2119)|
| 0:35:22| vigorously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2122)|
| 0:35:23| at Drug Court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2123)|
| 0:35:24| and the inherent worth and dignity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2124)|
| 0:35:26| of persons who are battling with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2126)|
| 0:35:28| various kinds of addictions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2128)|
| 0:35:30| is something that Drug Court has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2130)|
| 0:35:32| worked for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2132)|
| 0:35:33| a long period of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2133)|
| 0:35:35| to help people with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2135)|
| 0:35:37| and of course it's obvious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2137)|
| 0:35:38| or perhaps it's obvious to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2138)|
| 0:35:40| because I've learned these things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2140)|
| 0:35:42| lately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2142)|
| 0:35:43| the individuals that we're referring to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2143)|
| 0:35:46| are persons involved with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2146)|
| 0:35:47| the criminal justice system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2147)|
| 0:35:49| who choose to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2149)|
| 0:35:51| come away from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2151)|
| 0:35:53| the normal progression| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2153)|
| 0:35:54| in the criminal justice system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2154)|
| 0:35:55| for the purpose of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2155)|
| 0:35:56| subjecting themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2156)|
| 0:35:57| to a somewhat more rigorous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2157)|
| 0:35:59| program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2159)|
| 0:36:01| not unlike probation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2161)|
| 0:36:02| but quite a bit more intensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2162)|
| 0:36:04| so that these persons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2164)|
| 0:36:06| can actively engage in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2166)|
| 0:36:08| seeking out a better way of living| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2168)|
| 0:36:10| with the aid of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2170)|
| 0:36:12| for example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2172)|
| 0:36:14| the Drug Court professionals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2174)|
| 0:36:16| and the criminal court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2176)|
| 0:36:18| supervisory role| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2178)|
| 0:36:19| and of course I've had the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2179)|
| 0:36:21| honor of being associated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2181)|
| 0:36:23| with the Drug Court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2183)|
| 0:36:25| pursuant to Judge McGee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2185)|
| 0:36:26| and Judge Leibowitz's request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2186)|
| 0:36:29| we had heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2189)|
| 0:36:31| that this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2191)|
| 0:36:33| wanted to have some questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2193)|
| 0:36:35| answered about what's going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2195)|
| 0:36:37| with Drug Court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2197)|
| 0:36:38| what the status is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2198)|
| 0:36:39| and those sorts of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2199)|
| 0:36:41| before approving a lease agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2201)|
| 0:36:43| let me just address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2203)|
| 0:36:45| very briefly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2205)|
| 0:36:46| or try to be brief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2206)|
| 0:36:47| one of my weaknesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2207)|
| 0:36:49| as a person I'm sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2209)|
| 0:36:50| is long-windedness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2210)|
| 0:36:51| so please forgive me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2211)|
| 0:36:52| and Commissioner Hammond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2212)|
| 0:36:54| if I notice you doing this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2214)|
| 0:36:56| I'll realize that perhaps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2216)|
| 0:36:57| I ought to take a seat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2217)|
| 0:36:59| or just answer your questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2219)|
| 0:37:01| but this resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2221)|
| 0:37:03| to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2223)|
| 0:37:05| an amendment to a lease agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2225)|
| 0:37:07| is something that I would urge you to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2227)|
| 0:37:09| and the Drug Court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2229)|
| 0:37:12| has sought for County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2232)|
| 0:37:14| to expend some dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2234)|
| 0:37:17| to rehabilitate a particular facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2237)|
| 0:37:20| on the assumption| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2240)|
| 0:37:22| that we would be able to go forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2242)|
| 0:37:24| to provide a residential facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2244)|
| 0:37:27| for Drug Court participants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2247)|
| 0:37:29| the Drug Court Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2249)|
| 0:37:31| has thought better of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2251)|
| 0:37:32| and we've reconsidered that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2252)|
| 0:37:34| and that's not something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2254)|
| 0:37:36| that we would ask you for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2256)|
| 0:37:37| so essentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2257)|
| 0:37:38| and I think that you may have already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2258)|
| 0:37:40| handled this issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2260)|
| 0:37:41| we're not going to be seeking monies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2261)|
| 0:37:43| from the County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2263)|
| 0:37:44| to create an inpatient facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2264)|
| 0:37:48| or go forward with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2268)|
| 0:37:51| residential treatment programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2271)|
| 0:37:53| we are using agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2273)|
| 0:37:55| in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2275)|
| 0:37:56| that are able to provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2276)|
| 0:37:57| halfway houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2277)|
| 0:37:59| halfway housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2279)|
| 0:38:01| or housing for participants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2281)|
| 0:38:03| when that's needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2283)|
| 0:38:04| and so as a result| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2284)|
| 0:38:06| that's no longer desired| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2286)|
| 0:38:08| or we're not seeking that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2288)|
| 0:38:11| as a result| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2291)|
| 0:38:12| we have been using| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2292)|
| 0:38:15| a month-to-month tenancy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2295)|
| 0:38:16| with the provider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2296)|
| 0:38:18| that leases Drug Court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2298)|
| 0:38:20| the space that we have been using| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2300)|
| 0:38:22| now we are able to sign a lease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2302)|
| 0:38:24| and I think in fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2304)|
| 0:38:25| that the lease is ready| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2305)|
| 0:38:28| and the amendments to the lease are ready| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2308)|
| 0:38:30| we are able to save| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2310)|
| 0:38:32| a significant amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2312)|
| 0:38:33| each month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2313)|
| 0:38:34| by signing the lease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2314)|
| 0:38:35| the landlord was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2315)|
| 0:38:38| charging a higher rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2318)|
| 0:38:40| based on the uncertainty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2320)|
| 0:38:41| of having a month-to-month tenancy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2321)|
| 0:38:43| and so as a result| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2323)|
| 0:38:44| signing the lease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2324)|
| 0:38:45| is a very good idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2325)|
| 0:38:46| it's very good fiscally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2326)|
| 0:38:48| I think that we save| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2328)|
| 0:38:49| a good bit of money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2329)|
| 0:38:50| and our executive director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2330)|
| 0:38:51| Ron Hanover| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2331)|
| 0:38:52| is here to answer those questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2332)|
| 0:38:54| more specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2334)|
| 0:38:55| if you want to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2335)|
| 0:38:56| how much is being saved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2336)|
| 0:38:57| as a result of signing the lease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2337)|
| 0:38:59| so I would urge your approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2339)|
| 0:39:01| of this resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2341)|
| 0:39:03| and then separate and apart| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2343)|
| 0:39:06| from that recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2346)|
| 0:39:07| I'm here to answer any questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2347)|
| 0:39:09| that you may have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2349)|
| 0:39:10| and I'll do the best that I can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2350)|
| 0:39:11| with respect to my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2351)|
| 0:39:13| humble abilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2353)|
| 0:39:16| and then I may have to defer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2356)|
| 0:39:17| questions to executive director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2357)|
| 0:39:20| Ron Hanover| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2360)|
| 0:39:21| who has been running| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2361)|
| 0:39:24| the Drug Court operations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2364)|
| 0:39:25| from day to day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2365)|
| 0:39:27| let me just point out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2367)|
| 0:39:28| if I could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2368)|
| 0:39:29| Drug Court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2369)|

| 0:39:31| across the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2371)|

| 0:39:33| a creature of statute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2373)|

| 0:39:38| can create drug courts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2378)|
| 0:39:41| and then at that point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2381)|
| 0:39:43| my understanding is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2383)|
| 0:39:45| that the funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2385)|

| 0:39:59| with the office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2399)|
| 0:40:00| of criminal justice programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2400)|
| 0:40:01| for the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2401)|
| 0:40:02| to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2402)|
| 0:40:03| that our drug court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2403)|

| 0:40:11| are supposed to comply with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2411)|
| 0:40:12| and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2412)|

| 0:41:20| I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2480)|

| 0:41:30| best neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2490)|
| 0:41:31| that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2491)|
| 0:41:32| and they do a great job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2492)|
| 0:41:34| but my concern is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2494)|
| 0:41:36| as I've been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2496)|
| 0:41:37| looking into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2497)|
| 0:41:38| drug courts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2498)|
| 0:41:39| and these programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2499)|
| 0:41:40| is that there just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2500)|
| 0:41:41| don't seem to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2501)|
| 0:41:42| enough beds available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2502)|
| 0:41:43| for people who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2503)|
| 0:41:45| want to participate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2505)|
| 0:41:47| that sometimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2507)|
| 0:41:48| there's a waiting list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2508)|
| 0:41:49| of up to six weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2509)|
| 0:41:50| and by that time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2510)|
| 0:41:51| the person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2511)|
| 0:41:52| you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2512)|

| 0:41:54| be interested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2514)|
| 0:41:55| in pursuing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2515)|
| 0:41:57| and I really think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2517)|
| 0:41:58| there's a tremendous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2518)|
| 0:41:59| need for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2519)|
| 0:42:00| beds for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2520)|
| 0:42:01| young mothers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2521)|
| 0:42:02| so that they can get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2522)|
| 0:42:03| treated and get back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2523)|
| 0:42:04| to their families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2524)|
| 0:42:05| and also it seems to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2525)|
| 0:42:07| to be a rise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2527)|
| 0:42:08| in the number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2528)|
| 0:42:09| of pregnant women| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2529)|
| 0:42:11| and I don't see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2531)|

| 0:42:19| drug problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2539)|
| 0:42:20| and can benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2540)|
| 0:42:21| from drug courts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2541)|
| 0:42:22| so do you all have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2542)|
| 0:42:24| any kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2544)|
| 0:42:25| long range plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=2545)|

| 1:02:40| alludes me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=3760)|

| 1:02:42| I've been on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=3762)|

| 1:02:44| I wouldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=3764)|
| 1:02:45| there's parts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=3765)|
| 1:02:46| of it I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=3766)|
| 1:02:47| wouldn't build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=3767)|
| 1:02:48| a dog pen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=3768)|
| 1:02:49| on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=3769)|
| 1:02:50| I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=3770)|
| 1:02:51| I'm quite| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=3771)|
| 1:02:52| frank with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=3772)|
| 1:02:53| you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=3773)|
| 1:02:54| In N.R.T.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=3774)|
| 1:02:55| whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=3775)|
| 1:02:56| they are out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=3776)|
| 1:02:57| there, what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=3777)|
| 1:02:58| I understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=3778)|
| 1:02:59| is it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=3779)|
| 1:03:00| interesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=3780)|
| 1:03:01| in buying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=3781)|
| 1:03:02| and continuing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=3782)|
| 1:03:03| We have an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=3783)|
| 1:03:04| appraisal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=3784)|
| 1:03:05| on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=3785)|
| 1:03:06| property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=3786)|
| 1:03:07| Have they been approached about the appraisal price, Hugh, on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=3787)|
| 1:03:12| Yes, I need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=3792)|
| 1:03:14| I misspoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=3794)|
| 1:03:15| It's $1.19 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=3795)|
| 1:03:17| $1.19?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=3797)|
| 1:03:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=3798)|
| 1:03:19| They're aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=3799)|
| 1:03:22| Well, if it goes to auction, then they've got to be the highest bidder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=3802)|
| 1:03:31| So, to me, we'd be better off taking our chances because I know they want to get in the mix on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=3811)|
| 1:03:37| and I feel like they'll bid it to get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=3817)|
| 1:03:41| I mean, it's not going to be a sealed bid, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=3821)|
| 1:03:43| It's going to be an open auction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=3823)|
| 1:03:45| It'll be a public auction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=3825)|
| 1:03:46| Public auction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=3826)|
| 1:03:47| We've been approached by two other operators as well who said they may be interested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=3827)|
| 1:03:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=3832)|
| 1:03:54| So, you know, what drives the price is how bad somebody wants it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=3834)|
| 1:04:04| You have a company that's already established there, which we've had a little bit of a misunderstanding with in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=3844)|
| 1:04:14| But if they're willing to go the mile on it to keep from having to move and find a new place and all of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=3854)|
| 1:04:23| you know, with all of this storm damage in the last month, I'm sure that they've got enough built up out there to last a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=3863)|
| 1:04:31| They're not going to have to worry about looking for extra limbs to grind in July and August| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=3871)|
| 1:04:37| because they're probably still going to be grinding April's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=3877)|
| 1:04:41| But I don't feel like we're going to be saving ourselves anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=3881)|
| 1:04:44| or making any more money for the taxpayers by saying, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=3884)|
| 1:04:48| let's wait and have somebody look at it and see what it's worth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=3888)|
| 1:04:52| I think that somebody in that business is going to give us the most money for what it's worth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=3892)|
| 1:04:57| because it's going to be worth that to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=3897)|
| 1:04:59| And that's my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=3899)|
| 1:05:01| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=3901)|
| 1:05:03| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=3903)|
| 1:05:04| I tend to agree with Commissioner Andrews and Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=3904)|
| 1:05:08| And I encourage anyone who has not gone to the property to go there because there are access issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=3908)|
| 1:05:16| I mean, if you're looking for land on Pellissippi Parkway for some kind of development, that probably is not it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=3916)|
| 1:05:22| I think the value in that land lies in, I forgot how many acres the concrete, how much on concrete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=3922)|
| 1:05:30| It's like acres of concrete poured, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=3930)|
| 1:05:33| I mean, you know, five or six acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=3933)|
| 1:05:35| So that's the value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=3935)|
| 1:05:36| I mean, I think we've already proven that places of it won't hold water, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=3936)|
| 1:05:43| So you're not going to tear it down and start building on something that's suspect as best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=3943)|
| 1:05:49| And that region, even on Pellissippi, has had issues with dropouts, sinkholes, whatever you want to call them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=3949)|
| 1:05:58| So I'm for letting this process go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=3958)|
| 1:06:02| I don't know if I'm in favor of doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=3962)|
| 1:06:05| Regardless, if someone does want to come and bust the concrete up and start something else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=3965)|
| 1:06:11| there's going to be an MPC process that's going to come to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=3971)|
| 1:06:14| I mean, you know, if they want to reuse it, we're going to hear about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=3974)|
| 1:06:17| We're going to hear all about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=3977)|
| 1:06:18| MPC is going to hear all about it and we're going to get their recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=3978)|
| 1:06:21| So I think we just need to let this play out and see what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=3981)|
| 1:06:27| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=3987)|
| 1:06:29| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=3989)|
| 1:06:30| Then looking at the motion that's before us as to wait 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=3990)|
| 1:06:37| or ask for additional information in the next 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=3997)|
| 1:06:41| Approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4001)|
| 1:06:42| The motion is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4002)|
| 1:06:43| I thought it was amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4003)|
| 1:06:44| I thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4004)|
| 1:06:48| I was asking Dr. Briggs about the feasibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4008)|
| 1:06:53| If he would be comfortable amending it to say they come back to us with a recommendation in 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4013)|
| 1:06:58| It's his motion, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4018)|
| 1:07:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4021)|
| 1:07:02| To pause for just a second on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4022)|
| 1:07:05| While we're then discussing whether to approve or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4025)|
| 1:07:08| the question that we have before us may also include whether or not it may have a higher and better use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4028)|
| 1:07:16| And if we're going to ask Hugh Holt whether he thinks it has a better and higher use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4036)|
| 1:07:24| could not committing yourself, Mr. Holt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4044)|
| 1:07:27| but what would you think the process might be of looking for subdividing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4047)|
| 1:07:35| or is that something that you think we should tackle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4055)|
| 1:07:40| I started this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4060)|
| 1:07:42| It's been over a week ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4062)|
| 1:07:44| and I should have some information within the next two weeks doing an investigation just as Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4064)|
| 1:07:52| or Commissioner Briggs spoke of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4072)|
| 1:07:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4074)|
| 1:07:56| What's your opinion of what's before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4076)|
| 1:07:59| The discussion, just entering into the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4079)|
| 1:08:02| Commissioner, really, from the solid waste standpoint, we want to focus on the operation of the convenience centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4082)|
| 1:08:08| I don't know that we're in any way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4088)|
| 1:08:10| I meant the value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4090)|
| 1:08:11| I'm just speaking of the value of the property as it sits today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4091)|
| 1:08:15| And, again, I just feel completely unqualified to give you any kind of meaningful opinion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4095)|
| 1:08:21| And, Mr. King, what are you standing out there for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4101)|
| 1:08:25| Waiting his turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4105)|
| 1:08:29| I've just got their back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4109)|
| 1:08:31| Quick, I only have 30 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4111)|
| 1:08:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4113)|
| 1:08:34| On behalf of NRR, who's the current operator on the premises,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4114)|
| 1:08:40| obviously we have our preference about going forward in this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4120)|
| 1:08:45| But what I wanted to make clear was really two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4125)|
| 1:08:50| Number one, if you go forward right now and proceed to sell it and sell it as fast as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4130)|
| 1:08:55| that suits us fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4135)|
| 1:08:56| If you are, in fact, going to delay the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4136)|
| 1:09:00| and arguably put it to the point where this contract that we have comes to its termination date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4140)|
| 1:09:07| then we would ask that the county enter into extensions month to month of that contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4147)|
| 1:09:14| until such time as the property is sold so we can continue to operate there, produce money to the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4154)|
| 1:09:20| and at the same time provide a service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4160)|
| 1:09:22| If we're not going to do it there, ultimately we want to be doing it somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4162)|
| 1:09:26| But for now, while we are there, we'd like to be able to continue until that property is, in fact, sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4166)|
| 1:09:31| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4171)|
| 1:09:32| One other point relevant to the value about the use of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4172)|
| 1:09:37| I've got my own views about what a rezoning would do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4177)|
| 1:09:41| I do not think it would operate to increase the value based upon my belief and understanding as to what MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4181)|
| 1:09:51| the recommending authority on any rezoning would be likely to recommend as to this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4191)|
| 1:09:56| And I don't think that's going to help it any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4196)|
| 1:10:00| The value given by the appraiser is based on certain assumptions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4200)|
| 1:10:04| and one of those assumptions is that a portion of it be rezoned so that 1,000,001 plus figure may not be all and end all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4204)|
| 1:10:17| There are differing views on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4217)|
| 1:10:19| Once again, a public auction will determine that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4219)|
| 1:10:22| As to parceling the property, I would simply observe that that produces, in and of itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4222)|
| 1:10:28| certain practical and legal issues relative to access onto the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4228)|
| 1:10:36| This property is actually two parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4236)|
| 1:10:38| The current access is a driveway, et cetera, and if you start parceling this out some way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4238)|
| 1:10:44| somehow you're going to have to provide access to all those other properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4244)|
| 1:10:46| And I'm not saying it can't be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4246)|
| 1:10:50| As a nation of lawyers, there's probably a way to get it done, but it would take a considerable amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4250)|
| 1:10:54| And I think that's part of the things that they can look at and determine and make a decision about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4254)|
| 1:11:01| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4261)|
| 1:11:02| I appreciate the time for those to answer my questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4262)|
| 1:11:06| I am comfortable, I think I would be comfortable with if we wanted to wait 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4266)|
| 1:11:12| to get a more firm recommendation of whatever they think it might be worth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4272)|
| 1:11:16| because the value of the property, we do need to get the best value of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4276)|
| 1:11:22| But I'd also want you to know that I'm comfortable with voting today to say that we're going to put it up for auction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4282)|
| 1:11:30| and that natural resource recovery can stay there until such time as it's sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4290)|
| 1:11:37| The motion on the floor is to request a review of possible rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4297)|
| 1:11:42| It's not for 30 days, so unless there's a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4302)|
| 1:11:46| I don't know what the motion is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4306)|
| 1:11:49| The motion is to request that purchasing and engineering review the possible rezoning of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4309)|
| 1:11:55| and determine the highest and best use of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4315)|
| 1:11:57| So there's nothing here in this motion that says 30-day delay or bring us back in 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4317)|
| 1:12:02| I just, unless somebody wants to make a substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4322)|
| 1:12:04| We'll have to make a substitute motion to add the 30 days to it then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4324)|
| 1:12:07| I'll agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4327)|
| 1:12:08| I would agree to that, because right now we just don't have enough information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4328)|
| 1:12:12| If we pass the resolution and say we're going to do this, then they'll do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4332)|
| 1:12:16| But I think if they come back to us and say, you know, this is not a good idea, let's just move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4336)|
| 1:12:22| So you're.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4342)|
| 1:12:23| I'll second his.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4343)|
| 1:12:26| Well, you can take it as an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4346)|
| 1:12:27| I'll take it as an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4347)|
| 1:12:29| Okay, so there will be a 30-day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4349)|
| 1:12:31| Or you'll come back to us in 30 days and you feel comfortable doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4351)|
| 1:12:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4354)|
| 1:12:35| Mike, I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4355)|
| 1:12:36| Haven't we already voted to allow NRR to remain on the property until it's sold?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4356)|
| 1:12:43| Did we do that last month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4363)|
| 1:12:45| No, we voted to sell it at auction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4365)|
| 1:12:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4368)|
| 1:12:49| I just remember in the discussion there being that we were going to permit them to stay on until it's sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4369)|
| 1:12:55| So we have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4375)|
| 1:12:57| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4377)|
| 1:12:58| Commissioner Briggs had his let on first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4378)|
| 1:13:00| No, I just wanted to explain when you say you break it up into different parcels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4380)|
| 1:13:05| or somebody will have to come in there and bust up 10 acres of concrete,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4385)|
| 1:13:09| what I would envision is that when you draw your plots up is that you would draw a plot up is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4389)|
| 1:13:15| where that portion of the facility where the pad and all of that is remains in such a way that it could be used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4395)|
| 1:13:23| as a mulch facility because then you would have these different companies that want to continue it as a mulch facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4403)|
| 1:13:30| and they'd be bidding against each other for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4410)|
| 1:13:32| And then the rest of the property we would, and this is what I don't have the answer to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4412)|
| 1:13:36| would be plotted so it could be zoned else, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4416)|
| 1:13:41| it could be zoned otherwise and see if you would have additional value on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4421)|
| 1:13:45| There was a couple of other comments I'd like to make is that people talk about the lack of development along the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4425)|
| 1:13:50| Pellissippi Parkway and I may be wrong on this because it may have changed and maybe Mr. King could help us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4430)|
| 1:13:56| Part of the reason that that's had difficulty developing is that it's zoned where I think it was a technological corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4436)|
| 1:14:03| and that's caused problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4443)|
| 1:14:05| So just because there's not been development there over the last 20 or 25 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4445)|
| 1:14:09| part of it is because of the restrictions of that zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4449)|
| 1:14:12| I believe that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4452)|
| 1:14:14| And also I think that facility will be in the technology corridor too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4454)|
| 1:14:20| Well, it's zoned agricultural now, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4460)|
| 1:14:22| Yeah, but it was previously zoned agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4462)|
| 1:14:24| It will probably be in the corridor, I would imagine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4464)|
| 1:14:27| It is in the corridor because I'd have to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4467)|
| 1:14:31| How do we put a mulching facility in a technological corridor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4471)|
| 1:14:34| It was there before the corridor was there, before the zoning of the corridor was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4474)|
| 1:14:40| In answer to your question, I think you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4480)|
| 1:14:43| The vision of the corridor was a certain type of utilization and it was zoned accordingly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4483)|
| 1:14:50| and a different sort of an approval process has to take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4490)|
| 1:14:53| And, unfortunately, to some degree, that has inhibited some of the development in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4493)|
| 1:14:58| I think that's probably true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4498)|
| 1:15:01| This particular piece, I don't think the corridor issue is not necessarily involved as far as this particular parcel is concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4501)|
| 1:15:10| And, again, back to that idea of parceling, just one other thing is I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4510)|
| 1:15:16| I've covered that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4516)|
| 1:15:17| I don't need to get back into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4517)|
| 1:15:18| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4518)|
| 1:15:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4519)|
| 1:15:21| And you've heard me speak on this before, but, you know, we're getting how much a month off of them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4521)|
| 1:15:26| $6,000 a month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4526)|
| 1:15:27| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4527)|
| 1:15:28| $6,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4528)|
| 1:15:29| When you're looking at it, look at, all right, we've got $6,000 that was coming in every single month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4529)|
| 1:15:34| And if you put it up for auction, do you have a minimum bid that you want to put on there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4534)|
| 1:15:38| Because, I mean, this is an asset the county has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4538)|
| 1:15:41| Do we want to get rid of this asset?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4541)|
| 1:15:43| You know, it's giving us $6,000 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4543)|
| 1:15:45| I mean, we've got to rely on you if this is the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4545)|
| 1:15:49| Or, you know, if it's giving us $6,000 a month, and do we wait another two or three years until the economy picks back even more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4549)|
| 1:15:54| and it brings us more money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4554)|
| 1:15:55| So those are things that we want you to be looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4555)|
| 1:15:58| Most definitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4558)|
| 1:15:59| I am looking at those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4559)|
| 1:16:01| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4561)|
| 1:16:02| Was MPC there just a moment ago to make some statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4562)|
| 1:16:10| The property is not in the overlay in the technology corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4570)|
| 1:16:15| But that didn't make any difference because it's agricultural and mulching in an ag zone is okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4575)|
| 1:16:23| Relative to your point, Commissioner Smith, and the answer is accurate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4583)|
| 1:16:29| the amount that's to be paid to the county is $6,000 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4589)|
| 1:16:35| That's a minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4595)|
| 1:16:37| The last, the preceding three months, that payment exceeded $10,000 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4597)|
| 1:16:44| It was $36,000 or $37,000 for February, March, and April, as I recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4604)|
| 1:16:52| But it is a minimum of six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4612)|
| 1:16:57| The motion on the floor is for the purchasing and for engineering to review the rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4617)|
| 1:17:04| and bring that review back to us at our next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4624)|

| 1:19:33| That concludes our regular agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4773)|
| 1:19:37| Now we're going to discussion items under other business, and this is just for commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4777)|
| 1:19:43| When we talk about other business at our work session, it automatically comes on the agenda for our regular meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4783)|
| 1:19:50| What I'd like to do is if we have a discussion item is let's determine if it needs to be put on the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4790)|
| 1:19:55| because a lot of these we've already taken care of, but what happens is people see these items on the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4795)|
| 1:20:00| and they show up at the meeting today thinking they need to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4800)|
| 1:20:03| So, Jolie, let's you and I discuss the items that need to be brought over to the regular meeting as opposed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4803)|
| 1:20:09| then that way people don't have to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4809)|
| 1:20:11| And, you know, I mean, if they want to spend time with us, we are lovely people, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4811)|
| 1:20:16| With regards to the Hillside and Ridgetop Plan, I attended the City Council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4816)|
| 1:20:20| We are having a joint meeting with City Council June the 9th at 5 o'clock, and that will be here in this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4820)|
| 1:20:28| The economic development that's on the agenda, we've already discussed that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4828)|
| 1:20:31| so unless someone has any particular reason to discuss it, we'll move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4831)|
| 1:20:35| Redistricting, I have talked with Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4835)|
| 1:20:37| I've also talked with Rick Emmett, and I've also talked to Ms. Kin Cannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4837)|
| 1:20:40| We will have our first meeting of the School Board Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4840)|
| 1:20:44| and the Commission Committee to start working redistricting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4844)|
| 1:20:46| That should happen within the next few days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4846)|
| 1:20:49| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4849)|
| 1:20:50| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4850)|
| 1:20:51| At the work session in discussion of that, there was a proposed letter leave commission going to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4851)|
| 1:20:58| that committee or the school board or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4858)|
| 1:21:00| Jolie and I have talked about it, and I'll make my presentation if I feel necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4860)|
| 1:21:05| The concern I had was that I would like to see the 8th District closer to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4865)|
| 1:21:12| or under the average as opposed to closer to or over the average, but we'll see how that works out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4872)|
| 1:21:18| and I'll just present that live verbally whenever those committees meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4878)|
| 1:21:22| And we'll certainly let everyone know when those committees do meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4882)|
| 1:21:24| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4884)|
| 1:21:25| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4885)|
| 1:21:26| I'll just wait until you see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4886)|
| 1:21:29| Mr. Chairman, on this, the Hilltop, is that going to be, we're going to have TV so the public can see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4889)|
| 1:21:33| Oh, yes, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4893)|
| 1:21:34| It will be in this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4894)|
| 1:21:35| It will be June 9th at 5 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4895)|
| 1:21:37| It will be a joint meeting of City Council and County Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4897)|
| 1:21:40| I assumed it was, but I just wanted to let the public know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4900)|
| 1:21:43| And Mr. Bailey, Vice Mayor, and I are meeting in the morning to start talking about how that meeting will function| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4903)|
| 1:21:48| and operate and the issues and so forth, and you'll be in on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4908)|
| 1:21:52| The discussion with regards to the Tennessee County Services Association meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4912)|
| 1:21:56| I took that up unless there's any other legal fees for county commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4916)|
| 1:22:00| Does that need to be brought up again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4920)|
| 1:22:02| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4922)|
| 1:22:03| Okay, so that was already taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4923)|
| 1:22:06| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4926)|
| 1:22:08| Also, there had been a question about the filling of Senator Woodson's position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4928)|
| 1:22:14| I asked the law director to check, and Senator Woodson's official resignation date is July the 9th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4934)|
| 1:22:21| And so, therefore, we have some time before we have our meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4941)|
| 1:22:24| and we are accepting resumes from anyone who would be interested in that interim appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4944)|
| 1:22:28| But as far as our acting, it will probably be at the July meeting, I'm guessing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4948)|
| 1:22:31| because her resignation is not until July 9th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4951)|
| 1:22:36| We are going to talk now about the mayor's proposed budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4956)|
| 1:22:39| and we have a number of people that we've asked to be here to talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4959)|
| 1:22:43| And the first one is the Knox County Trustee's Office is a representative from the Trustee's Office here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4963)|
| 1:22:53| Yes, sir, your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4973)|
| 1:22:55| David Skinner, Knox County Trustee's Office, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4975)|
| 1:23:00| I actually was not prepared to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4980)|
| 1:23:02| I thought John was going to be down here, but in his absence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4982)|
| 1:23:06| Would you like for us to wait, because we have some other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4986)|
| 1:23:08| We could wait a few minutes in case he comes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4988)|
| 1:23:12| Mr. Chairman, we could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4992)|
| 1:23:14| I would suggest that we move him further into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4994)|
| 1:23:16| Let's wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4996)|
| 1:23:17| I mean, we want to give him the courtesy to address this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4997)|
| 1:23:19| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=4999)|
| 1:23:20| The Knox County Property Assessor is Mr. Ballard here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5000)|
| 1:23:27| Mr. Ballard, if you'll give us your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5007)|
| 1:23:29| any comments you'd like to make about your budget, and then we'll have questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5009)|
| 1:23:32| Phil Ballard, Knox County Property Assessor, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5012)|
| 1:23:37| I'm ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5017)|
| 1:23:40| I really don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5020)|
| 1:23:41| I think I'd be better prepared just to go ahead and answer your questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5021)|
| 1:23:45| I have met with the finance department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5025)|
| 1:23:47| I'm satisfied with the budget that we've put together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5027)|
| 1:23:50| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5030)|
| 1:23:51| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5031)|
| 1:23:52| This question is directed to Mr. Ballard, but I want to preface the question with saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5032)|
| 1:23:59| I wish everyone appearing on our agenda or list this afternoon do two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5039)|
| 1:24:05| and a half questions to answer me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5045)|
| 1:24:09| Sir Phil, you do not know what my question is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5049)|
| 1:24:11| You don't know the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5051)|
| 1:24:13| I do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5053)|
| 1:24:14| Just stand there and take a whipping for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5054)|
| 1:24:19| I'm glad I'm first up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5059)|
| 1:24:24| How does this budget compare to this year that we're coming out of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5064)|
| 1:24:31| and how does this budget compare to what you think may happen a year from now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5071)|
| 1:24:37| In other words, won't you take the budget that we're working on right now as proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5077)|
| 1:24:42| which you say is going to be an acceptable budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5082)|
| 1:24:45| I want you to compare it to last, the one right in front of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5085)|
| 1:24:50| and compare it to the one after it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5090)|
| 1:24:52| And the question I'm asking is do you think your budget will go down next year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5092)|
| 1:24:58| And if not, why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5098)|
| 1:25:00| In comparison to last year, you'll note, and without the exact figure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5100)|
| 1:25:04| but I believe it reflects an increase of $448,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5104)|
| 1:25:10| But that's part of the, when you have heard the mayor speak about contra accounts between me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5110)|
| 1:25:17| and the sheriff's department, what that is was grant funded money from the state to employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5117)|
| 1:25:24| In our case, it amounted to nine employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5124)|
| 1:25:27| And when you look at 448, 443,000 of that is to these grant employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5127)|
| 1:25:34| Now, I will say that's been paid for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5134)|
| 1:25:37| One of the people has got 15 years tender in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5137)|
| 1:25:41| And the way that that probably worked, we received a little bit of money from the city on personal property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5141)|
| 1:25:47| We received grant money from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5147)|
| 1:25:50| That was based on 62 cents a parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5150)|
| 1:25:52| As you know, times are really bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5152)|
| 1:25:56| The state has cut that part out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5156)|
| 1:25:58| So we were left with nine employees that we had to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5158)|
| 1:26:03| We also, I have passed out numerous times, at least four among you all, that said, you know, to do our job right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5163)|
| 1:26:10| as the state guideline, you need one person for every 4,500 parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5170)|
| 1:26:14| We've got 211.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5174)|
| 1:26:16| That means we need 47 employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5176)|
| 1:26:20| I'll also say to you that we operate at the lowest parcel cost per inspection in any other county, including smaller counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5180)|
| 1:26:30| Our budget will approach, I think, $3 million this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5190)|
| 1:26:33| Nashville is eight with only 19% more parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5193)|
| 1:26:37| Memphis is $10 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5197)|
| 1:26:40| We are the only one that operates at the minimum or less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5200)|
| 1:26:44| I think if you look at Nashville, they would have a need of 55 employees on that formula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5204)|
| 1:26:49| They have 88.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5209)|
| 1:26:50| Memphis would be 100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5210)|
| 1:26:52| They have 150.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5212)|
| 1:26:54| We are doing it as small in numbers, both budgetary and personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5214)|
| 1:27:05| But the difference is we've taken it out of the account that it's not necessarily been hidden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5225)|
| 1:27:12| but it has not been reflected during the normal budgetary year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5232)|
| 1:27:16| It's been handled as a supplement down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5236)|
| 1:27:23| Near the end of the budget year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5243)|
| 1:27:26| So my increase is not that very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5246)|
| 1:27:29| We've had some increase in postage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5249)|
| 1:27:32| As you know, one of the reasons that we went to a computer system, it had been upgraded since 1989.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5252)|
| 1:27:39| We've made a payment there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5259)|
| 1:27:40| We're paying some training costs there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5260)|
| 1:27:44| So when you look at it, you say, well, what's the difference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5264)|
| 1:27:46| I've taken the rent out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5266)|
| 1:27:47| So we're operating as flat as that you can operate both personnel and per parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5267)|
| 1:27:55| And I think it reflects well of our staff and everybody that's connected to the property assessor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5275)|
| 1:28:04| Did I answer the first part, Mr. Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5284)|
| 1:28:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5287)|
| 1:28:08| And then you asked how it compares to next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5288)|
| 1:28:11| We're looking at several things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5291)|
| 1:28:14| Maybe even going to, we're going to try a couple of teams to go into a four-day work week to cut down on gasoline expense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5294)|
| 1:28:21| and those sorts of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5301)|
| 1:28:23| And I don't know what that will produce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5303)|
| 1:28:25| It's early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5305)|
| 1:28:26| We're just thinking about some other ways maybe to cut costs with technology,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5306)|
| 1:28:30| possibly being in the field four days a week and in the office one day a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5310)|
| 1:28:34| But we've got to have the new system to implement this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5314)|
| 1:28:38| I will say with the new system that you all have helped purchase that we are online,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5318)|
| 1:28:43| had a little problems here and there, but nothing that IT couldn't handle or Dean Lewis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5323)|
| 1:28:48| and our department, we do look and feel comfortable that we can begin using it in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5328)|
| 1:28:56| My greatest hope, you talk about transparency and all like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5336)|
| 1:28:59| is that maybe we can have something out to the public where they can use it from their house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5339)|
| 1:29:04| or the libraries or wherever they have access to the Internet by February or March of the following year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5344)|
| 1:29:12| In comparison to the next year, you know, our highest cost is personnel, transportation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5352)|
| 1:29:20| and really paper, be it postage or the required notices that has to go out in the mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5360)|
| 1:29:28| So I don't look for a great increase in the following year's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5368)|
| 1:29:34| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5374)|
| 1:29:36| Yes, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5376)|
| 1:29:38| Let me ask you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5378)|
| 1:29:39| You know, we're trying to cut everywhere we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5379)|
| 1:29:41| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5381)|
| 1:29:42| I've not run this by you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5382)|
| 1:29:43| I haven't run it by any office holder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5383)|
| 1:29:45| Do you get a travel allowance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5385)|
| 1:29:47| I do get a travel allowance, but without any publicity to it, I cut mine in half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5387)|
| 1:29:54| I've taken a voluntary reduction of $3,600, and I've made it, it's the same as your house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5394)|
| 1:30:00| Where I see you, you see me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5400)|
| 1:30:02| So I've reduced it $300 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5402)|
| 1:30:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5404)|
| 1:30:05| How would you feel about being reimbursed just for what you actually do, spend?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5405)|
| 1:30:10| I'm just asking your opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5410)|
| 1:30:14| Well, I guess that's each individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5414)|
| 1:30:16| I've had experience both ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5416)|
| 1:30:18| Since I was a regional manager, we've had cars, we've had reimbursement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5418)|
| 1:30:23| For no more than what I do, the allowance is a lot better than putting down, keeping up with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5423)|
| 1:30:31| and really you go to your record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5431)|
| 1:30:33| This allowance thing, it's oftentimes businesses out in the general public where you have an office in your home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5433)|
| 1:30:41| You know, it's got a maximum, I think, of $15,000, $17,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5441)|
| 1:30:45| Another thing I don't really want to debate and get into, some of these things that we go to, you know, is that political| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5445)|
| 1:30:51| or is it on the job or whatever?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5451)|
| 1:30:54| So I took the minimum when you subtract out because it's in the income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5454)|
| 1:30:59| Then when you subtract out everything that comes out of that, you know, what is it, $200 a month, 180, 210?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5459)|
| 1:31:06| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5466)|
| 1:31:07| It's very little money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5467)|
| 1:31:08| You all see me where I need to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5468)|
| 1:31:10| I see you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5470)|
| 1:31:11| And that's just my personal preference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5471)|
| 1:31:14| You know, as far as transparency, you know, I mean, that's a different question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5474)|
| 1:31:18| And that's really, I think, indicative between you all and the administration on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5478)|
| 1:31:24| Well, and I appreciate you stepping up and doing that and some other office holders are doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5484)|
| 1:31:28| But as a rule, a lot of office holders, I see that they're pretty much in their office most of the time, most of the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5488)|
| 1:31:34| And we're giving large travel allowances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5494)|
| 1:31:36| And I'm just thinking personally, that's just a way where we can cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5496)|
| 1:31:40| And just like what you said, they're going to a lot of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5500)|
| 1:31:42| But a lot of it, it is political.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5502)|
| 1:31:44| They want to be there and want to be seen at different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5504)|
| 1:31:48| It doesn't have anything to do with the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5508)|
| 1:31:50| I do go out and inspect properties often in my own car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5510)|
| 1:31:54| And I've also, two training trips to Nashville, I use my car at no county expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5514)|
| 1:31:59| Where that you're gone a week and then travel between here and there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5519)|
| 1:32:02| So there's, you know, it's, I think it's on each situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5522)|
| 1:32:06| But you're all trying to determine a group policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5526)|
| 1:32:08| I did that for now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5528)|
| 1:32:10| And something that being under two administrations, when I come in, you know, I come in as commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5530)|
| 1:32:17| and we had the allowance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5537)|
| 1:32:19| Then when I became an office holder, then the administration at that time wanted you to either take a car or allowance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5539)|
| 1:32:26| I chose the allowance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5546)|
| 1:32:28| Now, under this administration, you have another set of rules of what they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5548)|
| 1:32:32| So I sort of hit the middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5552)|
| 1:32:33| I just reduced mine down to $300.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5553)|
| 1:32:36| Well, I appreciate you doing that, Phil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5556)|
| 1:32:38| And you seem to be a leader in a lot of things that you've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5558)|
| 1:32:40| A couple of the other newly elected office holders, they've been the leaders on some of this too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5560)|
| 1:32:45| So I appreciate you stepping forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5565)|
| 1:32:47| And, you know, you look at it, you're as a servant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5567)|
| 1:32:50| You're a servant to the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5570)|
| 1:32:52| How can I save my office and cost the taxpayers as least as I can?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5572)|
| 1:32:56| And I appreciate that stance that you have on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5576)|
| 1:32:58| And John Troyer, I am for hire if you want to put me in your office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5578)|
| 1:33:04| Phil, thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5584)|
| 1:33:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5585)|
| 1:33:06| Thank you very much, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5586)|
| 1:33:07| I see Mr. Duncan here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5587)|
| 1:33:08| So we'll go ahead and move to the trustee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5588)|
| 1:33:20| Mr. Duncan, thank you so much for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5600)|
| 1:33:22| Anything you'd like to tell us about your budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5602)|
| 1:33:24| And we'll see if we have any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5604)|
| 1:33:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5606)|
| 1:33:27| Well, I think I just want to say I appreciate you all giving me the opportunity to stand up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5607)|
| 1:33:31| And I'll be happy to answer any questions here in a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5611)|
| 1:33:34| And I just briefly would like to mention we've requested $253,821.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5614)|
| 1:33:42| This is down from $257,528 last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5622)|
| 1:33:47| And while our number is smaller, it shows a cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5627)|
| 1:33:50| The actual cuts to our office are more substantial than these numbers indicate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5630)|
| 1:33:55| And that's due to our office taking on an additional $70,000 in cost that previously weren't absorbed by our office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5635)|
| 1:34:04| And these costs are due to earlier this year we switched over the way that we do travel allowances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5644)|
| 1:34:12| like we were just talking about, to a straight mileage reimbursement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5652)|
| 1:34:15| So where the money previously came out of our fee and operating account, now they're coming from the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5655)|
| 1:34:22| So on paper this shows an increase in our travel budget when in actuality we're looking at a savings of around $20,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5662)|
| 1:34:31| The other major change was due to a change in our banking service contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5671)|
| 1:34:37| And that took place in June 2010, just before I came into office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5677)|
| 1:34:43| And so the bank now directly bills our office for service fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5683)|
| 1:34:48| And previously under the old way, those costs were reflected in the interest earned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5688)|
| 1:34:54| But now they're coming directly from the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5694)|
| 1:34:58| But I'm very proud of the budget we've set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5698)|
| 1:35:01| And I'm happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5701)|
| 1:35:03| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5703)|
| 1:35:04| John, you've done a fantastic job with what you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5704)|
| 1:35:07| You've impressed me with what you've done the first several months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5707)|
| 1:35:10| You're saying you're getting your travel back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5710)|
| 1:35:12| What is your check?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5712)|
| 1:35:13| How much are you getting for travel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5713)|
| 1:35:15| What does it come out to on average?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5715)|
| 1:35:19| Well, personally, I've chosen up to this point not to turn in any kind of mileage request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5719)|
| 1:35:27| I've just been taking on those expenses myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5727)|
| 1:35:30| But on average, it fluctuates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5730)|
| 1:35:32| There's some in our office, some field auditors that are out in the field meeting with taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5732)|
| 1:35:38| They're in their car all day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5738)|
| 1:35:39| They're covering the county from Coryton to Concord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5739)|
| 1:35:42| And their numbers may be a little higher on average, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5742)|
| 1:35:46| We expect that from them, but from you as an office holder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5746)|
| 1:35:49| So basically, you're not turning anything in for mileage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5749)|
| 1:35:51| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5751)|
| 1:35:52| I haven't to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5752)|
| 1:35:53| And I have done a significant amount of travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5753)|
| 1:35:57| We have satellite offices over the county that I have to get to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5757)|
| 1:36:00| And we're out meeting with taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5760)|
| 1:36:02| And are we paying you, though, for travel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5762)|
| 1:36:05| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5765)|
| 1:36:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5766)|
| 1:36:07| Thank you for being a servant of the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5767)|
| 1:36:10| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5770)|
| 1:36:12| Mr. Duncan, thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5772)|
| 1:36:13| We appreciate you being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5773)|
| 1:36:14| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5774)|
| 1:36:15| Foster Arnett, Knox County Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5775)|
| 1:36:19| Foster, any remarks you'd like to make to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5779)|
| 1:36:22| And we'll see if you have any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5782)|
| 1:36:25| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5785)|
| 1:36:26| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5786)|
| 1:36:27| I will be brief, and hopefully I can answer some of your questions as I address you very briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5787)|
| 1:36:34| But, ladies and gentlemen of the Knox County Commission, it's a pleasure to be here with you today to talk about our budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5794)|
| 1:36:40| and to tell you some of the exciting things that are going on in our proposed budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5800)|
| 1:36:45| If I can't answer any questions, Pat Sullivan, my chief deputy, or Peggy Kane, my finance director, are both here to help us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5805)|
| 1:36:52| First, let me tell you that I'm extremely proud to work with and for the people in my office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5812)|
| 1:36:58| and for the people of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5818)|
| 1:37:00| When I first came into office, we were the largest clerk's office in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5820)|
| 1:37:05| We were bigger than Memphis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5825)|
| 1:37:07| And right now, we're smaller than Memphis, but we're just a little bit bigger than Davidson County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5827)|
| 1:37:12| However, through attrition, we will reduce that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5832)|
| 1:37:15| When I took office, our budget was over $922,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5835)|
| 1:37:20| And because of what I feel are tight fiscal constraints and responsible oversights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5840)|
| 1:37:25| we've reduced our operating budget some $306,000 to this year's budget of less than $616,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5845)|
| 1:37:35| My first day, as you well know, we eliminated paid shopping days, which didn't go over really well with our employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5855)|
| 1:37:42| but that saved us over $26,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5862)|
| 1:37:46| I've eliminated all travel allowances in my office, including mine, which was $8,400 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5866)|
| 1:37:53| I don't take a travel allowance anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5873)|
| 1:37:55| And that saves Knox County taxpayers in excess of $80,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5875)|
| 1:38:00| Because of this tight economy, I understand how important it is to save money at every single turn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5880)|
| 1:38:06| because it's not my money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5886)|
| 1:38:08| It belongs to the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5888)|
| 1:38:11| We separated 33 employees, either through attrition due to retirements, termination, or other reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5891)|
| 1:38:18| We've added 10 people for a total net loss of 23 positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5898)|
| 1:38:22| and have saved Knox County taxpayers over $785,000 in salaried positions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5902)|
| 1:38:28| which includes pay and overall benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5908)|
| 1:38:32| I discontinued what I thought to be frivolous spending, and we've talked about this before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5912)|
| 1:38:37| where we were renting and watering plants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5917)|
| 1:38:40| and we were getting first aid kits that were provided by a private company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5920)|
| 1:38:45| and we've saved the county over $11,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5925)|
| 1:38:48| I'm proud to tell you that because of our physical management of our office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5928)|
| 1:38:53| that we've saved Knox County citizens almost $960,000 of their own money since we took office in 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5933)|
| 1:39:03| We've installed a fingerprint reader system, which we know that our folks are at work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5943)|
| 1:39:08| We've ended the practice of ghost employees as of September 1, 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5948)|
| 1:39:14| We run our office on performance, not on politics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5954)|
| 1:39:18| I have never, ever accepted, nor will I ever accept, a contribution from any of my employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5958)|
| 1:39:25| because in my opinion, that's flat out wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5965)|
| 1:39:29| Our clerks must balance their work every day to the penny,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5969)|
| 1:39:32| and we have audits to make sure that they do the right thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5972)|
