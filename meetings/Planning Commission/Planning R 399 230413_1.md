| 2:48:07| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10087)|
| 2:48:08| One more question I meant to ask of the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10088)|
| 2:48:12| I know not all Taco Bell locations serve breakfast,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10092)|
| 2:48:15| and looking through the design book from Taco Bell, it didn't indicate that they would be serving breakfast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10095)|
| 2:48:20| Will this location serve breakfast?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10100)|
| 2:48:24| At this time, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10104)|
| 2:48:25| At this time, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10105)|
| 2:48:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10106)|
| 2:48:27| Because that goes back to the traffic concern that I had at agenda review as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10107)|
| 2:48:31| But correct me if I'm wrong, staff, I'm going to look for you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10111)|
| 2:48:35| And I apologize, there was a ton of reading, and I don't read all 101 comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10115)|
| 2:48:39| Did the school system submit any concerns with the traffic as it relates to how close it is to the entrance for the school during that peak rush hour of a morning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10119)|
| 2:48:48| Not that I'm aware of, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10128)|
| 2:48:51| I don't think the schools were aware of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10131)|
| 2:48:55| That's one of the issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10135)|
| 2:48:57| If you don't mind, Chairman, I have a question on the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10137)|
| 2:49:00| You know, during the hours of 11 and 1, what do you expect in terms of volume?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10140)|
| 2:49:05| Between 11 and 1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10145)|
| 2:49:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10147)|
| 2:49:08| I don't have a volume of cars, but it accounts for about 23% of the sales of an entire day for Taco Bell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10148)|
| 2:49:15| So between 11 and 1, that's a quarter of their sales, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10155)|
| 2:49:19| Now, getting back to breakfast real quick, that only accounts for 5% of their sales currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10159)|
| 2:49:25| Obviously, McDonald's has a huge stakehold in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10165)|
| 2:49:28| They've been around for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10168)|
| 2:49:29| Taco Bell is trying to move into that direction, but, well, you know, I'm sure it will take another ten years for them to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10169)|
| 2:49:39| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10179)|
| 2:49:40| I distinctly remember reading a comment from a principal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10180)|
| 2:49:44| I made the assumption that it was the principal of Bearden Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10184)|
| 2:49:48| I think it was just someone that worked there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10188)|
| 2:49:50| Just an employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10190)|
| 2:49:53| An employee at the school commented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10193)|
| 2:49:55| I'm trying to find it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10195)|
| 2:49:57| Yeah, there was a principal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10197)|
| 2:49:58| I don't know if it was a principal of Bearden Elementary, but there was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10198)|
| 2:50:02| You know, my comments are not intended to persuade or dissuade any decision here at the moment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10202)|
| 2:50:09| but I do just want to make everyone aware that this is a CG1 designation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10209)|
| 2:50:15| and there are uses that could create potentially more traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10215)|
| 2:50:21| and there are restaurants that could go in here without a drive-through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10221)|
| 2:50:26| and, you know, we could argue whether that makes it more or less walkable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10226)|
| 2:50:31| And then we have this extraordinary circumstance of this windstorm that we're all aware of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10231)|
| 2:50:37| and I think that probably attributed to the sign being blown away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10237)|
| 2:50:45| and then we saw all these volumes of comments in these last few days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10245)|
| 2:50:50| which would lead a reasonable mind to believe that they weren't fully informed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10250)|
| 2:50:54| And while it's not a, I guess it's not a hard, fast rule that you have to put a sign out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10254)|
| 2:51:04| I just think it would be a good, I think it would be a good effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10264)|
| 2:51:10| I would like to encourage Commissioner Roth to maybe take away his motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10270)|
| 2:51:15| and let's pause for 30 days and let folks in the neighborhood get better informed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10275)|
| 2:51:20| and talk through this just a little bit better, because I sense one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10280)|
| 2:51:27| This might be a close vote, and I shouldn't consider that just because it's a close vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10287)|
| 2:51:31| but I am convinced that people are concerned about a lot of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10291)|
| 2:51:36| They do have CG1 by right, but it is special use with a drive-through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10296)|
| 2:51:40| and I'm going to request my colleague, Commissioner Roth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10300)|
| 2:51:46| if he would just consider that, maybe a 30-day postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10306)|
| 2:51:52| Mr. Chairman, while he's considering, in case he were to reconsider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10312)|
| 2:51:57| one question I do have, I'm just giving you time, Jeff, to think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10317)|
| 2:52:01| I'd love to know the Taco Bell on Millertown seems to make up 50% of the entire county sales| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10321)|
| 2:52:07| between the hours of 4 and 11, so if you could pull me that data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10327)|
| 2:52:11| because that one is always backed up, and I'd rather, like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10331)|
| 2:52:15| walk across Interstate 40 at rush hour than sit in that line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10335)|
| 2:52:21| We've got Commissioner Roth in deep thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10341)|
| 2:52:25| You know, in light of the comments that have been made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10345)|
| 2:52:30| and the concerns that we have and hearing from my fellow commissioner over here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10350)|
| 2:52:38| that there are people certainly in the area that weren't aware of what was going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10358)|
| 2:52:43| I will take my motion back, and I'll make a motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10363)|
| 2:52:51| We've got a motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10371)|
| 2:52:54| I will second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10374)|
| 2:52:55| And we've got Commissioner Phillips with a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10375)|
| 2:52:58| I appreciate your extra consideration, Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10378)|
| 2:53:01| Seeing no other likes, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10381)|
| 2:53:04| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10384)|
| 2:53:05| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10385)|
| 2:53:06| The motion carries for a 30-day postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10386)|
| 2:53:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10388)|
| 2:53:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10389)|
| 2:53:10| Mr. Chairman, I have to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10390)|
| 2:53:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10392)|
| 2:53:14| Have a good long weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10394)|
| 2:53:16| Safe travels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10396)|
| 2:53:20| Chairman Hill, I'll be recusing from item number 25 as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10400)|
| 2:53:24| Thank you, Commissioner Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10404)|
| 2:53:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10406)|
| 2:53:28| We'll move on to agenda item 25,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10408)|
| 2:53:31| Applicant Huber Properties, LLC, location west side of Fritz Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10411)|
| 2:53:36| south of North Campbell Station Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10416)|
| 2:53:39| Tract information is 12.89 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10419)|
| 2:53:43| Present plan designation and zoning is Ag Hillside Protection, Ag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10423)|
| 2:53:48| Proposed plan designation and zoning is low-density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10428)|
| 2:53:52| Hillside Protection, and planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10432)|
| 2:53:55| Existing land use is rural residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10435)|
| 2:53:58| Density proposed up to five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10438)|
| 2:54:03| This is going to require two motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10443)|
| 2:54:07| First motion, staff recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10447)|
| 2:54:08| approve the sector plan amendment to LDR and Hillside Protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10448)|
| 2:54:12| because it's consistent with changing conditions and development in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10452)|
| 2:54:17| Motion two, staff recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10457)|
| 2:54:19| approve the planned residential zone up to five dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10459)|
| 2:54:23| because it is consistent with changing conditions and surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10463)|
| 2:54:27| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10467)|
| 2:54:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10470)|
| 2:54:31| Mr. King, do we have any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10471)|
| 2:54:36| We have opposition on Zoom, I'm being told.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10476)|
| 2:54:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10480)|
| 2:54:41| Would you like to proceed or defer, Councillor King?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10481)|
| 2:54:45| I guess I'll defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10485)|
| 2:54:47| You guess not to defer or you will defer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10487)|
| 2:54:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10491)|
| 2:54:52| Okay. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10492)|
| 2:54:53| So let's move on to the opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10493)|
| 2:54:57| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10497)|
| 2:54:58| Can everyone hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10498)|
| 2:54:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10499)|
| 2:55:01| Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10501)|
| 2:55:03| My name is Art Trebedi, 12134 Woodhollow Lane, Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10503)|
| 2:55:07| and I am the president of the Brandywine Homeowners Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10507)|
| 2:55:12| We are a quiet and long-term community in Northwest County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10512)|
| 2:55:15| just south of and abutting the proposed development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10515)|
| 2:55:19| Our community realized that there was a potential for more development in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10519)|
| 2:55:23| wake of estate changes in the recent past with this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10523)|
| 2:55:28| How much more development was and is the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10528)|
| 2:55:32| We have seen tremendous growth in Northwest County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10532)|
| 2:55:35| Two large DR Horton communities have been developed to our south and west| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10535)|
| 2:55:39| along Fretz Road and Hatmaker Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10539)|
| 2:55:41| At the end of Hatmaker Lane, yet another development is underway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10541)|
| 2:55:45| Additional tracts of land remain in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10545)|
| 2:55:49| and given the nature of our free market economy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10549)|
| 2:55:52| there is sound reason to believe that enterprising developers will continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10552)|
| 2:55:57| their endeavors to bring more rooftops to the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10557)|
| 2:56:00| However,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10560)|
| 2:56:01| what is concerning is the planning and consideration for the impact on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10561)|
| 2:56:06| area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10566)|
| 2:56:07| Here are several examples. Traffic continues to grow in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10567)|
| 2:56:12| According to the Knoxville TPO, Transportation and Planning Organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10572)|
| 2:56:16| the average daily traffic count has doubled in the last 20 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10576)|
| 2:56:22| north of the intersection of Snyder and North Campbell Station,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10582)|

| 2:56:30| The pace of growth over the whole term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10590)|
| 2:56:32| 3.2% has continued to edge up since 2016 and through 2021,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10592)|

| 2:57:00| Is this progress? Perhaps it is, but not without consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10620)|
| 2:57:04| Second, given the condition of the roads in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10624)|
| 2:57:07| both in terms of size and quality, this is unsustainable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10627)|
| 2:57:10| Even today with more development and growing traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10630)|
| 2:57:14| it seems untenable in the future. Something must be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10634)|
| 2:57:18| Moreover, specific to the proposed development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10638)|
| 2:57:21| the intersection of Frentz and North Campbell Station has become a safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10641)|

| 2:57:49| Another chief concern is on Frentz. How will ingress and egress work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10669)|
| 2:57:53| Will the allowed passage to the property be safe for the new residents as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10673)|
| 2:57:57| well as for existing residents passing by?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10677)|
| 2:58:00| We don't even know how many homes will be permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10680)|
| 2:58:04| That begs the question. Do we have the cart before the horse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10684)|
| 2:58:08| the manicured lawn before the house on the hill? Number four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10688)|
| 2:58:11| what about water runoff management? We've seen no plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10691)|
| 2:58:14| We have no indication of a solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10694)|
| 2:58:17| The low points on Frentz already have ponding water and create unnecessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10697)|
| 2:58:20| safety issues. Overall, what is the environmental impact?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10700)|
| 2:58:25| Number five, what is the impact on quality of life?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10705)|
| 2:58:29| This is difficult to enumerate, but there is an impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10709)|
| 2:58:33| In summary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10713)|
| 2:58:34| given the limited details provided as part of the application for plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10714)|
| 2:58:38| amendment and rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10718)|
| 2:58:39| the Brandywine HOA cannot in good conscience support the current development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10719)|
| 2:58:43| as it is and as it's represented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10723)|
| 2:58:46| We stand opposed not out of anger or ill will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10726)|
| 2:58:50| Let me reiterate this, and this is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10730)|
| 2:58:53| We stand opposed not out of anger or ill will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10733)|
| 2:58:55| Rather,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10735)|
| 2:58:56| we stand opposed because there appears to be little data or information to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10736)|
| 2:58:59| put at ease the minds of our homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10739)|
| 2:59:02| The staff report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10742)|
| 2:59:03| which recommends approval of both the plan amendment and rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10743)|
| 2:59:06| referenced that quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10746)|

| 2:59:15| We asked by when, before or after someone is hurt or worse yet killed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10755)|
| 2:59:21| Let's not let it come to that. Let's plan, then act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10761)|
| 2:59:25| Just because it fits the current protocols,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10765)|
| 2:59:27| it doesn't make it right without needed improvements made first or concurrent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10767)|
| 2:59:31| to any new development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10771)|
| 2:59:33| Furthermore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10773)|
| 2:59:34| more information about the development needs to be made public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10774)|
| 2:59:37| So at the very least we ask for a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10777)|
| 2:59:39| And in the very worst case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10779)|
| 2:59:41| we ask that the planning commission commission vote no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10781)|
| 2:59:45| Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10785)|
| 2:59:46| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10786)|
| 2:59:49| Councilor King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10789)|
| 2:59:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10796)|
| 2:59:58| Maybe one of the things I heard from opposition related to traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10798)|
| 3:00:08| was North Campbell Station and Fretz Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10808)|
| 3:00:13| but traffic in that general area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10813)|
| 3:00:17| I know that engineering has been aware of that and has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10817)|
| 3:00:25| already undertaken efforts to make changes and improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10825)|
| 3:00:31| Somewhat discussed at the agenda review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10831)|
| 3:00:34| but I'd like to just go ahead and call on county engineering to give us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10834)|
| 3:00:42| an answer about the traffic situation and timing on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10842)|
| 3:00:48| that sort of thing, rather than listening to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10848)|
| 3:00:51| listen to engineering on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10851)|
| 3:00:55| Yes, sir. Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10855)|
| 3:00:57| Yeah, commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10857)|
| 3:00:58| We have a design contract with Robert G.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10858)|
| 3:01:02| Campbell that we're in the process now of constructing a two way left turn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10862)|
| 3:01:08| lane from Fretz Road to the south to I can't think of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10868)|
| 3:01:13| It's a smaller subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10873)|
| 3:01:15| So we do have a project underway to build a three line section through that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10875)|
| 3:01:19| corridor that would allow for safer left turn access onto Fretz Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10879)|
| 3:01:25| We hope to have a couple eight tracks right away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10885)|
| 3:01:28| We have to acquire and once those will be approved by county commission this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10888)|
| 3:01:33| month and our hope is to have the improvement under construction in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10893)|
| 3:01:39| late summer and either complete the fall of this year or no later than the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10899)|
| 3:01:44| spring of next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10904)|
| 3:01:49| I don't think I probably need to add anything to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10909)|
| 3:01:53| What the staff analysis shows is that they're made a recommendation to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10913)|
| 3:02:01| approve LDR because it's consistent with changing conditions and development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10921)|
| 3:02:07| in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10927)|
| 3:02:10| I think since the northwest sector plan had been adopted back in about 19,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10930)|
| 3:02:19| excuse me, 2016, there's been a lot of development since then and their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10939)|
| 3:02:29| recommendation outlines the nature of the additional development and that it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10949)|
| 3:02:39| shows a tendency, if you will, not to use this property in any kind of an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10959)|
| 3:02:47| agricultural undertaking but signifies it's more for development of low density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10967)|
| 3:02:57| residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10977)|
| 3:02:59| So they have recommended approval as far as the plan is concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10979)|
| 3:03:10| I don't know quality of life is in my view really an individual reaction and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10990)|
| 3:03:24| don't know how to comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11004)|
| 3:03:26| Their suggestions or observations about quality of life, I say every day when I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11006)|
| 3:03:35| see a sunny day like we've had recently here in Knoxville, Tennessee, we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11015)|
| 3:03:40| probably got the best quality of life anywhere around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11020)|
| 3:03:45| I don't think that another well done development for people who look for and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11025)|
| 3:03:55| need housing so they can live in this area is an insurmountable problem and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11035)|
| 3:04:05| believe whatever is developed on this property is going to be back in front of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11045)|
| 3:04:11| this body and others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11051)|
| 3:04:13| It's not going to be any kind of a problem from that standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11053)|
| 3:04:21| If there are questions or issues, I'm sure they'll be made at the appropriate time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11061)|
| 3:04:27| I'd ask that we have a motion to approve the plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11067)|
| 3:04:37| Thank you, Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11077)|
| 3:04:39| Vice Chair Newton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11079)|
| 3:04:41| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11081)|
| 3:04:43| This is ground zero for just significant development as we all know and I think the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11083)|
| 3:04:49| county is aware of the traffic issues as stated by Director Snowden and I know TDOT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11089)|
| 3:04:55| and the county and Farragut are working on intersection improvements at the interstate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11095)|
| 3:05:00| and all the other concerns addressed or that were brought up by the neighboring resident| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11100)|
| 3:05:08| will be handled at the concept plan stage and the development plan stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11108)|
| 3:05:12| I'd like to make a motion that we approve the sector plan amendment to LDR, low density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11112)|
| 3:05:17| hillside protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11117)|
| 3:05:18| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11118)|
| 3:05:19| We've got a motion by Vice Chair Newton to approve the sector plan amendment to LDR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11119)|
| 3:05:25| first staff recommendation and seconded by Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11125)|
| 3:05:32| Let's see, we still have lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11132)|
| 3:05:34| Commissioner Schelso.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11134)|
| 3:05:36| I was going to make a motion to approve it despite the fact that this isn't the concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11136)|
| 3:05:42| plan yet, but when we do see the concept plan, when you look at this entire area and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11142)|
| 3:05:48| lack of any connectivity between any of those subdivisions, if this were to come before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11148)|
| 3:05:53| us as a concept plan that only goes out to that one road, I would be opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11153)|
| 3:05:58| This is too late, so I would have made the motion to approve it because everything is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11158)|
| 3:06:01| already built out around it, but this is a really good example of building subdivisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11161)|
| 3:06:07| and not community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11167)|
| 3:06:08| We're not building, you know, people who have friends in, I mean, people won't be friends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11168)|
| 3:06:12| because they won't know who lives behind them because they'll never walk down the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11172)|

| 3:06:24| All right, we have a motion and a second, so all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11184)|
| 3:06:29| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11189)|
| 3:06:30| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11190)|
| 3:06:31| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11191)|
| 3:06:33| Mr. Chair, I'd like to make a motion that we approve the PR plan residential zone up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11193)|
| 3:06:36| to five Ds per the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11196)|
| 3:06:38| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11198)|
| 3:06:39| We've got a motion by Vice Chair Uten to approve the plan residential per staff recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11199)|
| 3:06:44| up to five dwelling units per acre, seconded by Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11204)|
| 3:06:48| Seeing no other lights, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11208)|
| 3:06:50| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11210)|
| 3:06:51| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11211)|
| 3:06:52| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11212)|
| 3:06:54| Chairman Hill, I want to second Commissioner Schelso's comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11214)|
| 3:06:59| I think it's well placed and I think he's looking long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11219)|
| 3:07:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11223)|
| 3:07:12| All right, agenda item 27, applicant Ralph Smith, location south side of Old Cobbs Ferry Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11232)|
| 3:07:19| east of intersection of West Emory Road, Hackworth Road and Old Cobbs Ferry Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11239)|
| 3:07:27| approximate size .838 acre, resident zoning ag, zoning requested, low density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11247)|
| 3:07:35| existing land use, agricultural, forestry and vacant land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11255)|
| 3:07:39| Staff recommendation on the motion is to deny low density residential zone because it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11259)|
| 3:07:46| not consistent with the sector plan or growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11266)|
| 3:07:50| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11270)|
| 3:07:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11272)|
| 3:07:53| Ralph Smith, 205 Lamar Avenue, Clinton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11273)|
| 3:07:56| Do we have any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11276)|
| 3:07:59| Opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11279)|
| 3:08:00| Seeing no opposition, please proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11280)|
| 3:08:03| When we started this little project, the owner of the property, Mr. Sharp, has 20 plus acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11283)|
| 3:08:10| right there plus other property in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11290)|
| 3:08:12| And it has an existing house you can see in the middle of that road frontage right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11292)|
| 3:08:19| And he moved another house, which he's wont to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11299)|
| 3:08:22| He's done this several times, is move a house onto pieces of his property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11302)|
| 3:08:26| fix them up and provide long-term rental for folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11306)|
| 3:08:31| So he moved the other house in the corner right there, in the northwest corner of this track,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11311)|
| 3:08:36| onto the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11316)|
| 3:08:38| And we didn't have to do any kind of resub or rezoning because we had ag zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11318)|
| 3:08:42| and we had plenty of acreage to have two residences on one track that big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11322)|
| 3:08:47| So it wasn't an issue until he got ready to build his son a house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11327)|
| 3:08:50| And he would like to put his son's house behind that rental on the northwest corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11330)|
| 3:08:56| So it seemed like, just looking at the zoning map, it would be a logical thing to go for RA zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11336)|
| 3:09:03| And apparently that's not logical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11343)|
| 3:09:07| That's bumping up against too many other plans, sector plans and growth plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11347)|
| 3:09:14| We would like to have the RA zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11354)|
| 3:09:16| We don't want an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11356)|
| 3:09:18| We were given the option of, well, why don't you just rezone to PR and have an acre lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11358)|
| 3:09:23| which planning would approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11363)|
| 3:09:26| But there wasn't any point to rezone to PR if we're going to have a one-acre lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11366)|
| 3:09:32| We've got one-acre lots available in ag zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11372)|
| 3:09:36| So we went with RA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11376)|
| 3:09:38| And one of the reasons for doing that is just to kind of avoid another step of development approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11378)|
| 3:09:45| which we would have to do if we rezoned to PR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11385)|
| 3:09:48| Then we've got to come back and ask for a development plan to be approved just to build a house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11388)|
| 3:09:54| That just seems like an awful lot of unnecessary expense and trouble to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11394)|
| 3:10:01| All we want to do is build a house for his son.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11401)|
| 3:10:03| He doesn't want a one-acre lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11403)|
| 3:10:04| so we were going to go for the half-acre lot that you might have seen included in the package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11404)|
| 3:10:10| We wouldn't even have probably asked to rezone the little rental house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11410)|
| 3:10:15| but it just seemed like a natural move if we were going to do a lot behind that rental house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11415)|
| 3:10:20| just to go ahead and rezone them both at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11420)|
| 3:10:23| We could have still left it on ag zoning and had plenty of acreage to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11423)|
| 3:10:28| But we're asking for a common-sense ruling on this, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11428)|
| 3:10:36| If you look at the growth plan, it is planned growth or growth area all around us to the east and to the south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11436)|
| 3:10:48| I get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11448)|
| 3:10:49| I get zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11449)|
| 3:10:50| I get why you do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11450)|
| 3:10:52| I live just a few miles from here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11452)|
| 3:10:54| I don't like the way everything has gone PR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11454)|
| 3:10:57| and we're not going to have a pasture left in Corns soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11457)|
| 3:11:01| I don't like that, but I can accept it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11461)|
| 3:11:04| If I want to live in Corns, I suspect that a lot of other people want to live in Corns, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11464)|
| 3:11:09| But the reasons for doing this, I mean, we don't really have to worry about added traffic on Old Cobbs Ferry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11469)|
| 3:11:16| We're right at the very end of Old Cobbs Ferry, and we're only talking about one other house there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11476)|
| 3:11:22| If we say that we can't rezone to RA right here because it doesn't fit one of the other multitude of plans out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11482)|
| 3:11:31| then does that mean that everybody else north of the highway and west of all this other PR zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11491)|
| 3:11:37| can't do anything with their ag property unless they go to PR?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11497)|
| 3:11:41| It just seems like quite an overreach, and it seems like an awful lot for us to go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11501)|
| 3:11:47| just to be able to build a house on a piece of property that's less than an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11507)|
| 3:11:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11512)|

| 3:13:32| I was confused when I saw a slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11612)|

| 3:13:39| Got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11619)|
| 3:13:40| There was probably a very concerned look on my face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11620)|
| 3:13:43| Got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11623)|
| 3:13:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11624)|

| 3:13:51| Mr. Chairman, before we go on to the next item, and I don't normally do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11631)|
| 3:13:54| but I want to give everybody a chance to stand up for just a second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11634)|
| 3:13:58| but for a very important purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11638)|
| 3:14:00| April is Child Abuse Prevention Month in this country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11640)|
| 3:14:05| and in the time we've been here, unfortunately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11645)|
| 3:14:08| one child in this country has died due to child abuse and neglect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11648)|
| 3:14:12| Today we will lose five kids, as we do every single day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11652)|
| 3:14:15| So I want to just ask for just a moment of silence, actually 25 seconds to be exact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11655)|
| 3:14:21| five seconds for every child that will die today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11661)|
| 3:14:24| Give us a chance to stand up before we move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11664)|
| 3:14:26| But as a body, just for us to recognize the fact that child abuse and neglect is something that's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11666)|
| 3:14:31| It's happening in our community, the organization I work for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11671)|
| 3:14:34| Last year we helped a little over 6,800 kids right here in the greater Knoxville area that suffered abuse and neglect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11674)|
| 3:14:41| Seventy-one percent of those suffered sexual abuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11681)|
| 3:14:43| So if we could just take 25 seconds, stand, take a moment of silence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11683)|

| 3:17:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11852)|
| 3:17:36| Commissioner, how do you want to deal with the time here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11856)|
| 3:17:41| Two minutes each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11861)|
| 3:17:44| Everybody's suitable with two minutes each?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11864)|
| 3:17:46| Okay. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11866)|
| 3:17:48| Hi. I'm Ashley Wheeler, 7201 Ball Camp Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11868)|
| 3:17:53| So I'm in the home that this is surrounding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11873)|
| 3:17:57| Based on this previously being family property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11877)|
| 3:18:01| what I know of the land around it is approximately 1.4 acres is protected wetlands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11881)|
| 3:18:09| And then the remaining 2.6 could be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11889)|
| 3:18:13| I also know that there is only septic systems underneath the ground for sewage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11893)|
| 3:18:20| And in the past, we have dealt with the previous owner leaving abandoned vehicles and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11900)|
| 3:18:29| So there's some concern around that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11909)|
| 3:18:33| I'll try to be quick and not get emotional about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11913)|
| 3:18:37| But realistically, it's just kind of a cumbersome issue to develop around there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11917)|
| 3:18:42| And Ball Camp Pike is right in front of our home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11922)|
| 3:18:45| And there's the Amherst and Ball Camp Pike intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11925)|
| 3:18:48| And I know while Shod Road is going to be going through, there's no definite date for that to be completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11928)|
| 3:18:54| And we are consistently having accidents and congestion and unable to pull out of our driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11934)|
| 3:19:00| And so we just have a lot of issues there that we're concerned about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11940)|
| 3:19:03| if it were to be approved and go through with development before Shod Road is complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11943)|
| 3:19:09| And I guess I'll just stop there and let somebody else talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11949)|
| 3:19:13| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11953)|
| 3:19:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11955)|
| 3:19:18| Ronnie Finley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11958)|
| 3:19:30| I'm Ronnie Finley. I live at 7117 Ball Camp Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11970)|
| 3:19:34| I've lived there for 40 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11974)|
| 3:19:36| My home is 75 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11976)|
| 3:19:42| I understand progress, development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11982)|
| 3:19:47| When I first moved there 40 years ago, it was county from Clinton Highway to Lovell Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11987)|
| 3:19:54| It's changed quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11994)|
| 3:19:57| The only problem I have, I do not want to see multi-unit housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=11997)|
| 3:20:05| If that was single home, single family residence, I would understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12005)|
| 3:20:12| There's not an apartment complex nowhere up and down Ball Camp Pike, Shod Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12012)|
| 3:20:19| It's residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12019)|
| 3:20:21| It's a very old residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12021)|
| 3:20:24| There's a 100-year farm a quarter mile down the street from me, and I'm just dragging it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12024)|
| 3:20:33| There is wetlands there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12033)|
| 3:20:37| So you're going to talk, if you talk multi-family, you're talking about adding 100 cars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12037)|
| 3:20:45| if you make it multi-family on that acreage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12045)|
| 3:20:52| I'm looking at a subdivision across the street from me, Spring Lake Farms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12052)|
| 3:20:57| It used to be the old stab place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12057)|
| 3:20:59| Some of you know him. I own Shoney's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12059)|
| 3:21:03| There's going to be 200 new homes there. It's been approved. They're building them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12063)|
| 3:21:09| There is no traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12069)|
| 3:21:11| I have called the county several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12071)|
| 3:21:15| It's on record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12075)|
| 3:21:18| The flooding off of Beaver Creek, we've had a water issue for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12078)|
| 3:21:26| Can't seem to get anything done about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12086)|
| 3:21:31| Our traffic issue has just continuously grown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12091)|
| 3:21:35| Like my neighbor said, the new Shod Road, it ain't going to be done for another year at least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12095)|
| 3:21:42| They got one more bridge yet to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12102)|
| 3:21:45| Mr. Bentley, if you could wrap up please. We're out of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12105)|
| 3:21:48| Well, there's no sewer for these multi-homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12108)|
| 3:21:55| There is no sewer acceptability right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12115)|
| 3:21:58| I know. I live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12118)|
| 3:22:03| You're adding congestion and traffic without ever having anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12123)|
| 3:22:10| These 200 homes across the street are going to dump onto Amherst.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12130)|
| 3:22:16| 150 feet from the red light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12136)|
| 3:22:19| If you've ever been in that area, which you probably haven't, especially during the traffic times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12139)|
| 3:22:25| it's backed up in each way as far as you can see for about a quarter to a half mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12145)|
| 3:22:33| Even when Mercy Beach was coming down through there, that kind of traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12153)|
| 3:22:40| they struggle getting through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12160)|
| 3:22:46| I think it needs to be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12166)|
| 3:22:48| I'm not against progress, but I think that ought to be a single family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12168)|
| 3:22:53| That's what's all around there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12173)|
| 3:22:55| There are no multi-families up and down through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12175)|
| 3:22:58| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12178)|

| 3:23:26| I represent Sam Downey, who lives at 7201 Ball Camp Potty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12206)|
| 3:23:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12212)|
| 3:23:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12214)|
| 3:23:35| Commission, are we okay with adding another speaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12215)|
| 3:23:39| I'll be really quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12219)|
| 3:23:48| I'm Rebecca Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12228)|
| 3:23:51| Ashley Wheeler's mom, who lives at 7201 Ball Camp Potty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12231)|
| 3:23:56| My dad was born in that house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12236)|
| 3:23:58| My grandfather built the house that they live in, so that's that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12238)|
| 3:24:02| So I'm a little emotional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12242)|
| 3:24:05| and I will tell you that the person that is developing this land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12245)|
| 3:24:13| has taken every right and every privilege that he has wanted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12253)|
| 3:24:18| because he said he owned the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12258)|
| 3:24:22| Water, where that is wetland, it was to never be built on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12262)|
| 3:24:28| and I would urge someone to go out and inspect that land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12268)|
| 3:24:33| that they're wanting to build on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12273)|
| 3:24:39| When you've got somebody where they've gone in and redone this home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12279)|
| 3:24:43| and this has been farm, agricultural area for, I mean, I'm 63.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12283)|
| 3:24:49| My grandfather built that house in 19-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12289)|
| 3:24:53| well, he added on starting in 1934, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12293)|
| 3:24:59| and developed all that land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12299)|
| 3:25:03| And when you see that and you see somebody come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12303)|
| 3:25:07| and where you have nothing but water all around there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12307)|
| 3:25:11| and all that area where the roads are being developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12311)|
| 3:25:16| I would urge you just to go out and look what's going to be built on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12316)|
| 3:25:20| and somebody who is defiant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12320)|
| 3:25:23| It's like building residential places on quicksand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12323)|

| 3:25:42| Good afternoon, Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12342)|
| 3:25:44| I'm Brenda Brooks, and I represent-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12344)|
| 3:25:46| I'm an attorney with Moore & Brooks, 6223 Highland Place Way, 37919,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12346)|
| 3:25:53| and I represent Seth Downing, who lives at 7201 Ball Camp Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12353)|
| 3:25:58| The other speakers have addressed all of the issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12358)|
| 3:26:01| that we would bring to your attention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12361)|
| 3:26:03| but there are four fundamental problems with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12363)|
| 3:26:06| This property, this rezoning is premature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12366)|
| 3:26:11| The traffic is a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12371)|
| 3:26:13| The surrounding properties are zoned agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12373)|
| 3:26:18| There's very little development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12378)|
| 3:26:20| The wetlands is well documented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12380)|
| 3:26:23| There are springs on this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12383)|
| 3:26:25| and in conjunction with the traffic, there are insufficient utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12385)|
| 3:26:30| The applicant says that there is KUB sewer and utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12390)|
| 3:26:37| These properties are on the septic system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12397)|
| 3:26:40| The utilities end north of the school, and I don't know my directions exactly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12400)|
| 3:26:48| but there is no-the only thing these properties have is septic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12408)|
| 3:26:55| So that is a major problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12415)|
| 3:26:57| The development would be premature, and really talking about the wetlands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12417)|
| 3:27:01| you can see on this map, the blue line, there is actually another line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12421)|
| 3:27:07| It's an upside-down diagonal T.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12427)|
| 3:27:11| Most of the 4.05 is not-cannot be used,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12431)|
| 3:27:17| so you're getting to the point where it can't be up to 10 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12437)|
| 3:27:24| It just is not compatible with the use that the developer seeks to use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12444)|
| 3:27:32| seeks to have it rezoned for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12452)|
| 3:27:36| The Shod Road is a dead end right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12456)|
| 3:27:42| If you go to the left on the screen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12462)|
| 3:27:46| there is no Shod Road less than a mile south of this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12466)|
| 3:27:51| All the traffic has to use these little connector streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12471)|
| 3:27:56| There was something on WBIR a couple years ago about Johnson Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12476)|
| 3:28:01| which is a little connector street with ball camp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12481)|
| 3:28:04| That is just-traffic complaints are horrendous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12484)|
| 3:28:07| Amherst and ball camp, traffic complaints are horrendous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12487)|
| 3:28:11| This property, the infrastructure is just not ready for this rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12491)|
| 3:28:18| and I would also like, if there is a postponement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12498)|
| 3:28:23| to get more information for your consideration about the wetlands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12503)|
| 3:28:27| There are springs underneath that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12507)|
| 3:28:30| The lady that would be in charge of the Tennessee Department of Conservation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12510)|
| 3:28:35| she's out until April the 17th, so I did not have the chance to talk to her,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12515)|
| 3:28:39| but I think that is a very important consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12519)|
| 3:28:42| if you're looking at medium density for this particular property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12522)|
| 3:28:46| It's not appropriate. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12526)|
| 3:28:48| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12528)|
| 3:28:56| Do I say my name and address again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12536)|
| 3:28:58| No, you don't have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12538)|
| 3:28:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12539)|
| 3:29:00| Just to kind of address some of the concerns from the citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12540)|
| 3:29:06| I do want to clarify that this is just for rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12546)|
| 3:29:12| That's why there is not more information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12552)|
| 3:29:16| We'll have to come back for concept, things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12556)|
| 3:29:20| and at that time there's obviously way more information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12560)|
| 3:29:24| and then when we go to the design plan phase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12564)|
| 3:29:26| even more information that the county will deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12566)|
| 3:29:30| We are aware that there is a – we got a hydraulic determination from GEOS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12570)|
| 3:29:37| There is a stream that basically runs along the backside of this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12577)|
| 3:29:44| because this is preliminary and it's just for rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12584)|
| 3:29:49| We usually wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12589)|
| 3:29:50| We are required by the state if we disturb more than an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12590)|
| 3:29:54| to get the stream determination and wetland delineation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12594)|
| 3:29:58| so at that time we are required by the state to have those documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12598)|
| 3:30:04| Because we have already established that there is a blue line stream on the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12604)|
| 3:30:10| we've already taken that into consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12610)|
| 3:30:12| as far as the buffers that are required for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12612)|
| 3:30:17| We have a general concept depending on how this progresses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12617)|
| 3:30:23| The entire pretty much where that is located is unbuildable as they state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12623)|
| 3:30:30| Part of the reason for the requested zoning is to be able to use what remains of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12630)|
| 3:30:37| as buildable area to have the density needed to create a subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12637)|
| 3:30:48| Just like what we're proposing right now, whenever we do come back for a concept,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12648)|
| 3:30:55| they're looking into townhomes in this area, the density of up to 10 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12655)|
| 3:31:04| So if, let's say, there is only three acres that can be used, that's 30 townhomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12664)|
| 3:31:12| It won't be the amount of acreage that we have will limit the 10 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12672)|
| 3:31:21| If there's only three acres available, then that's only 30 townhomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12681)|
| 3:31:29| Additionally, I know that they're worried about seeing a development from their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12689)|
| 3:31:35| One of the conditions based on staff is that we have to have a landscape, I think it's a B buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12695)|
| 3:31:43| That's a 20-foot landscape buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12703)|
| 3:31:47| It's for any areas around our property that are agriculture, which is all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12707)|
| 3:31:53| So there will be a 20-foot landscape buffer requirement around the entirety of this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12713)|
| 3:32:00| And we are in staff agreement with that condition as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12720)|
| 3:32:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12728)|
| 3:32:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12729)|
| 3:32:11| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12731)|
| 3:32:14| I have a question about how, first of all, where this is positioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12734)|
| 3:32:23| Right on Shod Road, it does seem to offer the transitional sort of development that we look for on larger roads like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12743)|
| 3:32:35| to provide some transition to single family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12755)|
| 3:32:39| But my question is about the septic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12759)|
| 3:32:42| Sorry, I don't know this, but how do you put a development there with only septic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12762)|
| 3:32:50| We can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12770)|
| 3:32:52| We can go to County Engineering if you want to speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12772)|
| 3:32:57| You can't put that many units on 3A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12777)|
| 3:33:01| I was asking a question about the existence or nonexistence of the septic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12781)|
| 3:33:06| and how a development could go in without that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12786)|
| 3:33:09| And my colleagues were confirming it can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12789)|
| 3:33:11| We have to have a sewer connection there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12791)|
| 3:33:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12793)|
| 3:33:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12794)|
| 3:33:15| Sorry, I was muted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12795)|
| 3:33:21| Commissioner Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12801)|
| 3:33:26| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12806)|
| 3:33:27| I think this is a pretty good location for some density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12807)|
| 3:33:30| You know, we get a lot of heat a lot of times that we don't plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12810)|
| 3:33:35| You know, you've got to plan the roads before you plan the densities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12815)|
| 3:33:39| and the developments and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12819)|
| 3:33:41| And this certainly has been planned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12821)|
| 3:33:44| And I would throw this out to County Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12824)|
| 3:33:47| Can you give us an update on the road, the extension?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12827)|
| 3:33:50| I know it's been in the works for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12830)|
| 3:33:53| Do you have any idea when it will be done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12833)|
| 3:33:55| Yes, sir, Commissioner Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12835)|
| 3:33:57| The contractor has until December of this year to complete the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12837)|
| 3:34:01| However, the bridge, we do have one bridge that is remaining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12841)|
| 3:34:06| We're having some issues with CSX coordination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12846)|
| 3:34:09| So we do anticipate an extension most likely probably spring, summer of 2024, unfortunately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12849)|
| 3:34:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12856)|
| 3:34:17| But it's in the works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12857)|
| 3:34:18| It's certainly been a huge road project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12858)|
| 3:34:21| And, again, I mean, with that kind of dollars that were expended from the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12861)|
| 3:34:25| and the county, everybody involved, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12865)|
| 3:34:29| that's how it ended up in the sector plan is medium-density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12869)|
| 3:34:32| as the staff pointed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12872)|
| 3:34:34| So I would be in support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12874)|
| 3:34:38| Commissioner Schill, so this is, I guess, a staff question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12878)|
| 3:34:42| We don't have a minimum acreage area for PR, do we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12882)|
| 3:34:48| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12888)|
| 3:34:49| Besides, like, the setbacks that are part of PR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12889)|
| 3:34:52| No, we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12892)|
| 3:34:53| I mean, there are certain lot sizes that lend themselves better to PR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12893)|
| 3:34:55| because of the peripheral boundary, but there's not a minimum per se.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12895)|
| 3:34:58| So, I guess, in looking at this and what Sean wrote, the extension of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12898)|
| 3:35:04| and the likelihood of a very changing area, I mean, it kind of worries me that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12904)|
| 3:35:09| we could just see a lot of little tiny PR zone requests along these spots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12909)|
| 3:35:16| And, you know, how does, I mean, we're going to have another, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12916)|
| 3:35:19| Kingston Pike with lots of little, you know, driveways coming in and off of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12919)|
| 3:35:24| Maybe for Mr. Stone, what are the driveway requirements for getting on to Sean Road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12924)|
| 3:35:32| Yeah, in this case, I mean, this is an arterial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12932)|
| 3:35:34| so it would meet the most restringent requirements we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12934)|
| 3:35:39| We'd probably most likely want them to get an access point at the median cut there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12939)|
| 3:35:44| But it would be pretty stringent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12944)|
| 3:35:46| I mean, this being an arterial, it would be something we'd barely look close at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12946)|
| 3:35:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12951)|
| 3:35:52| You know, I think the density is pretty appropriate here for the size of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12952)|
| 3:35:54| It's not great to build a four-lane road and, you know, only build single-family residences along it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12954)|
| 3:35:59| But just kind of thinking about how we don't have a minimum on PR kind of worries me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12959)|
| 3:36:03| with lots of little tiny pocket neighborhoods popping up along it without much safety concern, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12963)|
| 3:36:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12970)|
| 3:36:11| Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12971)|
| 3:36:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12972)|
| 3:36:13| I heard some comments that I think are ironic in contrast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12973)|
| 3:36:20| There were some comments about subdivision adding 200 units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12980)|
| 3:36:25| and then there's comments about the destruction, the loss of natural resources and farmland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12985)|
| 3:36:31| And I think that in a scenario like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12991)|
| 3:36:36| this is kind of a perfect location to maybe switch out units that could be, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=12996)|
| 3:36:45| sprawled out over existing farmland and put, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13005)|
| 3:36:49| in this location that is on these major roads and really in a developed area that is continuing to develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13009)|
| 3:36:58| So with that, I'd like to make a motion to support following staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13018)|
| 3:37:09| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13029)|
| 3:37:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13031)|
| 3:37:12| So we've got a motion by Commissioner Higgins to approve PR up to 12 dwelling units per acre per staff record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13032)|
| 3:37:20| What did I say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13040)|
| 3:37:21| Ten dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13041)|
| 3:37:24| Seconded by Commissioner Adams, and we have more lights here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13044)|
| 3:37:28| So let's go to Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13048)|
| 3:37:30| And this is a question for staff, and I just can't find the button.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13050)|
| 3:37:34| But the staff report says the utilities, that there is a sewer source through West Knox Utility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13054)|
| 3:37:39| I'm hearing there isn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13059)|
| 3:37:40| I can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13060)|
| 3:37:41| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13061)|
| 3:37:42| I was sitting here trying to find it in the map and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13062)|
| 3:37:47| Is there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13067)|
| 3:37:48| Where's the nearest sewer connection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13068)|
| 3:37:50| Back in Dadey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13070)|
| 3:37:51| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13071)|
| 3:37:52| Sorry, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13072)|
| 3:37:53| I've got to ask staff that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13073)|
| 3:37:57| So we don't actually have the utility companies consider their lines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13077)|
| 3:38:01| their specific line locations to be proprietary so we can tell where the districts are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13081)|
| 3:38:05| So part of the properties within KUB's district and part of the properties, I believe it was Northwest Utility District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13085)|
| 3:38:12| but I'm sure the applicant could probably speak to whether there's plans to connect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13092)|
| 3:38:16| and where those connections would be located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13096)|
| 3:38:22| Kind of what was mentioned before is that we cannot build this development without connection to public water and sewer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13102)|
| 3:38:30| so that will be part of our future plans with the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13110)|
| 3:38:35| It has to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13115)|
| 3:38:36| It's a requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13116)|
| 3:38:42| Can I say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13122)|
| 3:38:43| Well, I'm just going to talk on that subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13123)|
| 3:38:49| My name is Alex Botisat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13129)|
| 3:38:51| I'm Sergey's son.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13131)|
| 3:38:53| But what I wanted to say, so before, he bought this property a few years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13133)|
| 3:38:57| We wanted to use it to build a shop there for my construction company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13137)|
| 3:39:02| I came to the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13142)|
| 3:39:04| They said that would probably not work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13144)|
| 3:39:06| So they said the best thing is to put some kind of multifamily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13146)|
| 3:39:11| So what I've decided is to do townhouses there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13151)|
| 3:39:14| But I got with David that works with Katie beforehand, and we made sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13154)|
| 3:39:21| I don't know exactly where the location of the sewer is, but there is sewer there, and all the utilities are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13161)|
| 3:39:26| I know where Sergey and he talked about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13166)|
| 3:39:29| It's not nowhere near that property, no accessibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13169)|
| 3:39:32| Look, I don't know why we're discussing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13172)|
| 3:39:34| They can't move forward without it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13174)|
| 3:39:36| Let's just, if, so let's just, is it appropriate rezoning and just know that they've got to have sewer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13176)|
| 3:39:45| I think that's where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13185)|
| 3:39:46| We're just spending needless time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13186)|
| 3:39:51| Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13191)|
| 3:39:52| Thank you, Chairman Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13192)|
| 3:39:53| Question for Ms. Porche.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13193)|
| 3:39:56| When calculating the area, and part of this is going to have some riparian issues, not sinkholes, but spring, maybe a creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13196)|
| 3:40:09| Is that included in the square feet of the site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13209)|
| 3:40:16| The PR zone, as it is now, is requesting the 10 dwelling units per acre multiplied by the 4.01 acres on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13216)|
| 3:40:24| They would be able to get up to 40 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13224)|
| 3:40:26| Now, the buffer zone that would be required around the blue line stream and any other conditions around the riparian areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13226)|
| 3:40:34| that might shrink that site so that those 40 units are clustered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13234)|
| 3:40:39| They're going to be clustered on probably less than three acres, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13239)|
| 3:40:44| I don't know the acreage of what the buffer is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13244)|
| 3:40:46| It's not showing up as a wetline stream in our maps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13246)|
| 3:40:49| Just guessing that with what the engineer said, probably an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13249)|
| 3:40:54| So you're putting 40 units on less than three acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13254)|
| 3:40:59| Well, that's pretty dense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13259)|
| 3:41:03| And there's nothing around it even close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13263)|
| 3:41:06| And I can understand the rationale to maximize density because you have a school and it's on an upgraded road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13266)|
| 3:41:15| But that's an awful dense piece of property for 40 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13275)|
| 3:41:21| We're not dealing with just 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13281)|
| 3:41:23| We're dealing with 40 units on less than three acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13283)|
| 3:41:28| All right, we've got a motion and a second to approve plan residential up to 10 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13288)|
| 3:41:36| Seeing no other lights, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13296)|
| 3:41:39| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13299)|
| 3:41:40| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13300)|
| 3:41:41| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13301)|
| 3:41:43| Okay, we've got, let me see the nos, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13303)|
| 3:41:46| We've got one, two, three, four, is that any others?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13306)|
| 3:41:52| Four nos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13312)|
| 3:41:57| I'm sorry, I have Phillip Smith minus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13317)|
| 3:42:03| Vice chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13323)|

| 3:42:15| Getting late, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13335)|
| 3:42:16| All right, motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13336)|
| 3:42:18| Moving on, agenda item 33.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13338)|
| 3:42:22| Is that where we are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13342)|
| 3:42:25| Double check me, it's getting late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13345)|
| 3:42:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13347)|
| 3:42:29| 33 applicant Gary Burke, location west of Freeway Heights Drive and south of Gordon Smith Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13349)|
| 3:42:36| 1.86 acres, present zoning ag, zoning requested, planned residential, existing land use, agriculture, forestry, vacant land, single family residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13356)|
| 3:42:45| Density proposed up to five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13365)|
| 3:42:48| Staff recommendation on motion is to approve planned residential zone with up to two dwelling units per acre because it is consistent with the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13368)|
| 3:42:58| and brings the subject properties into compliance with the Knox County zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13378)|
| 3:43:06| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13386)|

| 3:44:51| He is asking to build nine dwelling units on 1.86 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13491)|
| 3:44:58| Staff recommendations are approved to up to two dwelling units per acre on this 1.86 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13498)|
| 3:45:06| which would be at least a one single family dwelling unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13506)|
| 3:45:11| They also are suggesting that the applicant could build three dwelling units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13511)|
| 3:45:15| the same as the current lot configurations allow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13515)|
| 3:45:20| Freeway Heights Drive is a 12-foot wide road, which does not meet public road standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13520)|
| 3:45:27| The Knox County Engineering and Public Works Department has stated that additional residents beyond what is currently allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13527)|
| 3:45:35| would trigger road improvements along the length of the Freeway Heights Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13535)|
| 3:45:42| This road is not one the county has plans to improve or widen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13542)|
| 3:45:47| Rezoning to allow more residents above what is currently allowed would put more pressure on this road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13547)|
| 3:45:54| What is currently allowed is the total of three dwellings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13554)|
| 3:45:59| I am speaking on behalf of our family and community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13559)|
| 3:46:04| Adding just one single family dwelling unit could add up to three extra cars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13564)|
| 3:46:09| and adding three units could add up to nine extra cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13569)|
| 3:46:13| Six to nine extra cars, which is two to three dwelling units and 40 extra trips per day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13573)|
| 3:46:20| could put more pressure on this narrow road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13580)|
| 3:46:24| We are requesting one single family dwelling instead of two or three dwellings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13584)|
| 3:46:29| Here are our concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13589)|
| 3:46:31| Freeway Heights Drive is a one-lane narrow road not wide enough to accommodate any more traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13591)|
| 3:46:39| People in this neighborhood walk this road daily with children and pets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13599)|
| 3:46:44| The road already is experiencing traffic from Tyndall Building Supply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13604)|
| 3:46:49| and drive-through traffic from Gordon Smith Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13609)|
| 3:46:53| Allowing two or three more residents will add more traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13613)|
| 3:46:57| causing it to be dangerous with accidents on the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13617)|
| 3:47:01| Although there is a 15-mile-per-hour speed limit sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13621)|
| 3:47:05| most vehicles don't pay attention to the sign and drive fast on this road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13625)|
| 3:47:10| and it's dangerous for my daughters, myself, and all the children that we have that walk on this road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13630)|
| 3:47:16| We have advised our seven grandchildren to hold an adult's hand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13636)|
| 3:47:20| as they are getting into their car to leave because of this extra traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13640)|
| 3:47:25| When driving on Freeway Heights Drive, you have to pull over onto the neighbor's yard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13645)|
| 3:47:30| causing property damage and possible vehicle damage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13650)|
| 3:47:35| Pulling onto Freeway Heights Drive from Norris Freeway, if you can see it on the map, is also dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13655)|
| 3:47:42| You must wait as traffic backs up on the highway to allow the other vehicle to pull out onto the highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13662)|
| 3:47:49| because the road is a one-lane road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13669)|
| 3:47:52| Let's also consider Mays Chapel Road, which connects to Gordon Smith Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13672)|
| 3:47:57| and it connects to Freeway Heights Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13677)|
| 3:47:59| That's the road we live on, and that is the property that we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13679)|
| 3:48:03| Mays Chapel is a dangerous road, which is as tight as two cars pass each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13683)|
| 3:48:10| It is used as a back road for people who want to avoid Emery Road and Norris Freeway traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13690)|
| 3:48:16| Gordon Smith Road is a dangerous road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13696)|
| 3:48:19| As you drive down this road, it is tight and curvy as other cars pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13699)|
| 3:48:24| Pulling on Norris Freeway is also a concern for Hannes Grove's residents that is adjacent to Freeway Heights Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13704)|
| 3:48:33| It takes multiple times for the red light to change before it's your turn to cross.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13713)|
| 3:48:38| There has been many accidents because of the extra traffic at this intersection of Norris Freeway and Emery Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13718)|
| 3:48:46| On April 5th, I wasn't planning on going out that day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13726)|
| 3:48:51| but I ended up seeing an accident where the car had flipped upside down at the intersection of Norris Freeway and Emery Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13731)|
| 3:48:59| Our neighborhood is a quiet neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13739)|
| 3:49:01| and adding more than a single family dwelling would be too much more traffic for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13741)|
| 3:49:07| Thank you all for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13747)|
| 3:49:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13748)|
| 3:49:13| Applicant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13753)|
| 3:49:24| Firstly, I would like to thank you for allowing me this time out of your day to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13764)|
| 3:49:32| I would also like to mention that this, too, is my first time speaking at a Planning Commission meeting and this process as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13772)|
| 3:49:39| And while I appreciate the opportunity to do so, I must ask the Commission, as well as the opposition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13779)|
| 3:49:44| to please forgive me in advance if I am unfamiliar with any questions or knowledge that you might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13784)|
| 3:49:48| If that is the case, I am more than happy to acquire those answers from someone who does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13788)|
| 3:49:53| I would also like to finish my allotted time with the assurance that JLB Contractor is not one of the big players here in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13793)|
| 3:50:00| buying up and building with no care to the community's values, much less the values and ways of life belonging to its beloved residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13800)|
| 3:50:07| I sat and read all of the comments, all 70 of them, on the website before I wrote this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13807)|
| 3:50:13| and I wanted to just clarify a few things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13813)|
| 3:50:18| Yes, originally the plan was to put nine units there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13818)|
| 3:50:23| However, with the two dwelling units per acre, or three dwelling units per acre, rather,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13823)|
| 3:50:29| I wanted to just clarify that these are just one-bedroom cottages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13829)|
| 3:50:33| They're not going to be three- and four-bedroom homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13833)|
| 3:50:35| They're not going to be a community there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13835)|
| 3:50:37| It's one-bedroom cottages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13837)|
| 3:50:39| So even if there was allowed to have up to the five dwelling units per acre, that's what we were working on doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13839)|
| 3:50:47| We would be happy to just keep the two dwelling units per acre proposal because I understand that the road is quite narrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13847)|
| 3:50:56| and according to Mr. Snowden, the engineer, it would need to be widened to 16 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13856)|
| 3:51:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13863)|
| 3:51:05| That being said, I thank you all for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13865)|
| 3:51:07| I hope that an approval can be met that is beneficial to all parties involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13867)|
| 3:51:12| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13872)|
| 3:51:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13873)|
| 3:51:15| Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13875)|
| 3:51:22| Last year, I'd like to make a motion that we approve the plain residential zone per staff recommendation for the density, two per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13882)|
| 3:51:30| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13890)|
| 3:51:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13892)|
| 3:51:33| So we have a motion to approve plain residential with up to 12 dwelling units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13893)|
| 3:51:38| Oh, my gosh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13898)|
| 3:51:43| Two dwelling units per acre per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13903)|
| 3:51:47| And that was by Vice Chair Uten, seconded by Commission Perez.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13907)|
| 3:51:53| Seeing no lights, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13913)|
| 3:51:55| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13915)|
| 3:51:56| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13916)|
| 3:51:57| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13917)|
| 3:51:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13919)|
| 3:52:03| Moving on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13923)|
| 3:52:05| Agenda item 34 requires two motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13925)|
| 3:52:11| What's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13931)|
| 3:52:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13932)|
| 3:52:13| Mr. Higgins will be recusing himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13933)|
| 3:52:17| Applicant, Henson Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13937)|
| 3:52:20| Location, northwest side of Westland Drive, west of Watercrest Drive, east of Mont Acres Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13940)|
| 3:52:27| 3.86 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13947)|
| 3:52:29| Present plan designation and zoning is low density residential, planned residential, and proposed plan designation and zoning, medium density residential, and planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13949)|
| 3:52:39| Existing land use, agricultural, forestry, vacant land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13959)|
| 3:52:43| Density proposed up to 12 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13963)|
| 3:52:48| First motion, staff recommendation, approve the sector plan amendment to the MDR land use classification because it is consistent with the property's existing permitted density of 8 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13968)|
| 3:53:03| Second motion, staff recommendation, deny the request to increase the planned residential zone density from 8 dwelling units per acre to 12 dwelling units per acre because it is incompatible with surrounding development and infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13983)|
| 3:53:17| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13997)|
| 3:53:19| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=13999)|
| 3:53:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14000)|
| 3:53:21| Do we have opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14001)|
| 3:53:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14003)|
| 3:53:24| Would you like to proceed or defer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14004)|
| 3:53:25| I'll defer, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14005)|
| 3:53:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14006)|
| 3:53:27| So if the opposition, let's see who we have signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14007)|
| 3:53:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14021)|
| 3:53:42| Mr. Robinson, Robert Robinson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14022)|
| 3:53:45| Yes, I am Robert Robinson and I have the privilege of being the president of the Highland Point Homeowners Association and we're pretty much right across from the proposed development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14025)|
| 3:53:56| We have about 80, well, we have 80 units in our development with about 125 residents or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14036)|
| 3:54:04| And I appreciate the opportunity to speak here and I appreciate how difficult it is to make decisions against competing viewpoints, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14044)|
| 3:54:12| But our board of directors and the majority of our residents that I have talked with are opposed to the increase of density from 8 dwelling units per acre up to 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14052)|
| 3:54:27| And we are in agreement, though, with the staff recommendation of keeping it at 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14067)|
| 3:54:32| And the reasons are fairly straightforward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14072)|
| 3:54:36| If you look at the surrounding area right now, looking at the zoning, the 8 dwelling units per acre for this site in question is actually the highest density for about a half mile radius.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14076)|
| 3:54:51| Our Highland Point HOA is probably the second highest with 7 units per acre, but we actually are less than 6, according to my colleague, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14091)|
| 3:55:01| So we think that going up to, and the surrounding area is actually even lower than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14101)|
| 3:55:08| So we think going to 12 would be inconsistent and not in character with the surrounding area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14108)|
| 3:55:15| And probably the greatest reason is that we fear that this could be the thin end of the wedge, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14115)|
| 3:55:22| That if this were increased to 12, that this could set a precedent for encouraging other areas or allowing other areas to petition to go to 12 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14122)|
| 3:55:36| And we've actually, I think in the past, according to what I've found out, is that there have been other attempts in the immediate area around us to increase density to that kind of level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14136)|
| 3:55:46| So, again, we're opposed to the increase from 8 to 12, and we are in agreement with the staff recommendation to keep it at 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14146)|
| 3:55:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14153)|

| 3:56:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14167)|
| 3:56:08| Commission, are you guys, are you folks okay with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14168)|
| 3:56:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14170)|
| 3:56:11| Proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14171)|
| 3:56:12| I live in Highland Point at 7907 High Heath, and I have lived there for nearly 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14172)|
| 3:56:19| Although we appreciate the planning staff's recommendation to limit density from 12 units per acre to 8, I'm not sure even that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14179)|
| 3:56:32| Because Westland, which is the only road through that area that this new proposed development will be going on, the traffic is terrible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14192)|
| 3:56:45| The road is not in good condition, except for being recently repaved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14205)|
| 3:56:52| There are no shoulders on either side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14212)|
| 3:56:57| It's a narrow road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14217)|
| 3:56:59| It's very curvy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14219)|
| 3:57:00| There are ditches on both sides most of the way between Morrell and Ebenezer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14220)|
| 3:57:07| I'm concerned about the lack of appropriate ingress and ingress from this new development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14227)|
| 3:57:15| The county approved a number of years ago a large apartment and commercial development on the corner of Ebenezer and Westland that has increased significantly the amount of traffic on Westland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14235)|
| 3:57:31| Those of us who live in Highland Point know that most of the time we can't turn left to get on to Westland to get out of our subdivision because there's so much traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14251)|
| 3:57:44| and there's not a good sight line to see the traffic that's coming very fast from the west to the east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14264)|
| 3:57:52| So I ask that you certainly not approve any development that is over the eight units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14272)|
| 3:58:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14281)|
| 3:58:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14282)|
| 3:58:07| Richard Lilly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14287)|
| 3:58:08| Is Richard Lilly here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14288)|
| 3:58:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14291)|
| 3:58:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14292)|
| 3:58:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14293)|
| 3:58:37| Thank you, Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14317)|
| 3:58:38| Ben Mullins, 550 West Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14318)|
| 3:58:41| I hope I can speak in complete sentences at this point in the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14321)|
| 3:58:44| I also want to apologize for my lack of decorum earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14324)|
| 3:58:47| I did not mean to be disruptive in the back, so please forgive me for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14327)|
| 3:58:55| Staffs recommended the sector plan to MDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14335)|
| 3:58:57| This was rezoned to eight dwelling units an acre in 2004, and the sector plan needed to be brought up to consistency with that rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14337)|
| 3:59:08| The request before you today is increasing the zoning from the current eight dwelling units an acre that's already on the property to 12 dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14348)|
| 3:59:15| And just to put that into context, for this 3.86-acre parcel, we're talking about a difference of 16 potential units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14355)|
| 3:59:26| And, you know, when you go up and down Westland, this is probably the only track that really is not already developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14366)|
| 3:59:35| So it's not exactly an infill development, but it's very close or similar to that style.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14375)|
| 3:59:41| You have a piece of property that has been rezoned for eight dwelling units an acre for almost 20 years now, but there's been no real effort to develop it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14381)|
| 3:59:54| There was a development plan that was approved in 2017 that never moved forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14394)|
| 4:00:01| And, you know, I can't remember who said during the agenda review, but if you're hunting for density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14401)|
| 4:00:08| then why not look at an area like this that has existing infrastructure in place instead of pushing it out further, those additional 16 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14408)|
| 4:00:17| We know the people are coming. We know the units are needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14417)|
| 4:00:20| We know they're going to have to go somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14420)|
| 4:00:23| As the staff points out in the report, you know, since the sector plan was adopted, I don't know exactly when that was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14423)|
| 4:00:33| Knoxville's population has increased by approximately 7%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14433)|
| 4:00:38| And I found some statistics that just relate to the city, which the city's line is just to the north across the railroad track here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14438)|
| 4:00:46| that since 2015, the city alone has had over 8,500 residents with projections that it will continue to grow as many as 1,800 residents per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14446)|
| 4:00:58| And, you know, by allowing this type of density in this area, you're really kind of increasing the housing stock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14458)|
| 4:01:04| increasing the diversity of housing stock because, you know, what would work best would be some small-scale townhomes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14464)|
| 4:01:11| which there is a concept plan already prepared for this with the expectation of being able to get 12 units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14471)|
| 4:01:19| And you compare that concept plan to what was proposed in 2017, even though there are more units, there's less impervious area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14479)|
| 4:01:27| there's more increased green space that can be preserved with the design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14487)|
| 4:01:32| and it preserves much more of the privacy along the residents that are there around the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14492)|
| 4:01:39| which is interesting because I think at least two of the residents that live contiguous to the property wrote on the comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14499)|
| 4:01:46| they actually support this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14506)|
| 4:01:48| I know there are several comments in opposition, a lot from Highland Point across the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14508)|
| 4:01:54| but there were comments in favor of this, including the closest affected neighbor there to the north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14514)|
| 4:02:02| And we all know there's a need for housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14522)|
| 4:02:04| So we look at, well, can this property, can it maintain the additional 16 units that are proposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14524)|
| 4:02:13| And the developer's architect reached out to Mr. Snowden and asked him that question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14533)|
| 4:02:21| and especially with regard to the traffic on Highland, and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14541)|
| 4:02:26| if there was anything that could be done to increase the level of service along with the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14546)|
| 4:02:32| And I did send a copy of that email in my letter to you guys last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14552)|
| 4:02:38| And the bottom line is what Mr. Snowden says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14558)|
| 4:02:41| I wouldn't expect a noticeable decline in the level of service with the addition of the trips generated from your development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14561)|
| 4:02:47| regardless of the densities proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14567)|
| 4:02:50| So whether it's at 8 units an acre or 12 units an acre, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14570)|
| 4:02:54| there's not going to be any further decline in the level of services than is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14574)|
| 4:02:59| This is a minor arterial street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14579)|
| 4:03:00| It only has 20 feet of pavement, but it's within a 52 feet to 63 feet right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14580)|
| 4:03:07| And so there's an opportunity for it to be widened along the frontage of this road at this location as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14587)|
| 4:03:14| So, again, instead of pushing this out, increasing sprawl into the rural areas, this is exactly the kind of scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14594)|
| 4:03:21| In fact, I looked at the proposed map for Advanced Knox,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14601)|
| 4:03:24| and that map in Advanced Knox indicated this particular piece of property to be part of their suburban mixed residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14604)|
| 4:03:32| which is defined as similar to suburban residential but with a greater mix of housing types,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14612)|
| 4:03:37| including attached housing and small-scale multifamily housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14617)|
| 4:03:40| So the processes we're trying to look at are earmarking places like this for increased density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14620)|
| 4:03:49| Respectfully, I'd ask that you find that 12 units an acre would be appropriate at this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14629)|
| 4:03:54| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14634)|
| 4:03:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14635)|
| 4:03:57| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14637)|
| 4:03:59| I have a question about a comment that came through that said that this property was going to be used for duplexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14639)|
| 4:04:06| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14646)|
| 4:04:10| The comment said duplexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14650)|
| 4:04:12| I heard Mr. Mullen say townhomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14652)|
| 4:04:16| If you have my letter in front of you that I did send out, it was part of the comments as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14656)|
| 4:04:22| The proposed concept, and it's just a concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14662)|
| 4:04:24| It can change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14664)|
| 4:04:25| But, I mean, you go through the process to go ahead and try to design something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14665)|
| 4:04:31| You're pretty much going to stick with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14671)|
| 4:04:33| These are townhomes, you know, that are kind of around a central courtyard area is what's been proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14673)|
| 4:04:37| So we're looking at 1,500 to 1,800 square feet of townhomes there at that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14677)|
| 4:04:44| I'd like to make a motion to approve the sector plan amendment to the MDR planned use classification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14684)|
| 4:04:49| because it's consistent with the property's existing permitted density of eight dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14689)|
| 4:04:54| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14694)|
| 4:04:56| We've got a motion by Commissioner Adams to approve the sector plan amendment to MDR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14696)|
| 4:05:01| with up to eight dwelling units per acre per staff recommendation, seconded by Commissioner Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14701)|
| 4:05:09| Commissioner Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14709)|
| 4:05:13| If it's just the sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14713)|
| 4:05:16| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14716)|
| 4:05:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14717)|
| 4:05:18| Yeah, I have a comment about the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14718)|
| 4:05:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14720)|
| 4:05:21| The sector plan, the way the motion read, sorry, is that because it is consistent with the property's existing permitted density of eight dwelling units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14721)|
| 4:05:29| that's just for the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14729)|
| 4:05:31| Okay, we're not setting the density of the sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14731)|
| 4:05:32| Right, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14732)|
| 4:05:33| That's why I wanted to make sure I understood it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14733)|
| 4:05:36| Did I abbreviate something that caused confusion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14736)|
| 4:05:38| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14738)|
| 4:05:43| Vice Chair Uten, did you have something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14743)|
| 4:05:45| I was going to do the motion, so I'm good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14745)|
| 4:05:48| Okay, so we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14748)|
| 4:05:53| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14753)|
| 4:05:54| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14754)|
| 4:05:55| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14755)|
| 4:05:56| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14756)|
| 4:06:01| Chair, I did mention on Thursday that I was a little concerned in the rationale about the density between this particular piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14761)|
| 4:06:09| and the one that we voted on previously on the half-built Shod Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14769)|
| 4:06:15| I did not oppose the PR on the Shod Road piece with my fellow commissioner here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14775)|
| 4:06:21| It was just the density on that one because there was, as that one gentleman said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14781)|
| 4:06:26| there were no attached product out there at all, and that's a pretty high-dense number for that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14786)|
| 4:06:34| Here, your book ended in the main roads by some apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14794)|
| 4:06:40| There were some apartments on Westland itself, not even on Ebenezer on the corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14800)|
| 4:06:45| The piece across the street, Mr. Salamone built that a long, long time ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14805)|
| 4:06:50| and I thought that was one of the coolest developments that had been done close in west,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14810)|
| 4:06:54| and that was very dense for West Knoxville at the time, and I think he did a great job with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14814)|
| 4:07:01| Still one of the best developments I think I've seen around here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14821)|
| 4:07:05| and I just think this is a great place for good, smart density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14825)|
| 4:07:08| It backs up the railroad tracks, so I'd like to make a motion that we approve the request for the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14828)|
| 4:07:14| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14834)|
| 4:07:17| How many per acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14837)|
| 4:07:18| Twelve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14838)|
| 4:07:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14840)|
| 4:07:21| Okay, so we have a motion by Vice Chair Uten to approve planned residential up to 12 dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14841)|
| 4:07:30| and we have a second by Commissioner Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14850)|
| 4:07:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14855)|
| 4:07:36| Seeing no other lights other than Commissioner Huber's, we're going to go to a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14856)|
| 4:07:41| Is that okay, Commissioner Huber?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14861)|
| 4:07:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14863)|
| 4:07:44| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14864)|
| 4:07:45| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14865)|
| 4:07:46| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14866)|
| 4:07:47| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14867)|
| 4:07:48| Did I hear a no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14868)|
| 4:07:49| Oh, Commissioner Midas had a no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14869)|

| 4:07:56| Three noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14876)|
| 4:07:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14879)|
| 4:08:04| Twelve dwelling units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14884)|
| 4:08:10| We're almost home, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14890)|
| 4:08:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14893)|
| 4:08:14| Agenda item 39, applicant Shuler Crew Construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14894)|
| 4:08:18| Location west side of Laurel Point Lane, south of Coward Mill Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14898)|
| 4:08:23| Approximate size track, 12,761 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14903)|
| 4:08:29| Zoning planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14909)|
| 4:08:31| Existing land use, single family residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14911)|
| 4:08:33| Proposed use, peripheral setback reduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14913)|
| 4:08:39| Density proposed, three dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14919)|
| 4:08:45| This will require one motion and the staff recommendations to approve the development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14925)|
| 4:08:50| to reduce the peripheral setback from 35 feet to 22.5 feet in planned residential zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14930)|
| 4:08:57| as depicted on the site plan, subject to the noted two conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14937)|
| 4:09:01| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14941)|
| 4:09:11| Do we have opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14951)|
| 4:09:14| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14954)|
| 4:09:21| Please proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14961)|
| 4:09:22| I'm Karen Bricken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14962)|
| 4:09:23| On behalf of Shuler Construction, Mr. Phillips became ill earlier today and had to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14963)|
| 4:09:28| I'm also the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14968)|
| 4:09:30| And the request is to reduce the peripheral setback from 35 feet to 22.5 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14970)|
| 4:09:39| to allow us to put a screened-in porch on the back of the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14979)|
| 4:09:44| We do not enjoy the setback that the internal lots enjoy of 15 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14984)|
| 4:09:50| However, with our combined setback and the distance to Reagan Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14990)|
| 4:09:55| they're still about 55 feet from the back of the structure we proposed to Reagan Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=14995)|
| 4:10:05| The reason that our house sits back a little further from what I'm told by the homeowners association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15005)|
| 4:10:11| is that the original entrance into the development was slot 38.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15011)|
| 4:10:18| And when that was not allowed, then they put a house on that, which moved our house back in the planning stages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15018)|
| 4:10:27| There was a previous, and you can see it in that picture, it's white,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15027)|
| 4:10:31| there was a previous structure on the back of the house, a covered porch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15031)|
| 4:10:36| Apparently it was not permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15036)|
| 4:10:38| We've owned the house for about a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15038)|
| 4:10:40| We didn't know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15040)|
| 4:10:41| That has been torn down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15041)|
| 4:10:45| The lot coverage with the planned addition is 32%, which meets Knox County's maximum of 50%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15045)|
| 4:10:53| There will be no encroachment onto the TVA transmission line, which cuts across the very back corner of the lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15053)|
| 4:11:02| We have HOA approval of the plans for the structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15062)|
| 4:11:07| and it is the only available outdoor venue for my husband, who is handicapped,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15067)|
| 4:11:13| and part of this construction will allow us to put a handicapped entrance exit into the back of the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15073)|
| 4:11:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15083)|
| 4:11:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15084)|
| 4:11:26| Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15086)|
| 4:11:31| I think this is kind of a tough one, but I'm going to make a motion to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15091)|
| 4:11:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15096)|
| 4:11:37| Can I second that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15097)|
| 4:11:38| Unless everybody wants to discuss it for a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15098)|
| 4:11:39| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15099)|
| 4:11:41| I ask Chair, would you like to comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15101)|
| 4:11:43| Other than I had my light on before Logan, and he got to move previous questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15103)|
| 4:11:50| That's the chair's prerogative to pick the order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15110)|
| 4:11:55| Do you have a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15115)|
| 4:11:57| Well, that was it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15117)|
| 4:11:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15118)|
| 4:12:00| So we have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15120)|
| 4:12:03| Let's see, who made the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15123)|
| 4:12:04| Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15124)|

| 4:12:12| I've lost my place now because of Vice Chair Eaton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15132)|
| 4:12:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15137)|
| 4:12:18| To approve the development plan to reduce a peripheral setback per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15138)|
| 4:12:24| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15144)|
| 4:12:26| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15146)|

| 4:12:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15150)|
| 4:12:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15151)|
| 4:12:32| Moving on to some other business here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15152)|
| 4:12:34| It's time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15154)|
| 4:12:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15155)|
| 4:12:36| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15156)|

| 4:12:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15158)|
| 4:12:39| Are you all waiting for 48, item 48?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15159)|
| 4:12:44| Yes, they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15164)|
| 4:12:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15166)|
| 4:12:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15167)|
| 4:12:48| Let's move to item 47 and quickly get beyond it so that we can get to 48.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15168)|
| 4:12:54| So it's that time in the year to where I am appointing a nominating committee to present| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15174)|
| 4:13:02| a slate of officers for the 2023-2024 term at the May 11th, 2023 Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15182)|
| 4:13:09| meeting and I would like to ask Commissioner Phillips, Commissioner Roth, and Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15189)|
| 4:13:13| Boyer to take on that task if you would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15193)|
| 4:13:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15196)|
| 4:13:17| What's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15197)|
| 4:13:18| He's going to be rolling off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15198)|
| 4:13:21| Oh, yeah, we can put him on that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15201)|
| 4:13:25| Yeah, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15205)|
| 4:13:26| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15206)|
| 4:13:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15207)|
| 4:13:28| Let's go to item 48.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15208)|
| 4:13:29| Item 48.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15209)|
| 4:13:31| Item 48.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15211)|
| 4:13:33| Staff recommendation is this is regarding a similar use determination for a metal recycling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15213)|
| 4:13:39| business in the industrial zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15219)|
| 4:13:42| Staff recommendation approve the use classification for the metal recycling business described| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15222)|
| 4:13:46| in the description of operations exhibit A as a use permitted on review in the industrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15226)|
| 4:13:52| zone and I'll let Mr. Reynolds take it from here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15232)|
| 4:13:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15238)|
| 4:13:59| So we went over this at the general review meeting but just real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15239)|
| 4:14:03| So this is a similar use determination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15243)|
| 4:14:06| There was not a clear listed use for the, for what they're wanting to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15246)|
| 4:14:14| So, but the industrial zone is obviously the most intense zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15254)|
| 4:14:19| This is an intense use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15259)|
| 4:14:20| It should be allowed in the industrial zone in our opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15260)|
| 4:14:23| It's just a matter of whether it's more closely related to permitted uses in the industrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15263)|
| 4:14:27| zone or uses permitted on, or those uses listed as a use permitted on review in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15267)|
| 4:14:32| industrial zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15272)|
| 4:14:34| In staff's opinion, it's more closely related to a use permitted on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15274)|
| 4:14:41| And I can go into more detail if you'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15281)|
| 4:14:43| It's outlined in the report but I'd be happy to answer any questions about our recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15283)|
| 4:14:51| The question is just we're voting on whether this should be a use on review or by right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15291)|
| 4:14:58| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15298)|
| 4:14:59| I mean technically you could say that this doesn't really fit in the industrial zone at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15299)|
| 4:15:02| and it really fits in something else but in reality this is really an appropriate zone for the use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15302)|
| 4:15:08| It's just a matter of how it should be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15308)|
| 4:15:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15313)|
| 4:15:14| The applicants are present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15314)|

| 4:15:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15318)|

| 4:15:21| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15321)|
| 4:15:22| If you'll state your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15322)|
| 4:15:23| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15323)|
| 4:15:24| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15324)|
| 4:15:25| I'm Lydia Crabtree and this is Anthony Dickens who is a process safety person, sorry, process person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15325)|
| 4:15:33| And we're representing the property at 2609 Asbury Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15333)|
| 4:15:40| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15340)|
| 4:15:43| I don't see anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15343)|
| 4:15:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15346)|
| 4:15:47| Please proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15347)|
| 4:15:48| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15348)|
| 4:15:49| So just to very briefly describe, this process is going to be a metal reclamation style facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15349)|
| 4:15:58| They will be receiving residue that has been shredded up at other metal sorting recycling facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15358)|
| 4:16:07| Including Nextdoor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15367)|
| 4:16:08| Including, yes, thank you, including Nextdoor at SA Recyclers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15368)|
| 4:16:13| So they will be providing, SA Recyclers will be providing the material that will be used at the Tom Paul Knoxville facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15373)|
| 4:16:24| So this process is proprietary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15384)|
| 4:16:27| It's a very interesting and cool way of getting metals out of the shredded material to keep it from going into the landfill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15387)|
| 4:16:36| and to put it back into the consumer stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15396)|
| 4:16:39| And the process, as though it's proprietary, the equipment is very similar to that that's already in your approved list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15399)|
| 4:16:49| such as landfill facilities, mining facilities, and some metal manufacturing facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15409)|
| 4:16:57| Our process, we would argue, is even less intrusive to the environment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15417)|
| 4:17:04| because we will not be digging into the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15424)|
| 4:17:09| All of our materials will be stored on surface level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15429)|
| 4:17:13| We won't have equipment with substantial coolant or oil-based materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15433)|
| 4:17:19| Most of the process is going to operate with water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15439)|
| 4:17:24| So if you guys have any questions, we'd be happy to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15444)|
| 4:17:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15449)|
| 4:17:30| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15450)|
| 4:17:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15451)|
| 4:17:32| I have to give just a brief synopsis of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15452)|
| 4:17:36| It's a wet process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15456)|
| 4:17:38| You have next door is a shredder that produces dust and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15458)|
| 4:17:45| So this is a wet process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15465)|
| 4:17:46| We're separating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15466)|
| 4:17:48| We intercept the auto-shredder residue, the fluff that they're going to take to landfill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15468)|
| 4:17:53| and we just remove the remaining metals out of that fluff through a wet process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15473)|
| 4:18:01| settling screws and stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15481)|
| 4:18:03| So we're working with screw conveyors, belt conveyors, feeders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15483)|
| 4:18:09| various typical industrial equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15489)|
| 4:18:12| It's just a unique process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15492)|
| 4:18:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15494)|
| 4:18:16| Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15496)|
| 4:18:18| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15498)|
| 4:18:20| Well, I didn't mean to have my light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15500)|
| 4:18:24| You know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15504)|
| 4:18:25| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15505)|
| 4:18:26| I have a thought, but I'll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15506)|
| 4:18:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15507)|
| 4:18:28| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15508)|
| 4:18:29| Just one quick question, and since you said it is a wet process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15509)|
| 4:18:31| I remember in a gender review the other day, once everything's shredded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15511)|
| 4:18:35| I think it said it was a covered bunker where all the stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15515)|
| 4:18:38| So my only question is because it just triggered my mind that computers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15518)|
| 4:18:42| and things like that could also be shredded, which I know it's very fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15522)|
| 4:18:46| but mercury does exist in some of those computers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15526)|
| 4:18:49| So in the water filtration process, are you able to get all of the mercury out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15529)|
| 4:18:53| I just want to make sure nothing is being released,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15533)|
| 4:18:55| especially as close as you are to the river there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15535)|
| 4:18:57| that nothing is being put back in that could potentially harm our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15537)|
| 4:19:01| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15541)|
| 4:19:02| So the pad location for all the equipment is all funneled to four different sumps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15542)|
| 4:19:12| so our process water is completely captured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15552)|
| 4:19:18| We collect rainwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15558)|
| 4:19:19| We'll be trying to collect all the rainwater we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15559)|
| 4:19:22| so we don't have to pull out from the well or ask the city for water for the make-up water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15562)|
| 4:19:32| We'll end up putting a couple of 20-foot diameter, 20-foot tall tanks on site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15572)|
| 4:19:38| 200,000 gallons apiece, to collect as much of the rainwater, stormwater, as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15578)|
| 4:19:46| I know that just the 100-year flood, I believe, in that area is 200,000 gallons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15586)|
| 4:19:57| So I was wanting the pad to hold double that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15597)|
| 4:20:00| and the two water tanks to essentially hold double that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15600)|
| 4:20:06| Excessive capacity for water holding for production as well as for storm events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15606)|
| 4:20:15| The water will have to be tested regularly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15615)|
| 4:20:20| Sorry, speak into the mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15620)|
| 4:20:23| I was just going to clarify, we are already talking with TDEC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15623)|
| 4:20:28| and so we understand that we will need to design a process for characterizing our water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15628)|
| 4:20:35| and verifying that it is okay to discharge in the event that we have to have an emergency discharge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15635)|
| 4:20:43| But as Anthony was pointing out, the facility should operate at a net water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15643)|
| 4:20:50| Commissioner Schell, I move to approve the use classification for this recycling business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15650)|
| 4:20:55| as a use permitted on review as per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15655)|
| 4:21:01| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15661)|
| 4:21:02| We've got a motion to approve as a use on review by Commissioner Schell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15662)|
| 4:21:07| So seconded by Commissioner Levinson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15667)|
| 4:21:11| One other comment I want to make sure, and I know it's late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15671)|
| 4:21:15| Mr. Reynolds, we had talked something about some, could be potential excessive noise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15675)|
| 4:21:21| and there could be conditions placed on this to mitigate the noise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15681)|
| 4:21:25| I guess I could point to the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15685)|
| 4:21:28| You mentioned that there is a, the ball mill is part of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15688)|
| 4:21:35| And I know that that was a pretty noisy operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15695)|
| 4:21:39| This was intended to be inside and there's ways to mitigate noise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15699)|
| 4:21:42| and see how you can address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15702)|
| 4:21:45| Yes, and this is something we can include in additional information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15705)|
| 4:21:52| We were able to pull noise data from a facility that operates similar equipment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15712)|
| 4:22:00| in a similar setup as this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15720)|
| 4:22:04| The noise sampling is not exactly apples to apples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15724)|
| 4:22:08| They were monitoring employee exposure levels rather than noise mapping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15728)|
| 4:22:13| However, we can extrapolate from that data that the nearest place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15733)|
| 4:22:22| where the location of the equipment would be close to the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15742)|
| 4:22:28| at the road we would already be down below 67 decibels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15748)|
| 4:22:33| So while the equipment can be noisy, we will have engineering controls in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15753)|
| 4:22:42| such as lining inside the ball mill, which will keep it from being quite as noisy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15762)|
| 4:22:48| And then just based on data that we have, it should not be a significant issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15768)|
| 4:22:56| Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15776)|
| 4:22:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15777)|
| 4:22:58| That was very in line with what I was thinking when we first started discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15778)|
| 4:23:07| And I was going to ask, because I believe in agenda review it was mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15787)|
| 4:23:11| that it's a 24-hour process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15791)|
| 4:23:13| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15793)|
| 4:23:16| Yeah, they can run it 20 hours a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15796)|
| 4:23:20| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15800)|
| 4:23:22| He asked if it's going to be run 24 hours a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15802)|
| 4:23:26| I believe they will plan on doing two shifts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15806)|
| 4:23:28| Yeah, I think the initial startup is to do two eight-hour shifts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15808)|
| 4:23:33| So it could at some point become operational 24 hours a day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15813)|
| 4:23:40| if that is not the current plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15820)|
| 4:23:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15822)|
| 4:23:43| And if I understand correctly, Mike, with this approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15823)|
| 4:23:46| then they will come back with a use-on-review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15826)|
| 4:23:49| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15829)|
| 4:23:50| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15830)|
| 4:23:51| If the termination that this should be considered a use-permitted on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15831)|
| 4:23:56| will come back through use-on-review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15836)|
| 4:23:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15838)|
| 4:23:59| So I would just say during that use-on-review process, especially with the noise levels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15839)|
| 4:24:04| I think it would be really good to even with not just looking at the measurements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15844)|
| 4:24:11| and the calculations you have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15851)|
| 4:24:13| but also trying to make some efforts for active noise prevention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15853)|
| 4:24:19| from neighboring properties and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15859)|
| 4:24:23| And especially if it's going to be a round-the-clock type of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15863)|
| 4:24:28| So that's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15868)|
| 4:24:30| We've got a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15870)|
| 4:24:32| Motion and a second to approve per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15872)|
| 4:24:38| Seeing no other likes, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15878)|
| 4:24:41| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15881)|
| 4:24:42| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15882)|
| 4:24:43| Motion carries and we are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=15883)|
