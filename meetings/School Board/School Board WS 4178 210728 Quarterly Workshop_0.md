| 0:02:32| Thank you, and I would like to refer to Superintendent Thomas for his report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=152)|
| 0:02:36| Thank you, Madam Chair, members of the board. I have a few updates for you this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=156)|
| 0:02:40| To begin, I hope that everyone is enjoying their break and has had a chance to rest and relax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=160)|
| 0:02:45| Summer is an important time to recharge your batteries and spend time with loved ones, so I'm hopeful that our KCS employees have been taking advantage of this opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=165)|
| 0:02:53| At the same time, our fall semester is just around the corner, can you believe it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=173)|
| 0:02:58| And I want students and families to know that KCS is working very hard to be ready, and we will be ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=178)|
| 0:03:03| With that in mind, I did want to highlight two events that took place recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=183)|
| 0:03:07| Earlier this month, our elementary and secondary principals gathered for our annual two-day training session called the Principals Institute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=187)|
| 0:03:14| This event was at Bearden High School, and I was very pleased that our principals not only received important updates and training, but also were inspired by an outstanding guest speaker, Dr. Adolph Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=194)|
| 0:03:25| Families will be receiving important back-to-school updates from their school principals soon, so please be on the lookout for that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=205)|
| 0:03:34| Also, please take a moment to thank our principals and assistant principals for their leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=214)|
| 0:03:39| In addition, KCS this week is hosting our new Teacher's Academy, an orientation event for teachers who are beginning their education career or are joining KCS from another district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=219)|
| 0:03:50| I had the opportunity to attend the academy this morning with our elementary teachers, and tomorrow we'll attend with our secondary teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=230)|
| 0:03:58| And I was very encouraged by the enthusiasm and energy of our new educators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=238)|
| 0:04:02| As I said to them this morning, I think KCS is the very best school district they could have chosen, and hopefully they feel the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=242)|
| 0:04:09| I'm certainly confident after meeting these teachers that they are extremely talented and will be tremendous assets to our students, families, and communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=249)|
| 0:04:17| I do want to remind families that our first half day of class is on Monday, August 9th, and we look forward to seeing all our students on the 9th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=257)|
| 0:04:26| Madam Chair, members of the board, this concludes my report for this evening. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=266)|
| 0:04:30| Thank you, Superintendent Thomas. And if you want to go ahead and introduce our program, that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=270)|
| 0:04:35| Yes, my pleasure. Thank you, Madam Chair, members of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=275)|
| 0:04:40| I'd like to take a moment to introduce our guests who will be presenting this evening, Jane Heiple and Donna Gillick from Ford Next Generation of Learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=280)|
| 0:04:48| Ford is a nationally recognized organization that leverages the power of community partnerships to prepare students for post-secondary success in both college and careers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=288)|
| 0:04:58| We've been working with them for over the last five months to get a better understanding of the strengths of our school district, as well as areas where we can improve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=298)|
| 0:05:07| I had the opportunity to meet with Jane and Donna this afternoon in person, finally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=307)|
| 0:05:11| I'll have to say they're very personable and friendly on the screen, but even more so in person, so I want to thank them for their time this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=311)|
| 0:05:21| We get to hear tonight a little bit more about the successful work that they've been a part of in more than 40 communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=321)|
| 0:05:27| I was also very proud to hear from them about how welcoming, engaged, and caring our students, family, staff, and community have been since our work began with Ford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=327)|
| 0:05:36| It's always nice to hear from others, reaffirming what many of us already know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=336)|
| 0:05:40| I'm grateful for Jane and Donna for being here tonight and sharing with you their report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=340)|
| 0:05:45| I think you will find it interesting, and I hope that you will consider continuing this work, which has been graciously funded by the Knox Education Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=345)|
| 0:05:53| I would be remiss if I did not thank Chris Lesoth, President and Chief Executive Officer for the Knoxville Education Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=353)|
| 0:06:01| Chris, thank you very much for all the work that you and your team have done to get us to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=361)|
| 0:06:08| At this time, I'd like to turn it over to our Assistant Superintendent and Chief Academic Officer, Dr. John Roswick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=368)|
| 0:06:20| Thank you, Superintendent Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=380)|
| 0:06:22| I guess it's on. I'm just the wrong height for it. Maybe that's where it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=382)|
| 0:06:27| Thank you very much. We are excited tonight, and as Superintendent Thomas said, to have Donna and Jane here in person to be able to share this with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=387)|
| 0:06:37| I just want to set a little context around what you're getting ready to hear before we start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=397)|
| 0:06:42| When I look in the crowd, I see Amy and Owen here from the Chamber, Chris who's been here, Keith Wilson who's been a big part of this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=402)|
| 0:06:51| Really, a couple years ago, we just began trying to think through Danny Trent back there, too, and his team on the secondary side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=411)|
| 0:06:58| How do we get the most out of our high schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=418)|
| 0:07:01| Do we have a system in place that every student's getting everything that they need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=421)|
| 0:07:06| All the counseling they need for that, all the experiences they need for that, and just what does that look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=426)|
| 0:07:11| Really, we began looking at different schools and different folks that did things different ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=431)|
| 0:07:17| One place we went, we were aware of Ford's work and went to Nashville and have sent different groups to go see different sets of principals to go see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=437)|
| 0:07:25| I think maybe some of you on the board have been able to do that, some folks from the mayor's office and places, just to kind of see what that looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=445)|
| 0:07:33| Really, I wanted to say on the front side of this, this is not something the state's requiring us to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=453)|
| 0:07:38| We've talked so much about requirements and all those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=458)|
| 0:07:41| This is really just us as a district looking at ourselves and saying, how can we be better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=461)|
| 0:07:46| How can we do better things for kids and for students to give them the opportunities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=466)|
| 0:07:50| Really, it's more than just the school system. It really will be the entire community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=470)|
| 0:07:55| We've had a few meetings today with both mayors and kind of having some conversations with them around what this work could look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=475)|
| 0:08:02| It will definitely involve more than the school system as we kind of see what we want to build out for our folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=482)|
| 0:08:08| Again, conversations started with the chamber years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=488)|
| 0:08:12| It's kind of nice to see this to fruition with Kef's support, being able to bring Ford in for this exploratory work to kind of get a feel for our schools and look at what we can do better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=492)|
| 0:08:22| what we can do better at the high school level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=502)|
| 0:08:24| And that will matriculate down to what we do better at middle schools and elementary schools so that we can make sure not just students who have resource or have connections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=504)|
| 0:08:32| but that every student has a process that we can be intentional about as they graduate and go beyond graduation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=512)|
| 0:08:38| So, with that, we're excited for them to report out to you, kind of explore what they've seen at the ground level, kind of our current status of where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=518)|
| 0:08:45| So, I'm going to turn it over to Donna and Jane at this point. So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=525)|
| 0:08:53| That's a good question. So, on the slides for the presentation, I'm not sure how this works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=533)|
| 0:08:59| Can we pull it up and then do we have a signal for advancement? Is it cough or just go to the next slide?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=539)|
| 0:09:07| What does it say, go to the next slide, if that works? Okay, good deal. Thank you. Here's Donna.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=547)|
| 0:09:13| Well, good evening, members of the board, Superintendent Thomas, and guests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=553)|
| 0:09:18| First, I just want to thank you for having the opportunity for Jane and I to come and present our findings from our Explorer visit, and we'll get to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=558)|
| 0:09:27| but to really just welcome all of us with open arms into your community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=567)|
| 0:09:33| But before we introduce ourselves, I want to tell you what a pleasure it's been to get to know your community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=573)|
| 0:09:40| That's your teachers, your principals, your school staff, your students, and your business and civic partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=580)|
| 0:09:49| They have just been an absolute thrill to get to know and to work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=589)|
| 0:09:54| And one thing is clear, Knox County truly cares about their students and setting them up for success,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=594)|
| 0:10:01| and that became very clear as we met with everyone, that you're truly invested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=601)|
| 0:10:08| And, you know, we always want to focus on students in everything we do, and so I want to tell you a little story before we get started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=608)|
| 0:10:15| I think it was our very first focus group, and I want to think it was Bearden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=615)|
| 0:10:20| but we hadn't been off our focus group since we had to do all this virtual, I bet maybe an hour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=620)|
| 0:10:25| when we got an email from a group of students, and they said they just wanted to thank us for listening to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=625)|
| 0:10:31| And I think that very email set the stage for this work, and we haven't been disappointed since,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=631)|
| 0:10:37| that we're in a community that truly cares about the students, the students really want to do well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=637)|
| 0:10:44| and so we hope that that email sort of, I know it has propelled us into the work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=644)|
| 0:10:50| and we hope tonight's presentation will just be the foundation of our future work together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=650)|
| 0:10:55| But let's just start with introductions, and I'm going to ask Jane to come up and introduce herself first, and then I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=655)|
| 0:11:03| Thanks, Donna. It's great to be in Knoxville. I will tell you this is my first road trip in a year and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=663)|
| 0:11:11| Ford grounded us for a year and a half from being able to travel to any of the communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=671)|
| 0:11:16| It's been a little nerve-wracking for me. I couldn't figure out what to put in my suitcase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=676)|
| 0:11:19| I couldn't figure out what pair of pants to put on. It's just been a crazy kind of day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=679)|
| 0:11:23| but just glad Knoxville's our first trip. So again, my name is Jane Heiple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=683)|
| 0:11:26| I serve as a community coach with Ford Next Generation Learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=686)|
| 0:11:29| I've been with Ford about five years now as a community coach, but my background is in public education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=689)|
| 0:11:36| I have been everything from a teacher through administrator in Pennsylvania,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=696)|
| 0:11:40| and I'm sure you can tell right now I am not from Tennessee, as my colleague is from Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=700)|
| 0:11:45| So I live in the southwestern corner of Pennsylvania, just a little bit outside of Pittsburgh, about 45 minutes east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=705)|
| 0:11:52| And yes, I am a Steeler fan. I know I have a fellow Steeler fan sitting there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=712)|
| 0:11:55| and hopefully we have a few more sitting in the room tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=715)|
| 0:11:59| Outside my public education life, I've also worked with the Pittsburgh Technology Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=719)|
| 0:12:04| which is a large trade association, where I managed all their business education partnership programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=724)|
| 0:12:10| I also currently have my own company right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=730)|
| 0:12:13| I do a lot of consulting work for the Pennsylvania Department of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=733)|
| 0:12:16| I've worked with the mayor's office in Pittsburgh and multiple entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=736)|
| 0:12:19| I also had the privilege of teaching at the post-secondary level at Carnegie Mellon in Penn State| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=739)|
| 0:12:24| and preparing educational leaders for the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=744)|
| 0:12:28| But again, couldn't be more happy to be in Knoxville and really excited to present our findings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=748)|
| 0:12:33| So Donna.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=753)|
| 0:12:35| Thank you, Jane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=755)|
| 0:12:37| My name is Donna Gilley, and I've spent my entire educational career really helping building systems and structures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=757)|
| 0:12:44| for young people to achieve what's within them, to find that hope and dream and be successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=764)|
| 0:12:52| I taught in an academy classroom for the first 15 years of my career,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=772)|
| 0:12:57| and then I shifted to the district office where I have helped shape the academies of Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=777)|
| 0:13:03| to be successful over the last 15 years and hopefully sustainable into the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=783)|
| 0:13:09| In addition to my career in the district, I have worked as a trainer and a coach for Ford NGL for several years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=789)|
| 0:13:19| more of a trainer and a consultant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=799)|
| 0:13:21| But then I just recently retired from full-time employment in Nashville and now get to serve as a coach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=801)|
| 0:13:26| And I can't tell you how thrilled I am that Knoxville gets to be one of my first communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=806)|
| 0:13:31| So it is a thrill to be here with you this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=811)|
| 0:13:35| And now we're going to jump in and talk a little bit about what Ford NGL is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=815)|
| 0:13:40| One more slide up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=820)|
| 0:13:43| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=823)|
| 0:13:44| And before we jump into the findings, I want to just talk a little bit about Ford NGL, the organization and the model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=824)|
| 0:13:53| And I can tell you that it is truly, as the slide says, a community-connected learning model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=833)|
| 0:14:00| Now, you might ask yourself what that means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=840)|
| 0:14:02| Well, I first want to tell you what it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=842)|
| 0:14:05| It doesn't mean that the community is going to come in and tell you how to run your house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=845)|
| 0:14:09| And it also is not a program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=849)|
| 0:14:11| It is truly a community-connected model where we help bring in all stakeholders in a community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=851)|
| 0:14:21| parents, students, educators, business partners, foundation partners, civic partners, post-secondary partners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=861)|
| 0:14:30| to come together and to envision what they want to see for their community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=870)|
| 0:14:36| so that it becomes the community students, not just the school districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=876)|
| 0:14:42| And they really envision that transformation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=882)|
| 0:14:46| And you may ask, well, what would that look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=886)|
| 0:14:49| What would external partners do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=889)|
| 0:14:51| And sometimes we refer to that to the three A's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=891)|
| 0:14:54| Number one, these partners are going to advocate for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=894)|
| 0:14:58| They're going to be your advocate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=898)|
| 0:15:00| They're also going to assist you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=900)|
| 0:15:04| They're going to assist in that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=904)|
| 0:15:07| But they're also going to advise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=907)|
| 0:15:09| And so those three A's, that's what these partners will do, advocate, advise, and roll up their sleeves and assist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=909)|
| 0:15:17| So it truly is a community-connected approach where all stakeholders come together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=917)|
| 0:15:24| to have shared ownership and responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=924)|
| 0:15:27| And each organization will have its own set of roles and responsibilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=927)|
| 0:15:32| so that this work is very strategic, it's intentional, and it's planned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=932)|
| 0:15:38| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=938)|
| 0:15:40| And so on this slide, I wanted to first say that one of the first things we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=940)|
| 0:15:45| when we go into a community is we look you in the eye and say, why do you want to change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=945)|
| 0:15:50| Well, on this slide is really the why that we do this work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=950)|
| 0:15:55| because we want to lead all communities to the things that you see up here on this screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=955)|
| 0:16:01| Now, I think you probably have a packet, or if not, the chair is going to get you one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=961)|
| 0:16:06| but you're going to see that you are now going to be part of 43 communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=966)|
| 0:16:11| from across the United States and the United Kingdom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=971)|
| 0:16:15| that are all working on similar transformational goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=975)|
| 0:16:19| And on the graph on the slide, you're going to see some of the outcomes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=979)|
| 0:16:23| that we have consistently seen across all of those 43 communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=983)|
| 0:16:29| that we want to ensure that young people are prepared for college, career, and life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=989)|
| 0:16:36| to see shared prosperity, community prosperity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=996)|
| 0:16:40| so that all of the community, not parts, but all of the community have prosperity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1000)|
| 0:16:46| to assist in strengthening that talent pipeline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1006)|
| 0:16:49| to ensure that our businesses have the talent from our schools to be the future employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1009)|
| 0:16:57| One of the most important things we stress is to make sure that equity and student voice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1017)|
| 0:17:02| is at the center of all of our work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1022)|
| 0:17:05| And then finally, to work with a community to build capacity to continue this work and go further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1025)|
| 0:17:12| So these are some of the outcomes that we have seen consistently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1032)|
| 0:17:16| across the 43 communities in which we've worked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1036)|
| 0:17:20| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1040)|
| 0:17:22| And so as you all know, and Superintendent Thomas mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1042)|
| 0:17:26| we spent the last five or six months in Knoxville doing what we call the Explorer Visit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1046)|
| 0:17:32| And really, that was a time for us to get to know you as a community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1052)|
| 0:17:37| but also for you to get to know us, to see what Ford NGL is all about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1057)|
| 0:17:43| to decide if we wanted to take this work further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1063)|
| 0:17:47| We've been able, and Jane's going to talk you through the report in just a few moments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1067)|
| 0:17:51| but we've been able to host over 50 work sessions, focus groups where we've talked to teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1071)|
| 0:17:57| parents, students, business partners, community partners, post-secondary partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1077)|
| 0:18:04| And so in just a few moments, Jane will share that report with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1084)|
| 0:18:08| But before that happens, if you'll look at the next slide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1088)|
| 0:18:11| these were the four things that we were really looking for in each one of those conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1091)|
| 0:18:17| We were looking for commitment, for capacity, the current status of what's going on in your schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1097)|
| 0:18:25| and most importantly, readiness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1105)|
| 0:18:28| And what I can tell you is Knox County met and exceeded all four of those goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1108)|
| 0:18:36| On the next slide, I'm going to show you just a very quick look at the timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1116)|
| 0:18:40| So again, we've been in the community since February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1120)|
| 0:18:44| You can see on the screen here some of the timeframes that we've worked with your community and school teams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1124)|
| 0:18:51| And now what I'd like to do is turn it over to Jane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1131)|
| 0:18:54| and she's going to walk you through the process that we took and some of the findings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1134)|
| 0:19:00| Jane?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1140)|
| 0:19:06| Thanks, Dawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1146)|
| 0:19:08| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1148)|
| 0:19:10| So as Dawn has said, I'm going to walk you through our actual explore visit to Knox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1150)|
| 0:19:15| Again, over the past about five months we've been here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1155)|
| 0:19:20| And what Dawn didn't tell you is we call this our dating phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1160)|
| 0:19:23| We kind of get to know each other and figure out whether we're going to get to move on to the next step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1163)|
| 0:19:27| And we actually had a very successful dating phase, I will tell you that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1167)|
| 0:19:31| But what did we do during these months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1171)|
| 0:19:33| Well, we used a variety of methods to look at all types of data and information from Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1173)|
| 0:19:39| We looked at a variety of reports, workforce trends, industry trends, student achievement surveys, CTE programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1179)|
| 0:19:47| But the most important information that we gathered were from the 50-plus focus groups that we met with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1187)|
| 0:19:53| We conducted focus groups at all of your high schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1193)|
| 0:19:56| We met with students, teachers, parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1196)|
| 0:19:59| We met with the KCS district leaders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1199)|
| 0:20:01| We met with school board members, high school leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1201)|
| 0:20:06| And we also met with business and community leaders, post-secondary institution representatives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1206)|
| 0:20:11| and the Knox Ed Foundation members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1211)|
| 0:20:13| I'm just curious, how many of you participated in one of our focus groups?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1213)|
| 0:20:17| I recognize faces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1217)|
| 0:20:18| Great, perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1218)|
| 0:20:19| So you understand what we were doing at the focus groups, which was very, very powerful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1219)|
| 0:20:23| And our job was to listen, listen, and listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1223)|
| 0:20:26| Again, to learn everything we could through those focus groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1226)|
| 0:20:30| So what were some of those questions we asked?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1230)|
| 0:20:32| Well, first of all, what do you like and dislike about the schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1232)|
| 0:20:36| That was a key question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1236)|
| 0:20:40| And I'll tell you, the kids were amazingly honest with us, very transparent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1240)|
| 0:20:48| They really, really loved their schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1248)|
| 0:20:52| But I could tell you that they have some concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1252)|
| 0:20:55| They'd like to see some changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1255)|
| 0:20:56| And they told us about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1256)|
| 0:20:57| And I'll talk a little bit about that as I go through the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1257)|
| 0:21:00| But we love meeting with the kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1260)|
| 0:21:02| But their biggest message to us is they're worried about some of the other kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1262)|
| 0:21:06| and what they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1266)|
| 0:21:08| We asked students, teachers, and parents about career advising and career development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1268)|
| 0:21:14| how that was happening in the classroom, how students were acquiring career information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1274)|
| 0:21:19| And then I always play a game, especially with the kids, and I wave my magic wand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1279)|
| 0:21:23| and I say, I'm going to make you the – you have all the power that you need right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1283)|
| 0:21:29| to make a change at the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1289)|
| 0:21:31| What would that be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1291)|
| 0:21:32| And we get great information that way because they really take that very thoughtfully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1292)|
| 0:21:36| and seriously, parents, students, teachers, everybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1296)|
| 0:21:39| whenever they have that power to make that change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1299)|
| 0:21:42| So that's something we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1302)|
| 0:21:43| But as I take it away, I just want you to know that they still don't have that power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1303)|
| 0:21:46| So that power has been taken back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1306)|
| 0:21:48| And then we asked the business community about their current levels of engagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1308)|
| 0:21:52| How do they engage and how are they interested in engaging with the school district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1312)|
| 0:21:57| So next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1317)|
| 0:22:00| So our findings goes through strengths, challenges, and recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1320)|
| 0:22:04| And by the way, Knox County and Knox County schools are doing amazingly great things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1324)|
| 0:22:10| and we were super impressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1330)|
| 0:22:12| As you can see by this slide, your leadership is outstanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1332)|
| 0:22:16| We're fortunate enough that weekly we meet with the key leadership team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1336)|
| 0:22:21| We meet with John, Keith, Salid, Tommy, Danny, Carly, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1341)|
| 0:22:28| They're all part of that team right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1348)|
| 0:22:30| And they are just so committed and passionate to all of this work that we're about to undertake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1350)|
| 0:22:35| Great school culture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1355)|
| 0:22:37| First thing that everybody told us, our schools are great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1357)|
| 0:22:39| We have great culture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1359)|
| 0:22:40| We have a welcoming environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1360)|
| 0:22:42| Teachers love us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1362)|
| 0:22:43| That's what the kids told us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1363)|
| 0:22:44| The teachers love teaching here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1364)|
| 0:22:47| Teachers understand the need to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1367)|
| 0:22:50| They see the world changing, and they feel that they need to change too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1370)|
| 0:22:54| So they really have the ability to think about change and transformation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1374)|
| 0:22:58| You already have high levels of academic achievement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1378)|
| 0:23:02| And then last, you have a very committed group of business, community, and civic leaders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1382)|
| 0:23:08| and especially the leadership at the Ed Knox Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1388)|
| 0:23:11| Now we walk into a lot of our communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1391)|
| 0:23:13| and there is no one organization that's emerging as a leader to be what we call a convening org.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1393)|
| 0:23:18| But I'll tell you, this Knox Educating Foundation, under the guidance of Chris, is a fantastic group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1398)|
| 0:23:24| They are so committed to providing the resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1404)|
| 0:23:27| not only the monetary resources to commit transformation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1407)|
| 0:23:30| but the people it takes for the transformation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1410)|
| 0:23:33| And they're also very willing to engage that broader business community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1413)|
| 0:23:37| that's needed to have community-connected learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1417)|
| 0:23:41| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1421)|
| 0:23:43| And as with every district, with every business, with everything we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1423)|
| 0:23:46| there's some challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1426)|
| 0:23:48| And I just want to tell you how much we admire you for taking this bold step forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1428)|
| 0:23:54| to allow us to come in and look at your district through our lens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1434)|
| 0:23:58| It's hard, because you've opened yourself up to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1438)|
| 0:24:03| You've made yourselves transparent to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1443)|
| 0:24:06| But again, we admire you for taking that bold step| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1446)|
| 0:24:09| and thinking that, yeah, we're good, but we can get better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1449)|
| 0:24:12| And that's what this is all about, is getting better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1452)|
| 0:24:15| So what are some of those things that we found?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1455)|
| 0:24:18| So understanding your challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1458)|
| 0:24:20| First of all, this is going to set you apart from other districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1460)|
| 0:24:24| because you're going to know what's happening and what your challenges are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1464)|
| 0:24:28| So equitable experiences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1468)|
| 0:24:30| We found out that not all students have access to the same experiences and opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1470)|
| 0:24:36| It varied by high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1476)|
| 0:24:38| It varied by grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1478)|
| 0:24:39| It varied by class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1479)|
| 0:24:42| We also found out that not all children have access to the supports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1482)|
| 0:24:46| and the resources that they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1486)|
| 0:24:49| The other thing about career advising, we found out again that there was not evidence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1489)|
| 0:24:54| that you have a cohesive career advising plan for the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1494)|
| 0:24:58| There were great pockets that we could point to as best practices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1498)|
| 0:25:02| but in other areas we didn't have that career advising going on for students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1502)|
| 0:25:06| And many times it was really dependent on the student being able to seek out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1506)|
| 0:25:09| their own information or stepping into the guidance counselor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1509)|
| 0:25:14| The post-secondary preparation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1514)|
| 0:25:18| It was expressed that there is a push for all students to go to college| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1518)|
| 0:25:23| and pursue post-secondary education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1523)|
| 0:25:26| And while in itself this is not a negative goal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1526)|
| 0:25:29| there's really not a plan for all students to be exposed to the type of experiences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1529)|
| 0:25:34| they need to make educated and informed decisions about post-secondary education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1534)|
| 0:25:40| And also there wasn't evidence that students were really advised on other viable options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1540)|
| 0:25:45| for post-secondary plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1545)|
| 0:25:49| Going directly to work, two-year certificate programs, apprenticeships,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1549)|
| 0:25:53| other types of very viable career options available to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1553)|
| 0:25:59| As far as the course and career pathway advisement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1559)|
| 0:26:03| again there was some limited amount of information that students received| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1563)|
| 0:26:06| regarding that career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1566)|
| 0:26:09| And those career pathways are a really important component of KCS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1569)|
| 0:26:12| but again that limited information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1572)|
| 0:26:15| So it's from a student's perspective, if I do this, then what do I do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1575)|
| 0:26:20| So we couldn't find evidence of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1580)|
| 0:26:23| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1583)|
| 0:26:26| Career challenges, career and tech ed programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1586)|
| 0:26:29| You have great career and tech ed programs here, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1589)|
| 0:26:34| And what's really interesting is your student demand is outpacing the supply,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1594)|
| 0:26:40| which means that students want CTE programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1600)|
| 0:26:43| But we also couldn't find evidence that students were really completing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1603)|
| 0:26:47| that two-year sequence of CTE courses that leads to being a completer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1607)|
| 0:26:52| And that kind of ties back into that career advising| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1612)|
| 0:26:55| and the career pathway piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1615)|
| 0:26:57| And the last one is the business and civic engagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1617)|
| 0:27:00| It's very limited in most high schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1620)|
| 0:27:03| and there really isn't a district-wide plan to assure an equitable approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1623)|
| 0:27:08| to providing students with work-based learning opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1628)|
| 0:27:12| We couldn't really define who was responsible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1632)|
| 0:27:14| for these work-based learning opportunities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1634)|
| 0:27:17| and some of those are actually secured independently by students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1637)|
| 0:27:21| without guidance from the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1641)|
| 0:27:24| And again, that was very inconsistent across the high schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1644)|
| 0:27:28| So next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1648)|
| 0:27:29| So let's go to our recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1649)|
| 0:27:31| So let's first of all talk about equitable experiences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1651)|
| 0:27:34| One of the biggest things about systems and structures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1654)|
| 0:27:37| that need to be in place to allow all students opportunities for success,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1657)|
| 0:27:42| both while they're in school and after graduation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1662)|
| 0:27:46| Retaining teachers and ability to hire teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1666)|
| 0:27:49| Teachers need to feel supported at all their schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1669)|
| 0:27:53| And when moving to a career academy model,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1673)|
| 0:27:55| that's one of the key pillars within a career academy model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1675)|
| 0:27:58| is that they're part of a family within their school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1678)|
| 0:28:01| and they feel very supported with the resources that they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1681)|
| 0:28:05| Second is the integrated career advising,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1685)|
| 0:28:08| and it's developing a system whereby all students have a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1688)|
| 0:28:13| that leads to achieving their individual goals and aspirations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1693)|
| 0:28:18| One thing we recommended was a freshman seminar course or freshman academy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1698)|
| 0:28:23| and that freshman seminar course is really about connecting academic learning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1703)|
| 0:28:28| to the real world, but at the same time being supported| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1708)|
| 0:28:32| by career development and career advising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1712)|
| 0:28:36| So they really start to understand the why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1716)|
| 0:28:39| Why do they need to learn math?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1719)|
| 0:28:41| Why do they need to learn English, science, et cetera?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1721)|
| 0:28:43| So those core courses, they're able to connect it to their why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1723)|
| 0:28:47| based on a career plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1727)|
| 0:28:49| And again, we know that freshman year is a tough year for kids, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1729)|
| 0:28:52| It's a big transition year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1732)|
| 0:28:54| So having that freshman seminar engages kids in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1734)|
| 0:28:58| And you also want to put your best teachers there too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1738)|
| 0:29:01| teaching those kids so that they want to continue on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1741)|
| 0:29:03| to the 10th, 11th, 12th grade year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1743)|
| 0:29:06| The post-secondary advising, the question we always ask is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1746)|
| 0:29:10| while students may go to college, do they actually finish?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1750)|
| 0:29:15| Or do they change options along the way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1755)|
| 0:29:18| Or they maybe finish in five or six years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1758)|
| 0:29:21| So creating systems and structures that are important so all students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1761)|
| 0:29:25| have that individualized plan to allow that seamless transition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1765)|
| 0:29:29| to post-high school opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1769)|
| 0:29:32| Not just college opportunities, but all post-high school opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1772)|
| 0:29:36| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1776)|
| 0:29:38| The career pathways, it's really about building out intentional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1778)|
| 0:29:43| and strategic pathways that are consistent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1783)|
| 0:29:48| that show those post-high school options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1788)|
| 0:29:51| So again, if I do this, then this is what I can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1791)|
| 0:29:54| So a student may choose to leave Knox County Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1794)|
| 0:29:57| and go directly into the workforce, but they may want to come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1797)|
| 0:30:00| into some type of a two-year program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1800)|
| 0:30:02| So creating those viable on-off ramps for students is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1802)|
| 0:30:05| In addition, using that 9th grade year as an exploratory year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1805)|
| 0:30:10| will really enhance their students' ability to gain strong career advising| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1810)|
| 0:30:15| and realize possibilities that exist for them in the 10th, 11th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1815)|
| 0:30:19| and 12th grade year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1819)|
| 0:30:22| Also, creating a more robust middle school communication plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1822)|
| 0:30:26| so that students are stepping into 9th grade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1826)|
| 0:30:28| having a better understanding of pathways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1828)|
| 0:30:30| and what's available to them in the high school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1830)|
| 0:30:33| When we look at the career and technical education programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1833)|
| 0:30:36| again, you currently have great CTE programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1836)|
| 0:30:39| under the direction of Keith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1839)|
| 0:30:42| But we want to look future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1842)|
| 0:30:45| What are those future opportunities in CTE?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1845)|
| 0:30:48| Also, reviewing staffing patterns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1848)|
| 0:30:50| That has the potential to serve additional students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1850)|
| 0:30:53| to meet your current levels of demand by the students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1853)|
| 0:30:56| and then also making sure that the resources align to the student demand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1856)|
| 0:31:02| And the last one is business and community engagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1862)|
| 0:31:05| As noticed in the challenge, there's no district-wide plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1865)|
| 0:31:08| to engage businesses equitably across all the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1868)|
| 0:31:12| So really a review of the current partners you have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1872)|
| 0:31:14| their level of engagement is a first step of developing a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1874)|
| 0:31:17| and a district-wide plan to engage that business community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1877)|
| 0:31:20| across all the high schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1880)|
| 0:31:23| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1883)|
| 0:31:25| So one thing we're always asked, does it work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1885)|
| 0:31:28| Does the Ford NGL process work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1888)|
| 0:31:31| So I wanted to give you some of the indicators that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1891)|
| 0:31:34| for some of our current communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1894)|
| 0:31:37| This one is from Hampton, Virginia,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1897)|
| 0:31:39| and Hampton has chosen to go to a wall-to-wall academy system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1899)|
| 0:31:42| in their high schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1902)|
| 0:31:45| This is when Hampton originally started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1905)|
| 0:31:48| They decided to use pocket academies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1908)|
| 0:31:50| which were just small learning communities within larger high schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1910)|
| 0:31:53| But they quickly looked at the data and realized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1913)|
| 0:31:57| if this is being successful with those students in pocket academies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1917)|
| 0:32:01| why wouldn't we want all students to have that success?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1921)|
| 0:32:04| So you can see what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1924)|
| 0:32:06| The suspension rate, the attendance rate, the GPAs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1926)|
| 0:32:09| But, you know, one of the really important ones here is attendance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1929)|
| 0:32:12| because if you can't get kids to school, they can't learn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1932)|
| 0:32:15| So you've got to get kids engaged in order for them to be in school and learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1935)|
| 0:32:20| So that was a big one for Hampton| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1940)|
| 0:32:22| when they looked at pocket academies versus career academies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1942)|
| 0:32:25| in more of a wall-to-wall fashion in all the high schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1945)|
| 0:32:28| And that was their decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1948)|
| 0:32:30| So next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1950)|
| 0:32:32| One thing we always look at is Algebra I proficiency and pass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1952)|
| 0:32:35| because that's a really core course, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1955)|
| 0:32:37| Algebra I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1957)|
| 0:32:39| And this was the data that Hampton, Virginia saw| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1959)|
| 0:32:42| whenever they went to a career academy model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1962)|
| 0:32:45| And I won't spend a lot of time with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1965)|
| 0:32:47| but I think all we need to look at is that upward trend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1967)|
| 0:32:50| They continued to see higher proficiency and pass percentages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1970)|
| 0:32:53| in students who were taking Algebra I once they moved to an academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1973)|
| 0:32:57| What they attributed to is students were making the connection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1977)|
| 0:33:00| to why do I need to learn Algebra?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1980)|
| 0:33:02| They had a reason to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1982)|
| 0:33:04| because they were connecting it to real-world experiences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1984)|
| 0:33:07| So again, this was just a positive trend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1987)|
| 0:33:10| that showed higher Algebra I with a career academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1990)|
| 0:33:14| So next slide, I'd like to show you Lexington,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1994)|
| 0:33:16| because this is really focused on the freshman year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1996)|
| 0:33:19| We talked about freshman seminar or freshman academy as they had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=1999)|
| 0:33:22| which meant all students were in an academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2002)|
| 0:33:24| They had a freshman seminar course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2004)|
| 0:33:26| but they were structured around academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2006)|
| 0:33:29| And you can quickly see that higher levels of...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2009)|
| 0:33:34| there were lower levels of tardies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2014)|
| 0:33:36| absences in both of these schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2016)|
| 0:33:38| This was Bryan Station and Tate's Creek High Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2018)|
| 0:33:40| in Lexington, Kentucky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2020)|
| 0:33:42| And it's all about students being in school to learn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2022)|
| 0:33:45| So that's why they were starting to see their proficiency rates raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2025)|
| 0:33:48| You see at Hampton, Lexington, the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2028)|
| 0:33:50| They saw proficiency rates being raised,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2030)|
| 0:33:52| because kids were in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2032)|
| 0:33:54| So you can see they made some tremendous strides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2034)|
| 0:33:56| and differences in those indicators of success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2036)|
| 0:33:58| And then the next slide is also from Lexington,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2038)|
| 0:34:01| which shows in-school suspensions, out of school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2041)|
| 0:34:05| from both those high schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2045)|
| 0:34:07| And you can see a significant decrease in all of those markers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2047)|
| 0:34:11| So next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2051)|
| 0:34:13| So Donna originally talked to you about what we were looking for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2053)|
| 0:34:15| when we came here, that commitment, capacity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2055)|
| 0:34:17| current status and readiness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2057)|
| 0:34:20| And as you can see, we checked the boxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2060)|
| 0:34:24| Commitment was very high here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2064)|
| 0:34:26| The capacity, tremendous capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2066)|
| 0:34:29| So this really gives you the green light to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2069)|
| 0:34:32| So what does it look like if we move forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2072)|
| 0:34:35| So next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2075)|
| 0:34:37| So you can see our roadmap, and you have that also in your packet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2077)|
| 0:34:40| in a bigger slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2080)|
| 0:34:42| And again, I just want to emphasize, Ford is not a program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2082)|
| 0:34:46| it's a process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2086)|
| 0:34:48| And if I had the technological capabilities, which I don't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2088)|
| 0:34:52| to put Knox County on that dotted line, it would be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2092)|
| 0:34:56| This is your journey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2096)|
| 0:34:57| This is your roadmap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2097)|
| 0:34:59| All of our communities go through this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2099)|
| 0:35:01| but everyone looks different because it's all about your goals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2101)|
| 0:35:04| and your outcomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2104)|
| 0:35:07| So we just finished this phase one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2107)|
| 0:35:10| and we want to work strategically and intentionally to move to these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2110)|
| 0:35:13| next levels so that all students can achieve their goals and outcomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2113)|
| 0:35:19| And I'll talk to you a little bit about this phase two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2119)|
| 0:35:21| what it's going to look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2121)|
| 0:35:23| But again, this is probably realistically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2123)|
| 0:35:26| until you get to full phase five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2126)|
| 0:35:28| we're looking at a three- to five-year process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2128)|
| 0:35:31| It just depends how fast and quickly Knox moves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2131)|
| 0:35:34| But we have a saying, slow is smooth and smooth is fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2134)|
| 0:35:38| So we like to do this intentionally with fidelity along the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2138)|
| 0:35:42| So that's an important part of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2142)|
| 0:35:44| So next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2144)|
| 0:35:45| So if we move to phase two, what's it going to look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2145)|
| 0:35:48| And I can tell you, this is where the hard work starts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2148)|
| 0:35:52| We like to say the courageous work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2152)|
| 0:35:54| because it's going to take courage to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2154)|
| 0:35:57| Anytime we change, you're going to have to make some tough decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2157)|
| 0:36:01| Some people may not like it, but you always have to come back to the why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2161)|
| 0:36:05| Why are we doing this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2165)|
| 0:36:07| So in phase two, we do several things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2167)|
| 0:36:10| First of all, we will be here, if we move to the next couple of phases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2170)|
| 0:36:14| which we will be doing, is we will be here for a full day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2174)|
| 0:36:17| with multiple stakeholders at the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2177)|
| 0:36:20| and we will be establishing a collective why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2180)|
| 0:36:24| When I talk all those stakeholders, I'm talking school, community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2184)|
| 0:36:28| post-secondary students, teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2188)|
| 0:36:30| Why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2190)|
| 0:36:31| Why do we want to transform the high school experience for students?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2191)|
| 0:36:35| And we also create what we call a profile of a graduate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2195)|
| 0:36:38| This is the fun part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2198)|
| 0:36:40| We love this part, creating a profile of a graduate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2200)|
| 0:36:42| because what do all the stakeholders want?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2202)|
| 0:36:45| All the Knox County graduates to know, how do they want them to learn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2205)|
| 0:36:49| How do they want them to think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2209)|
| 0:36:51| What types of experiences do you want them to have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2211)|
| 0:36:54| And that really becomes your guiding North Star for everything going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2214)|
| 0:36:59| So you want to say that every student that walks across that stage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2219)|
| 0:37:03| has these attributes that the community and the school district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2223)|
| 0:37:06| collectively together have defined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2226)|
| 0:37:09| It's also about shared accountability then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2229)|
| 0:37:11| because everybody has a responsibility to that profile of a graduate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2231)|
| 0:37:14| It doesn't matter what role or responsibility you assume in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2234)|
| 0:37:17| That's what you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2237)|
| 0:37:19| That's what you're helping to have the students be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2239)|
| 0:37:21| is that profile of a graduate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2241)|
| 0:37:25| This also helps define a community-wide definition of equity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2245)|
| 0:37:30| because we all work off a different definition of equity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2250)|
| 0:37:33| But developing what does that mean for the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2253)|
| 0:37:35| is going to be very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2255)|
| 0:37:37| At this juncture, we also establish what's called a steering committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2257)|
| 0:37:40| which kind of oversees the transformation work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2260)|
| 0:37:43| And this is a group of school members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2263)|
| 0:37:47| the school community and external community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2267)|
| 0:37:51| of really your advocates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2271)|
| 0:37:54| people in high-level positions that will serve on the steering committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2274)|
| 0:37:59| So as an example, we've already told Mr. Thomas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2279)|
| 0:38:02| that Superintendent Thomas would have a seat on that steering committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2282)|
| 0:38:06| We would have a board member to have seats on that steering committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2286)|
| 0:38:09| Some of your CEOs from your major corporations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2289)|
| 0:38:12| would have a seat on that steering committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2292)|
| 0:38:14| Somebody at a high level in your post-secondary institutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2294)|
| 0:38:17| would have a seat on that steering committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2297)|
| 0:38:19| So they're really monitoring this transformation and what happens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2299)|
| 0:38:23| and looking at different data points and assisting, advising, and advocate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2303)|
| 0:38:27| They're your biggest advocates out there in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2307)|
| 0:38:30| So once we get through phase two, then we move into phase three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2310)|
| 0:38:33| which is that developing the master plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2313)|
| 0:38:35| And this is really your action plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2315)|
| 0:38:38| This is how you're going to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2318)|
| 0:38:40| How are you going to achieve your goals and your outcomes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2320)|
| 0:38:44| So it's a living document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2324)|
| 0:38:46| It's a working document with everybody's input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2326)|
| 0:38:48| that really establishes, again, those roles and responsibilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2328)|
| 0:38:51| for everyone to achieve the goals that you've defined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2331)|
| 0:38:55| And there's measurable outcomes in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2335)|
| 0:38:57| So it holds all stakeholders accountable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2337)|
| 0:39:00| not just the school district, not just the business community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2340)|
| 0:39:03| but everyone is held accountable to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2343)|
| 0:39:08| So next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2348)|
| 0:39:09| So what's our timeline for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2349)|
| 0:39:11| Well, we're quickly, as Superintendent Thomas said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2351)|
| 0:39:14| moving into the August time frame and the start-up of school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2354)|
| 0:39:17| So we'll start those initial planning meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2357)|
| 0:39:19| with our implementation team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2359)|
| 0:39:21| to really lay out those visioning and master planning sessions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2361)|
| 0:39:25| Our hope is that during September, October,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2365)|
| 0:39:29| we'll have a visioning session, having that one-day session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2369)|
| 0:39:32| and then jumping into our master planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2372)|
| 0:39:34| with the intent of having that completed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2374)|
| 0:39:37| after the first of the year, having that master plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2377)|
| 0:39:40| The reason it's important to have that master plan completed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2380)|
| 0:39:44| by that time frame is to allow the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2384)|
| 0:39:47| for those first-year implementation strategies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2387)|
| 0:39:50| to be put into place for the fall of 22-23,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2390)|
| 0:39:54| because this will be scaffolded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2394)|
| 0:39:56| The master plan will be scaffolded year one, two, three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2396)|
| 0:39:59| but we want to start to work on that implementation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2399)|
| 0:40:02| the heavy lifting, going into the fall of the 2022 school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2402)|
| 0:40:06| So that allows that time for that to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2406)|
| 0:40:10| Also, I wanted to tell you, I forgot the fun part of this too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2410)|
| 0:40:13| is that we'll have a designation ceremony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2413)|
| 0:40:15| After you complete your master plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2415)|
| 0:40:17| we're going to celebrate your achievement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2417)|
| 0:40:19| And at that time, you are officially designated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2419)|
| 0:40:21| as a Ford Next Generation Learning Community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2421)|
| 0:40:24| and you will join those 43-plus communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2424)|
| 0:40:26| as one of those that have chosen to take a bold step forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2426)|
| 0:40:30| to be creative and innovative for all of your students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2430)|
| 0:40:34| So, Keith, go ahead and talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2434)|
| 0:40:40| If you'll put the next slide up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2440)|
| 0:40:42| So, I have a very small role to play in this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2442)|
| 0:40:45| and that is in relation to this slide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2445)|
| 0:40:47| because Donna and Jane actually chose to include this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2447)|
| 0:40:50| This was a slide that we created for our very first meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2450)|
| 0:40:53| with principals prior to our focus groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2453)|
| 0:40:56| Sorry, get closer to the mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2456)|
| 0:40:57| Prior to setting off the work with the focus groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2457)|
| 0:40:59| this was a slide that we shared with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2459)|
| 0:41:01| And as she mentioned, part of that next phase of the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2461)|
| 0:41:04| is really to develop a community-wide sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2464)|
| 0:41:06| for why the need for transformation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2466)|
| 0:41:08| and why the need to make some changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2468)|
| 0:41:10| And that really is a process that you go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2470)|
| 0:41:13| to really define that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2473)|
| 0:41:15| But we started our principals with this idea of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2475)|
| 0:41:17| well, why do we need to engage with Ford?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2477)|
| 0:41:19| Why do we want to be using them to start these conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2479)|
| 0:41:22| and to do this work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2482)|
| 0:41:24| And I'm encouraged, I think, as you look at the report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2484)|
| 0:41:27| and I'll kind of briefly go through these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2487)|
| 0:41:29| I think that we've got some direction and some answers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2489)|
| 0:41:32| and some confirmation that this was the kind of thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2492)|
| 0:41:35| that we needed to be seeking assistance on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2495)|
| 0:41:38| And so the points we really talked to our principals about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2498)|
| 0:41:40| is this idea that access to post-secondary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2500)|
| 0:41:43| is not enough for our students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2503)|
| 0:41:45| that we really have to be thinking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2505)|
| 0:41:47| not only are they getting in, but why are they going there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2507)|
| 0:41:50| What's their purpose?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2510)|
| 0:41:51| How have they prepared themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2511)|
| 0:41:53| for arriving at the community college level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2513)|
| 0:41:55| or the university level?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2515)|
| 0:41:57| Like, what have they done during their high school experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2517)|
| 0:41:59| that's refined their reason for being there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2519)|
| 0:42:02| And then also this idea that there's a difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2522)|
| 0:42:04| between being prepared to graduate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2524)|
| 0:42:06| to walk across that stage with the right number of credits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2526)|
| 0:42:09| and all of those things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2529)|
| 0:42:10| and being prepared to be successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2530)|
| 0:42:12| So that once I arrive at that post-secondary level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2532)|
| 0:42:15| for continued education, for training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2535)|
| 0:42:17| or maybe straight to the workplace,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2537)|
| 0:42:19| what have those experiences that I've had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2539)|
| 0:42:21| while I've been in high school done for me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2541)|
| 0:42:23| that ensure that I'm going to be as successful as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2543)|
| 0:42:25| with whatever my next step is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2545)|
| 0:42:27| The third one, and very relevant in terms of CTE,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2547)|
| 0:42:30| because we hear that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2550)|
| 0:42:31| I know you guys from your seats hear that a lot too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2551)|
| 0:42:34| from business partners and folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2554)|
| 0:42:36| You know, there's a large degree of interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2556)|
| 0:42:38| and good intention about working with our students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2558)|
| 0:42:41| and engaging with our students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2561)|
| 0:42:42| and really the need to build the talent pipeline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2562)|
| 0:42:45| for the business community here in the Knoxville area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2565)|
| 0:42:49| And we know that the high schools play an integral role in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2569)|
| 0:42:52| But again, with 16 high schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2572)|
| 0:42:54| and a variety of programs and teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2574)|
| 0:42:57| and just ways of businesses engaging with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2577)|
| 0:43:00| we've got to have a better framework and structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2580)|
| 0:43:02| for how we do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2582)|
| 0:43:03| if we're going to be contributing to that talent pipeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2583)|
| 0:43:07| So that's everything from those partnerships| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2587)|
| 0:43:10| to what types of experiences and credentials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2590)|
| 0:43:12| and early post-secondary opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2592)|
| 0:43:14| students are engaged with while they're in high school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2594)|
| 0:43:16| and thinking very intentionally about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2596)|
| 0:43:18| And then last, and I think this is the one that sort of rings true| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2598)|
| 0:43:21| when you think about some of the challenges we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2601)|
| 0:43:24| is that it's not enough to have some of our students succeed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2604)|
| 0:43:27| We think about those first-generation college goers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2607)|
| 0:43:30| We think about, you know, I think of my own children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2610)|
| 0:43:34| who benefit from the fact that I've been in school and college| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2614)|
| 0:43:37| and I've navigated that and I can help them do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2617)|
| 0:43:40| And so they get a lot of that assistance from me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2620)|
| 0:43:42| And we have students that get that at school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2622)|
| 0:43:44| We have students that get that from their parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2624)|
| 0:43:46| And then we have some that maybe don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2626)|
| 0:43:47| And so this idea of what you hear from Jane and Donna| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2627)|
| 0:43:51| talk a lot about systematic approaches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2631)|
| 0:43:53| and increasing our consistency, increasing our intentionality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2633)|
| 0:43:56| That's the idea and the spirit there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2636)|
| 0:43:58| is we can't have kids that fall through the cracks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2638)|
| 0:44:00| and don't get those experiences that we know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2640)|
| 0:44:03| are going to be crucial to their next steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2643)|
| 0:44:05| And we can't rely on it just being the role of the family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2645)|
| 0:44:08| or the student to self-advocate to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2648)|
| 0:44:10| We have to be intentional about what that looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2650)|
| 0:44:12| And so that was sort of, again, the spirit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2652)|
| 0:44:14| of how we started this conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2654)|
| 0:44:16| with our school principals in leading into the focus group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2656)|
| 0:44:19| And I hope that you can see the beginnings of this work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2659)|
| 0:44:23| from the feedback that we're seeing from this report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2663)|
| 0:44:25| And so I think I'm turning it back to Jane and Donna| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2665)|
| 0:44:28| for questions at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2668)|
| 0:44:29| I think that's the end of the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2669)|
| 0:44:32| Thanks, Keith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2672)|
| 0:44:33| Yeah, we're willing to take any questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2673)|
| 0:44:35| that you might have for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2675)|
| 0:44:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2676)|
| 0:44:37| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2677)|
| 0:44:38| Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2678)|
| 0:44:39| I'll start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2679)|
| 0:44:40| First off, and I think a lot of people know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2680)|
| 0:44:42| but I got to go to Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2682)|
| 0:44:44| And it almost, I had forgotten about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2684)|
| 0:44:46| because it was the week before kind of the world| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2686)|
| 0:44:48| died with COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2688)|
| 0:44:49| But it was a great experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2689)|
| 0:44:51| And I got to go with Keith Wilson and Amy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2691)|
| 0:44:53| Nolan from the chamber and some other people with CTE.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2693)|
| 0:44:55| And I'll just say the thing that really struck me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2695)|
| 0:44:59| that I know we are not doing in our schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2699)|
| 0:45:01| is we do not have the partnerships with industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2701)|
| 0:45:04| And when I went to those schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2704)|
| 0:45:06| and they had a day and program set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2706)|
| 0:45:08| But I mean, these were some top employers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2708)|
| 0:45:10| Like their CEOs and stuff like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2710)|
| 0:45:12| were engaged in the schools in Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2712)|
| 0:45:15| not like at the central office level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2715)|
| 0:45:20| but like they had a relationship with Powell or Halls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2720)|
| 0:45:23| or wherever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2723)|
| 0:45:24| And they were meeting with teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2724)|
| 0:45:26| They were meeting with programming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2726)|
| 0:45:28| to make sure that we really are developing our students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2728)|
| 0:45:31| and offering things like internships and things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2731)|
| 0:45:33| like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2733)|
| 0:45:34| And I think that we all want to do that and want more of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2734)|
| 0:45:38| But I think what I like about what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2738)|
| 0:45:40| Ford Next Generation is offering is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2740)|
| 0:45:42| it does give us a framework for doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2742)|
| 0:45:44| Because I think our schools too much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2744)|
| 0:45:46| are going off in too many different directions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2746)|
| 0:45:49| And some of them are doing some good things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2749)|
| 0:45:51| But we definitely are not doing it consistently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2751)|
| 0:45:53| off the district and across the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2753)|
| 0:45:55| And that's one thing I really am hoping to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2755)|
| 0:45:59| Like Keith talked about and you all talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2759)|
| 0:46:01| is really being able to provide this to all of our children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2761)|
| 0:46:04| and giving them good pathways to be successful after school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2764)|
| 0:46:07| So I do have one question for you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2767)|
| 0:46:09| As we're talking about trying to get this implementation started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2769)|
| 0:46:13| in fall 22-23, the way you all do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2773)|
| 0:46:17| would we start with all of our high schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2777)|
| 0:46:19| Or do you start piecemeal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2779)|
| 0:46:21| How does that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2781)|
| 0:46:23| That's really different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2783)|
| 0:46:25| That varies by district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2785)|
| 0:46:26| So that's going to be a decision that you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2786)|
| 0:46:28| going to have to make moving forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2788)|
| 0:46:30| is it going to be an original cohort of schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2790)|
| 0:46:32| and which schools that will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2792)|
| 0:46:34| So, again, that's something that will be a decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2794)|
| 0:46:36| that will be coming forth, I would say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2796)|
| 0:46:39| probably in the next few months, John, would you say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2799)|
| 0:46:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2801)|
| 0:46:43| And we'll help you walk through that process of making,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2803)|
| 0:46:45| you know, how are you going to make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2805)|
| 0:46:47| we call them implementation decisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2807)|
| 0:46:49| and that's one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2809)|
| 0:46:51| I appreciate the work you all are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2811)|
| 0:46:53| I mean, I think it's very, I think it's exciting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2813)|
| 0:46:55| to hear what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2815)|
| 0:46:57| Okay, good, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2817)|
| 0:46:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2818)|
| 0:46:59| Sorry, can I add one thing to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2819)|
| 0:47:00| Thank you for that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2820)|
| 0:47:02| No, go ahead, Dr. Eisen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2822)|
| 0:47:03| Since we're answering questions, I will say this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2823)|
| 0:47:05| that we have at least, I'm looking at Danny and Keith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2825)|
| 0:47:08| at least four to five schools, five, thank you, Danny,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2828)|
| 0:47:11| that have been involved either going to the trips| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2831)|
| 0:47:13| and or in like some small groups working through that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2833)|
| 0:47:16| and I won't name those schools right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2836)|
| 0:47:18| So it's like this, there are some principals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2838)|
| 0:47:21| that haven't been any more involved in hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2841)|
| 0:47:23| the presentation and hearing their colleagues talk about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2843)|
| 0:47:25| but there are five that have been pretty engaged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2845)|
| 0:47:27| in the work to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2847)|
| 0:47:29| So we feel like if we do go a cohort model,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2849)|
| 0:47:32| that we will have some early pioneers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2852)|
| 0:47:34| who will want to start that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2854)|
| 0:47:36| And I mean, has this kind of what we've learned today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2856)|
| 0:47:39| has that been presented to all of our high school principals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2859)|
| 0:47:42| at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2862)|
| 0:47:43| I don't think we've done the full presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2863)|
| 0:47:45| No, we haven't talked through each of the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2865)|
| 0:47:47| but again, they got feedback on their focus groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2867)|
| 0:47:50| They helped actually set those up for their parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2870)|
| 0:47:53| and their teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2873)|
| 0:47:54| So again, it's not foreign to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2874)|
| 0:47:55| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2875)|
| 0:47:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2877)|
| 0:47:58| And I'll just say thank you to Knox Education Foundation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2878)|
| 0:48:01| for really being such a partner in starting this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2881)|
| 0:48:05| in helping Dr. Reiswick and his team in this conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2885)|
| 0:48:09| and really helping get it off the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2889)|
| 0:48:11| So thank you for that commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2891)|
| 0:48:13| And Dr. Reiswick, would you like to talk about just the vision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2893)|
| 0:48:17| for the next steps for Phase 2, 3, 4, 5?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2897)|
| 0:48:24| As far as just to add any kind of time table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2904)|
| 0:48:29| or whatever you want to add to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2909)|
| 0:48:31| Thank you, Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2911)|
| 0:48:32| I think, again, I think there's sometimes you realize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2912)|
| 0:48:36| you have an expertise in an area and there's sometimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2916)|
| 0:48:38| you realize you need to go partner with experts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2918)|
| 0:48:40| who understand all of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2920)|
| 0:48:42| And I think, again, like seeing Amy in the crowd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2922)|
| 0:48:46| and Keith and Danny, I mean, these are conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2926)|
| 0:48:48| we were having three years ago about how do we do this wisely?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2928)|
| 0:48:52| How do we not just charge into something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2932)|
| 0:48:54| and pull something off a website and do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2934)|
| 0:48:56| So through lots of conversations, and I'll say lots of frustrations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2936)|
| 0:49:00| because lots of times when we've tried to get off the ground,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2940)|
| 0:49:03| we've had conversations with the mayor today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2943)|
| 0:49:05| There's times we've stepped on his toes and he's stepped on ours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2945)|
| 0:49:07| trying to figure some of this stuff out, and we know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2947)|
| 0:49:09| So I think we realize this is something we could do on our own,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2949)|
| 0:49:13| and I think spending that time to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2953)|
| 0:49:15| So I say all that to say I know there will be pieces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2955)|
| 0:49:18| they'll challenge us in and there will be tough questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2958)|
| 0:49:21| and courageous decisions we'll have to make, as Jane said earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2961)|
| 0:49:25| But I think it does, making this master plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2965)|
| 0:49:29| defining what we as a community expect in our profile of a graduate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2969)|
| 0:49:33| what is a graduate, no matter if you go to school at Carter or Farragut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2973)|
| 0:49:36| what do we expect all kids to have exposure to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2976)|
| 0:49:38| not just their senior year, but back in the sixth grade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2978)|
| 0:49:41| that builds to that level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2981)|
| 0:49:43| Again, this has been in our heads for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2983)|
| 0:49:45| We visited Catholic, we visited Web, we saw what they do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2985)|
| 0:49:48| for their freshmen, sophomores, juniors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2988)|
| 0:49:50| and we don't have that kind of uniform system in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2990)|
| 0:49:53| And we're a larger system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2993)|
| 0:49:54| That's hard to get that kind of cohesion around that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2994)|
| 0:49:57| So I think all of those kinds of things we'll start seeing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2997)|
| 0:49:59| small steps working that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=2999)|
| 0:50:01| But again, as Donna and Jane have said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3001)|
| 0:50:04| everyone has to understand the why first that we're going there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3004)|
| 0:50:07| It's not a compliance thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3007)|
| 0:50:08| It's not the state's making us do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3008)|
| 0:50:10| It's understanding what we want to do to drive forward for kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3010)|
| 0:50:14| and once we have that common definition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3014)|
| 0:50:16| backward planning, what that looks like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3016)|
| 0:50:18| and what structures and systems need to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3018)|
| 0:50:20| Because there will be decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3020)|
| 0:50:21| And again, it's not a, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3021)|
| 0:50:23| we're going to gut a school and change all its programming out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3023)|
| 0:50:25| But, I mean, they need to have a plan toward intentionality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3025)|
| 0:50:28| around programs they offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3028)|
| 0:50:30| And, you know, maybe when someone retires,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3030)|
| 0:50:32| that's a time to think about what do we do with the program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3032)|
| 0:50:34| and those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3034)|
| 0:50:35| So I think there will be good decisions made around that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3035)|
| 0:50:39| And, again, we're confident with the success they've had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3039)|
| 0:50:42| in other communities that they'll help us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3042)|
| 0:50:44| And we'll learn from the other communities, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3044)|
| 0:50:46| and we're excited to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3046)|
| 0:50:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3047)|
| 0:50:48| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3048)|
| 0:50:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3049)|
| 0:50:50| Other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3050)|
| 0:50:52| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3052)|
| 0:50:54| Thank you, Susan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3054)|
| 0:50:55| So I'm thrilled with the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3055)|
| 0:50:57| and really appreciate the intentionality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3057)|
| 0:51:00| around engaging the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3060)|
| 0:51:02| the level of work that went on there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3062)|
| 0:51:04| that this isn't a top-down approach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3064)|
| 0:51:07| but it's really hearing from the community system-wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3067)|
| 0:51:09| And I think one of the critical things moving forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3069)|
| 0:51:12| will be defining that community-wide definition of equity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3072)|
| 0:51:15| Like you said, people tend to define that very differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3075)|
| 0:51:18| And I think that will be a challenge, but a good one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3078)|
| 0:51:21| to take the community through that process in doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3081)|
| 0:51:24| I have just a couple questions about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3084)|
| 0:51:28| One is I know you started talking about the freshman academy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3088)|
| 0:51:34| and getting that started and the impact on high schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3094)|
| 0:51:37| What potential direct or indirect impacts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3097)|
| 0:51:40| have you seen in other communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3100)|
| 0:51:42| for your middle school students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3102)|
| 0:51:44| and grades even below that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3104)|
| 0:51:46| I mean, I know this is directed toward high school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3106)|
| 0:51:48| and what we're doing there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3108)|
| 0:51:50| but what are the potential impacts that you're seeing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3110)|
| 0:51:52| in that strategy and systems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3112)|
| 0:51:54| even before the high school years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3114)|
| 0:51:57| That's a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3117)|
| 0:51:59| Interesting enough, right now we are working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3119)|
| 0:52:01| with Akron School District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3121)|
| 0:52:03| which is one of our communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3123)|
| 0:52:05| that is taking this model now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3125)|
| 0:52:07| and putting it down into the middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3127)|
| 0:52:09| and doing a strategic plan for their elementary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3129)|
| 0:52:11| so that there are profiles of an 8th grader| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3131)|
| 0:52:14| and profiles so each one kind of locks together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3134)|
| 0:52:18| The other thing that's really important, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3138)|
| 0:52:21| is middle school strategies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3141)|
| 0:52:23| for career development and career advising| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3143)|
| 0:52:25| that really needs to go down into the elementary level, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3145)|
| 0:52:28| so that students are coming through all the grades,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3148)|
| 0:52:31| understanding that career development, career advising,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3151)|
| 0:52:34| and where that can lead them to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3154)|
| 0:52:36| so that by the time they get to that 9th grade level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3156)|
| 0:52:38| they have a lot of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3158)|
| 0:52:40| Right now, like, you just kind of get dropped off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3160)|
| 0:52:43| into that 9th grade year, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3163)|
| 0:52:45| And it's like, oh, I've got to make all these decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3165)|
| 0:52:47| So it really is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3167)|
| 0:52:49| And some communities have even written| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3169)|
| 0:52:51| into their master plan a middle school strategy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3171)|
| 0:52:55| so that they make sure that that is happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3175)|
| 0:52:58| for all the middle school students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3178)|
| 0:53:00| So are those the types of questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3180)|
| 0:53:02| that are standard within this core next-generation process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3182)|
| 0:53:06| where you're asking districts to also consider that pipeline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3186)|
| 0:53:11| and how that system is developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3191)|
| 0:53:13| even in advance of the high schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3193)|
| 0:53:15| I mean, I know you're saying some communities have done that work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3195)|
| 0:53:18| but are those the types of questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3198)|
| 0:53:20| that all communities are asking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3200)|
| 0:53:22| Now, the results may be different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3202)|
| 0:53:24| We're getting a lot more questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3204)|
| 0:53:26| about that middle school piece right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3206)|
| 0:53:28| because they're seeing the value at the high school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3208)|
| 0:53:30| but then they start thinking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3210)|
| 0:53:32| well, we need to start preparing our kids earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3212)|
| 0:53:34| We're seeing more of our work coming down into the middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3214)|
| 0:53:37| and the elementary levels, definitely, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3217)|
| 0:53:40| So as the work moves into the next phase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3220)|
| 0:53:42| how can the board be most supportive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3222)|
| 0:53:46| I think just...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3226)|
| 0:53:48| I was going to add on the middle school portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3228)|
| 0:53:50| I have also seen communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3230)|
| 0:53:52| with sort of a STEAM focus in the middle schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3232)|
| 0:53:55| because if you look at science, technology, engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3235)|
| 0:53:58| arts and mathematics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3238)|
| 0:54:00| that's going to feed into almost any career pathway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3240)|
| 0:54:02| So really having those STEAM conversations in the middle school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3242)|
| 0:54:06| But I do think the more our communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3246)|
| 0:54:08| are seeing the engagement at the high school level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3248)|
| 0:54:11| as Jane said, they're pushing down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3251)|
| 0:54:13| And so those conversations come up during that master planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3253)|
| 0:54:16| because during master plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3256)|
| 0:54:18| there are tactical plans that the community will complete,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3258)|
| 0:54:23| and one will be about a continuum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3263)|
| 0:54:27| If that's work-based learning, do you want to start earlier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3267)|
| 0:54:32| But then I think you had a question about...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3272)|
| 0:54:34| What was your last question, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3274)|
| 0:54:36| Well, my last question was how can the board be most supportive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3276)|
| 0:54:39| as we move into this next phase of the process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3279)|
| 0:54:41| You know, I think just being a part of our conversations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3281)|
| 0:54:45| having a seat at the table and being able to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3285)|
| 0:54:49| and just be supportive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3289)|
| 0:54:51| to understand that this is for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3291)|
| 0:54:54| And when we say all, it is truly capital A, capital L, capital L.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3294)|
| 0:54:59| And creating system structures and processes for all students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3299)|
| 0:55:02| And so I think being at those visioning sessions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3302)|
| 0:55:06| helping us envision what does that mean for you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3306)|
| 0:55:09| because you represent all of the families in each of your districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3309)|
| 0:55:13| and then continuing to ask questions to push us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3313)|
| 0:55:17| and to push this steering committee and group as we move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3317)|
| 0:55:21| So it's great having an organization like your all's at the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3321)|
| 0:55:24| that's helped guiding the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3324)|
| 0:55:26| and has all the experience with 43 other partners across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3326)|
| 0:55:30| With those 43 other sites,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3330)|
| 0:55:32| where have you seen districts get it wrong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3332)|
| 0:55:37| in terms of veering off course, getting distracted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3337)|
| 0:55:41| I mean, what are the things we need to be looking out for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3341)|
| 0:55:43| to make sure we're not going down some of those paths?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3343)|
| 0:55:46| For me, I think number one was doing it with fidelity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3346)|
| 0:55:50| just like anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3350)|
| 0:55:54| Once we create system structures and processes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3354)|
| 0:55:57| really doing it with fidelity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3357)|
| 0:56:00| And you'll hear us talk a lot about slow is smooth and smooth is fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3360)|
| 0:56:04| Sometimes we get really excited and we're like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3364)|
| 0:56:06| oh, yes, I want the kids this year to be able to be exposed to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3366)|
| 0:56:11| But it really takes that time to build those structures, processes, and systems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3371)|
| 0:56:15| and change the mindset around how to implement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3375)|
| 0:56:18| and how to use those system structures and processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3378)|
| 0:56:22| So really, for me, it would be fidelity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3382)|
| 0:56:25| and making sure you get the foundation right before you move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3385)|
| 0:56:31| And really the reason for writing the master plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3391)|
| 0:56:33| is the adherence to the master plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3393)|
| 0:56:36| I mean, that's going to be your guide to get to your goals and outcomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3396)|
| 0:56:40| So monitoring that master plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3400)|
| 0:56:42| assuring that what you put in there happens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3402)|
| 0:56:45| so the accountability to that master plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3405)|
| 0:56:47| And it's not just the district accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3407)|
| 0:56:49| It's shared accountability across the community sharing that master plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3409)|
| 0:56:53| I will say that's a living document, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3413)|
| 0:56:55| And there may be times when you start to review that and you say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3415)|
| 0:56:58| oh, we didn't get that done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3418)|
| 0:56:59| Let's move it to the next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3419)|
| 0:57:00| Some things shift or change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3420)|
| 0:57:02| But that master plan is so critically important to keep you on track| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3422)|
| 0:57:07| because there's always distractions, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3427)|
| 0:57:09| The next shiny penny is going to come along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3429)|
| 0:57:12| But you have to be committed to the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3432)|
| 0:57:15| And we always say trust the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3435)|
| 0:57:18| and be committed to that process to get you to your goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3438)|
| 0:57:23| Because it's going to get a little sluggish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3443)|
| 0:57:25| It's going to get a little slow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3445)|
| 0:57:26| As Donna said, all of a sudden the business partners are going to want to come,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3446)|
| 0:57:29| yeah, yeah, yeah, I want to do this, I want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3449)|
| 0:57:31| You have to scaffold it, slow it down so that you're taking each step,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3451)|
| 0:57:35| getting it right, and then going to the next step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3455)|
| 0:57:38| Get it right and move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3458)|
| 0:57:40| And I would also like to add when you develop these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3460)|
| 0:57:44| if you call these the Academies of Knox County or the Academies of Knox,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3464)|
| 0:57:49| I doubt seriously you're going to name them the Academies of Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3469)|
| 0:57:54| They are going to be the Academies of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3474)|
| 0:57:57| meaning that this is a complete ownership and accountability across the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3477)|
| 0:58:04| And I think that is so important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3484)|
| 0:58:07| If you can keep that at making sure that it's not just a school district thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3487)|
| 0:58:11| it's not just a community thing, this is our thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3491)|
| 0:58:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3495)|
| 0:58:16| Can I ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3496)|
| 0:58:18| Okay, so I know part of the process will be identifying which,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3498)|
| 0:58:23| what the academies ought to be, what the focus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3503)|
| 0:58:26| what is the need in the community, what those academies should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3506)|
| 0:58:30| So right now, for instance, we have schools that some schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3510)|
| 0:58:34| you know, there may be a welding program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3514)|
| 0:58:36| Some schools there's more of a health career focus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3516)|
| 0:58:39| So would, if a school currently has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3519)|
| 0:58:44| if they're heavy into two different or three different veins of CTE offerings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3524)|
| 0:58:51| would they have, would they, for instance, have two academies that would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3531)|
| 0:58:57| for instance, a health academy and a welding academy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3537)|
| 0:59:01| Does my question make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3541)|
| 0:59:04| And would those be specific to schools so that if a student is interested in one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3544)|
| 0:59:11| of those they may have to transfer to a school for that programming?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3551)|
| 0:59:15| Is that the idea?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3555)|
| 0:59:17| I'm just trying to kind of see how vast the changes would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3557)|
| 0:59:24| And that's a really common question that we get from our communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3564)|
| 0:59:27| It's really not up to Don and I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3567)|
| 0:59:29| This will be up to you and the community to determine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3569)|
| 0:59:32| looking at workforce data, looking at existing programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3572)|
| 0:59:35| I mean, the last thing you want to do is take a really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3575)|
| 0:59:38| really good program and not have it anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3578)|
| 0:59:40| So this isn't about doing away, as John said, with what's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3580)|
| 0:59:43| It's about taking the really good things that are happening and put it together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3583)|
| 0:59:47| I always kind of look at making a quilt, you know, putting all the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3587)|
| 0:59:51| maybe I'm telling my age whenever I talk about quilting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3591)|
| 0:59:53| My grandmother used to quilt, and I used to love her, and I have one of her quilts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3593)|
| 0:59:56| But, you know, putting all those pieces together to make that beautiful quilt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3596)|
| 1:00:02| So right now you have pieces, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3602)|
| 1:00:04| So let's bring them together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3604)|
| 1:00:06| Gotcha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3606)|
| 1:00:07| And what does that look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3607)|
| 1:00:08| But that's going to be a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3608)|
| 1:00:09| That's going to be your decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3609)|
| 1:00:10| And that's why we're not a program or a process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3610)|
| 1:00:13| And I would like to add, just to help you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3613)|
| 1:00:15| I like numbers and being able to see something visually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3615)|
| 1:00:18| An academy is usually made up of anywhere between 350 and 450 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3618)|
| 1:00:25| So probably if you went into a school, let's say a school of 1,500,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3625)|
| 1:00:30| probably your freshman group is probably, I don't know, probably maybe 500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3630)|
| 1:00:35| Just for simplicity's sake, we'll say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3635)|
| 1:00:38| And then if you had 1,000 students grade 10 through 12,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3638)|
| 1:00:41| if you decide that you'll keep freshman academy as a stand-alone academy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3641)|
| 1:00:45| but again, that will be the community's decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3645)|
| 1:00:48| And then if so, then 10 through 12, you had 1,000 students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3648)|
| 1:00:52| I probably recommend that be three academies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3652)|
| 1:00:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3654)|
| 1:00:55| So that becomes families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3655)|
| 1:00:56| Gotcha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3656)|
| 1:00:57| That is exactly what I was wondering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3657)|
| 1:01:00| I think that answers my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3660)|
| 1:01:02| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3662)|
| 1:01:03| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3663)|
| 1:01:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3664)|
| 1:01:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3665)|
| 1:01:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3666)|
| 1:01:07| Other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3667)|
| 1:01:08| Dr. Resnick, did you want to add something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3668)|
| 1:01:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3669)|
| 1:01:10| I was just going to say, you know, I've heard Keith say this before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3670)|
| 1:01:12| and I think it's right, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3672)|
| 1:01:13| And we talked about this some today in some of our meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3673)|
| 1:01:16| So there will be multiple exits for students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3676)|
| 1:01:20| There will be some students who will exit as they graduate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3680)|
| 1:01:22| and go straight to workforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3682)|
| 1:01:23| And we're good with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3683)|
| 1:01:24| There will be some who will get PhDs and then go to workforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3684)|
| 1:01:27| So I think what – and Keith's always great to remind us of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3687)|
| 1:01:31| We're not saying that every kid is going to be locked into their profession| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3691)|
| 1:01:34| when they graduate high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3694)|
| 1:01:36| So for some kids, yes, and they'll be able to utilize that to a certain –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3696)|
| 1:01:39| so some kid may want to do a programmatic transfer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3699)|
| 1:01:42| and we offer that now in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3702)|
| 1:01:44| But most kids, it's really the value of what we can do through –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3704)|
| 1:01:50| CTE is a very experiential type of learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3710)|
| 1:01:52| It's very different than, you know, reading a novel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3712)|
| 1:01:54| or doing something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3714)|
| 1:01:55| So we think there's value even in having exposure to that kind of learning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3715)|
| 1:02:00| within your high school experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3720)|
| 1:02:02| And then the other thing we've realized, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3722)|
| 1:02:03| is sometimes kids realize that's not what they want to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3723)|
| 1:02:05| and that's just as valuable before you leave high school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3725)|
| 1:02:08| than to know what you do want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3728)|
| 1:02:09| So I don't know that we're going to see, like, a mass exit of transfers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3729)|
| 1:02:13| where people not want to play for their football team and their band| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3733)|
| 1:02:15| and those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3735)|
| 1:02:16| But we have that currently in place where someone could change for a program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3736)|
| 1:02:20| So, again, it will play out as it does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3740)|
| 1:02:22| but I don't see that happening in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3742)|
| 1:02:25| Okay. That makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3745)|
| 1:02:26| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3746)|
| 1:02:28| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3748)|
| 1:02:31| John may have partially answered part of my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3751)|
| 1:02:36| It was along the lines of the things you were talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3756)|
| 1:02:41| As Mr. Watson was talking over there about the definition of equity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3761)|
| 1:02:46| it will be interesting to find out how that shakes out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3766)|
| 1:02:53| But in reference to what you were talking about, John,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3773)|
| 1:03:01| in the process, do you all encourage the kids to, as many of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3781)|
| 1:03:10| to go to college as can?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3790)|
| 1:03:14| Is that part of the process and the goal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3794)|
| 1:03:19| Or is it more that they seek the level that they, you know, where they want to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3799)|
| 1:03:29| I think John said something that is probably more important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3809)|
| 1:03:34| than a lot of us have ever thought about or realized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3814)|
| 1:03:38| But you may not know exactly what you want to do when you graduate from high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3818)|
| 1:03:45| Most of us didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3825)|
| 1:03:47| For sure, we had some idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3827)|
| 1:03:50| But if you can find out something that you definitely don't want to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3830)|
| 1:03:57| that helps you tremendously, or I would think it would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3837)|
| 1:04:03| Yeah, and remember, if students can discover these things in high school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3843)|
| 1:04:07| just think what it saves in the long run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3847)|
| 1:04:11| You know, they're basically learning what they want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3851)|
| 1:04:15| or maybe what they don't want in a public school setting, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3855)|
| 1:04:19| So when they do make those decisions, then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3859)|
| 1:04:21| I had a professor tell me one time that kids graduate from college,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3861)|
| 1:04:25| it's like having a mortgage without a house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3865)|
| 1:04:28| because they've gone through college, but they still don't know what they do, want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3868)|
| 1:04:32| So having those experiences, and when you have that profile of a graduate, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3872)|
| 1:04:37| remember, an academy may not be specific, you know, to a student,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3877)|
| 1:04:41| but they're still going to have all those skills, experiences that all students will have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3881)|
| 1:04:47| So there's great value in any type of learning in an academy that students achieve through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3887)|
| 1:04:53| just because they get those 21st century learning skills and communications and problem solving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3893)|
| 1:04:57| and teamwork and everything that's essential for moving on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3897)|
| 1:05:01| The quicker that they can, in my opinion, the quicker they can establish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3901)|
| 1:05:07| what they don't want to do and what they want to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3907)|
| 1:05:12| and pursue that to whatever level they're comfortable with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3912)|
| 1:05:18| the quicker they can get into that career, the more earning power that they will have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3918)|
| 1:05:24| more years of earning power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3924)|
| 1:05:27| Absolutely. Just quickly, I'll tell you why I'm so passionate about this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3927)|
| 1:05:31| In high school, I was told I had to go to college.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3931)|
| 1:05:34| I went to college, but I had no idea why I was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3934)|
| 1:05:37| I quit after three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3937)|
| 1:05:39| Spent three years with no idea. I went to work for ten years in a warehouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3939)|
| 1:05:43| I packed orders and, you know, unloaded trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3943)|
| 1:05:47| After ten years, somebody said to me, do you really want to do this the rest of your life?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3947)|
| 1:05:50| Well, I said no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3950)|
| 1:05:52| So I went back to college after ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3952)|
| 1:05:54| And it was hard then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3954)|
| 1:05:56| Had a, you know, was married, had responsibilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3956)|
| 1:05:59| So I went back, completed my undergraduate degree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3959)|
| 1:06:02| and eventually went on for my graduate degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3962)|
| 1:06:05| But I think, what if I would have had this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3965)|
| 1:06:08| And I think, how many kids are me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3968)|
| 1:06:10| And I don't want kids to be me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3970)|
| 1:06:13| Because it was hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3973)|
| 1:06:15| So what you're saying is absolutely right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3975)|
| 1:06:17| Totally concur with you on that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3977)|
| 1:06:19| The sooner kids can think about what they don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3979)|
| 1:06:22| But they're also learning those thinking skills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3982)|
| 1:06:25| that are going to help them no matter where they go or what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3985)|
| 1:06:28| They're prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3988)|
| 1:06:29| We say college, career, and life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3989)|
| 1:06:31| And that life to me is probably, should be life on the front end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3991)|
| 1:06:35| You know, versus the college and career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3995)|
| 1:06:38| So, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3998)|
| 1:06:39| So other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=3999)|
| 1:06:40| I wanted to just address the career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=4000)|
| 1:06:42| You asked, would we encourage two-year trade school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=4002)|
| 1:06:46| What we really encourage is post-secondary training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=4006)|
| 1:06:50| And many communities are taking the word college| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=4010)|
| 1:06:55| and trying to help students understand that that could mean university,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=4015)|
| 1:06:58| but it could mean community college.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=4018)|
| 1:07:00| It might mean trade school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=4020)|
| 1:07:01| It could be an apprenticeship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=4021)|
| 1:07:03| But that every pathway has multiple exit points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=4023)|
| 1:07:07| Because some students may want to go directly to UT Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=4027)|
| 1:07:10| right out of high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=4030)|
| 1:07:12| But some students may need to get an industry certification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=4032)|
| 1:07:15| and work their way through the Pellissippi to get to that same point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=4035)|
| 1:07:19| And so I think it's really making sure that we build the pipelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=4039)|
| 1:07:24| the infrastructure for students and families to see multiple exit points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=4044)|
| 1:07:29| and that they're all successful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=4049)|
| 1:07:31| that we're not just saying only a four-year degree equals success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=4051)|
| 1:07:37| Other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=4057)|
| 1:07:38| John said we had 30 minutes, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=4058)|
| 1:07:40| We've gone well beyond our 30 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=4060)|
| 1:07:43| But other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=4063)|
| 1:07:44| We're willing to sustain and entertain questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=4064)|
| 1:07:47| Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=4067)|
| 1:07:49| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=4069)|
| 1:07:51| One quick question, John,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=4071)|
| 1:07:53| you were referencing a little bit about transfers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=4073)|
| 1:07:56| And we have a transfer process now in Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=4076)|
| 1:08:00| I wouldn't say it's incredibly open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=4080)|
| 1:08:02| So as you've seen communities adopt more of this academy structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=4082)|
| 1:08:08| and as communities have worked toward equity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=4088)|
| 1:08:11| have you seen communities also start to rethink the way they look at choice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=4091)|
| 1:08:15| within their system and the ability for students to move outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=4095)|
| 1:08:19| or to go to schools outside of their zones and rethinking those processes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=4099)|
| 1:08:25| We have certainly seen, and I can only speak for Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=4105)|
| 1:08:30| and we do not offer the same academies at each school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=4110)|
| 1:08:34| So we have specialties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=4114)|
| 1:08:35| I will say that of our 12 academy schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=4115)|
| 1:08:38| health science, for example, is the highest need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=4118)|
| 1:08:41| and the highest interest and aptitude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=4121)|
| 1:08:43| And so we use the U science,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=4123)|
| 1:08:45| and the great thing is many of your schools use that to help indicate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=4125)|
| 1:08:48| where their talents and skills are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=4128)|
| 1:08:50| And so that will play a part too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=4130)|
| 1:08:52| But we've seen some transfer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=4132)|
| 1:08:55| but it really depends on a student's ability to get from one school to the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=4135)|

| 1:09:17| In our communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=4157)|
| 1:09:19| most students seem to stay within their zone school because that's their community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=4159)|

| 1:10:11| Wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210728-quarterly-workshop?start=4211)|
