| 2:59:34| Oh, from the actually house or their property line?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10774)|
| 2:59:37| The actual house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10777)|
| 2:59:38| Oh, well, I mean, I think their lots are 250 feet deep, so they're a couple hundred feet easily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10778)|
| 2:59:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10786)|
| 2:59:47| 300 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10787)|
| 2:59:48| And back from the development of the back of the houses that you will put in to the property line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10788)|
| 2:59:54| how deep do you think that will be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10794)|
| 2:59:56| 70 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10796)|
| 3:00:03| I had Charlie Bussler warming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10803)|
| 3:00:05| He's taking a few practice swings there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10805)|
| 3:00:09| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10809)|
| 3:00:11| A couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10811)|
| 3:00:12| When I came back and mentioned the sector plan that I want to cover back over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10812)|
| 3:00:17| every time you have a sector plan, each part of the county also has a MPC commissioner that represents that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10817)|
| 3:00:25| When we had sector plans, and I hate to sound like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10825)|
| 3:00:28| but back in my time, back in the early 90s, we were given what the sector plan was going to look like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10828)|
| 3:00:36| and I went out to my section that I represented and explained it to the community what it could be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10836)|
| 3:00:43| and they gave ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10843)|
| 3:00:45| Now, if you didn't get that from your commissioner, I'm sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10845)|
| 3:00:51| but the sector plan is where you design and tell how future development's going to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10851)|
| 3:00:58| It seems we're doing it in a backward way in that, okay, all of a sudden we've got a sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10858)|
| 3:01:04| Now we have somebody that wants to do PR, and then we go from, and then MPC, the paid staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10864)|
| 3:01:11| gives us a recommendation, and then their commission gives us a vote on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10871)|
| 3:01:16| saying that it meets within the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10876)|
| 3:01:20| And the person wants to rezone his property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10880)|
| 3:01:26| PR is a very restrictive zone, very restrictive zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10886)|
| 3:01:32| You have to have the plan for the whole property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10892)|
| 3:01:35| You plan part of it and redo it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10895)|
| 3:01:37| You have to have it all at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10897)|
| 3:01:39| Is that not correct, Mr. Green?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10899)|
| 3:01:40| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10900)|
| 3:01:41| You have to have it planned, everything, the roads, everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10901)|
| 3:01:45| Okay, when you go to agricultural, there is no control over what you do on that plan, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10905)|
| 3:01:53| You can do anything on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10913)|
| 3:01:56| If you have a plan and you're going to say, this is what we're going to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10916)|
| 3:02:01| this is the type of houses we're going to do, and if you wanted to, you could say, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10921)|
| 3:02:06| we're going to develop houses from $285,000 to $400,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10926)|
| 3:02:13| I don't know if you can get Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10933)|
| 3:02:15| I don't know if I can get Mr. Smith back there to put that on his plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10935)|
| 3:02:20| but you can almost get it done because I've done it before not too long ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10940)|
| 3:02:25| got a person to tell what they were going to do on the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10945)|
| 3:02:29| So all I'm saying is this issue of how many units per acre for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10949)|
| 3:02:39| should have been addressed by the person that represented that area that was on the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10959)|
| 3:02:46| They didn't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10966)|
| 3:02:48| So it's before us now to say, you know, somebody's asked us if they want to resign at PR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10968)|
| 3:02:55| I think the person that owns the land has a property owner's right to ask for, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10975)|
| 3:03:06| for his land to be protected under PR so his land will be more valuable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10986)|
| 3:03:13| We're not asking the community to rezone ag that you can put a slaughterhouse on or anything like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10993)|
| 3:03:19| I know it's not going to happen out there, but there's so much stuff that you can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10999)|
| 3:03:23| You can put a demolition landfill on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11003)|
| 3:03:26| What's going to protect our property owner now if we decide we're going to put these restrictions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11006)|
| 3:03:35| before he even gets it rezoned, before the plan is even presented to them to vote on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11015)|
| 3:03:42| How are we going to address this in the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11022)|
| 3:03:45| I mean, we're really restricting property owners, and I don't know if we have the legal right to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11025)|
| 3:03:52| We can say, okay, here's a sector plan, and here's what the zoning is you can do in that sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11032)|
| 3:03:59| We either do it or we don't, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11039)|
| 3:04:01| And then you have the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11041)|
| 3:04:03| It's already been recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11043)|
| 3:04:05| I went out there and looked at the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11045)|
| 3:04:07| My goodness, you could get the way the land is just beautiful out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11047)|
| 3:04:13| Eight, nine units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11053)|
| 3:04:15| But you don't want it, you know, if I was on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11055)|
| 3:04:19| But he's gone down to here, and he's putting himself on the line, and we're trying to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11059)|
| 3:04:30| No, you can't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11070)|
| 3:04:31| You can't do your property that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11071)|
| 3:04:34| And, again, I don't know if we have the right to do that to that property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11074)|
| 3:04:41| I mean, really, property owners have a right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11081)|
| 3:04:44| I moved in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11084)|
| 3:04:45| Well, never mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11085)|
| 3:04:47| I'm going to shut up now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11087)|
| 3:04:48| But, anyway, like I said, I just want to let you know, sector plan is where we do it at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11088)|
| 3:04:54| And then from that point on, it's up to the property owner to ask because it fits within his property rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11094)|
| 3:05:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11100)|
| 3:05:01| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11101)|
| 3:05:03| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11103)|
| 3:05:04| If you'll just indulge me for one minute here or two, I feel like I've, for the last 20 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11104)|
| 3:05:10| have tried to be a student of zoning and the MPC and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11110)|
| 3:05:14| And I'd like to ask Scott Smith, since he's a relatively new MPC Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11114)|
| 3:05:22| that when you were sworn in, were you given a section of Knox County that you were responsible for as an MPC Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11122)|
| 3:05:30| Because this is absolutely news to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11130)|
| 3:05:37| I really don't want to be disrespectful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11137)|
| 3:05:41| I'm really uncomfortable with crossing that back and forth on MPC and this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11141)|
| 3:05:46| These are nice folks I've been meeting with, and we've been working on this a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11146)|
| 3:05:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11151)|
| 3:05:52| But, I mean, when you were on the BZA, you had a section of territory that you were responsible for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11152)|
| 3:05:56| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11156)|
| 3:05:59| I mean, I live in West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11159)|
| 3:06:01| But you were not the 4th District Representative on the BZA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11161)|
| 3:06:04| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11164)|
| 3:06:05| But, I mean, what I'm getting to is I'm just a little confused on why the neighbors should have gone to the MPC Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11165)|
| 3:06:13| that handles that area because there isn't one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11173)|
| 3:06:17| Yeah, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11177)|
| 3:06:20| You know, this whole thing is about is two units an acre appropriate for this property or three, and that's really all it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11180)|
| 3:06:28| And at some point, I hate wasting these people's time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11188)|
| 3:06:31| We've been doing this a long time, and they are nice people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11191)|
| 3:06:33| And I really feel bad that I've wasted them taking all their time up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11193)|
| 3:06:36| But, you know, I think the thing, if we lose at three units an acre, I'm almost fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11196)|
| 3:06:41| I mean, I don't want to lose this because it's a good piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11201)|
| 3:06:44| It makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11204)|
| 3:06:46| But I think maybe the best thing to do when you guys are ready, and I don't mean any disrespect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11206)|
| 3:06:50| is just kind of vote it up or down at some point at three, and then we'll, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11210)|
| 3:06:56| I just think that's the bottom line, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11216)|
| 3:07:00| Anyway, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11220)|
| 3:07:02| Commissioner Carringer, do you have a request, a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11222)|
| 3:07:06| Well, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11226)|
| 3:07:07| I just wanted to say to Charlie and everybody else, I'm not saying no to the property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11227)|
| 3:07:12| I'm just trying to figure out how many acres we're talking about, what we're voting on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11232)|
| 3:07:17| and to make the point that when you change zoning, the zoning goes with the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11237)|
| 3:07:24| Whether or not Mr. Daniel sells this property to Mr. Smith or Mr. Mosley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11244)|
| 3:07:31| once the zoning is changed, it goes with the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11251)|
| 3:07:35| So it's important to all the other Knox County property owners to know what to expect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11255)|
| 3:07:44| or what's happening in their area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11264)|
| 3:07:47| So I just want to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11267)|
| 3:07:49| I don't think anybody's up here trying to say no to property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11269)|
| 3:07:54| But it is very important how we rezone, because once it's rezoned, as I say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11274)|
| 3:08:01| it stays with the property regardless who he sells it to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11281)|
| 3:08:05| So I just want to clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11285)|
| 3:08:07| And the biggest question is that there's still all these different numbers of acreage floating around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11287)|
| 3:08:14| and it's, you know, at the last meeting I think the log cabin was stated that it was on three-quarter of an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11294)|
| 3:08:24| and that it was included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11304)|
| 3:08:25| So then tonight I'm hearing it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11305)|
| 3:08:28| So there again, I just want to clarify I'm here for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11308)|
| 3:08:33| I'm representing everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11313)|
| 3:08:34| I'm just trying to figure out what is really taking place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11314)|
| 3:08:41| Mr. Green, did you have a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11321)|
| 3:08:43| Just to try to answer Commissioner Carringer's property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11323)|
| 3:08:47| the rezoning is for the property as shown on the maps provided with your rezoning request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11327)|
| 3:08:55| The acreage is 40.34 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11335)|
| 3:08:58| That includes the house Mr. Smith lives on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11338)|
| 3:09:01| And I do not believe it includes the log cabin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11341)|
| 3:09:04| And looking at that, it does not appear the log cabin is included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11344)|
| 3:09:09| The density approved by the commission for the zoning would be calculated for the 40 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11349)|
| 3:09:17| The planned residential zoning allows a variety of lot sizes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11357)|
| 3:09:21| If they decide to cut out the two-acre tract with Mr. Smith's current home, that would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11361)|
| 3:09:28| The rest of the property could be developed so that the overall density is no greater than three units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11368)|
| 3:09:35| if that's what the commission approves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11375)|
| 3:09:38| Commissioner Nystrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11378)|
| 3:09:41| Just a quick point of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11381)|
| 3:09:43| I've been hearing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11383)|
| 3:09:44| I heard what Charles had mentioned earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11384)|
| 3:09:46| And Commissioner Green, just to clarify this, in the future, I mean, where this gets complicated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11386)|
| 3:09:51| I know is that some of our developers are I guess it's been kind of routine to submit their plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11391)|
| 3:09:57| almost within a very close window of when the zoning is proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11397)|
| 3:10:01| We have situations where the developers have spent a lot of money on these plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11401)|
| 3:10:04| where maybe even the zoning isn't approved yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11404)|
| 3:10:07| In the future, does your office have any plans to maybe kind of postpone accepting the plans for these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11407)|
| 3:10:15| until the zoning is actually approved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11415)|
| 3:10:17| That almost speaks to Charles's point, you know, that we're not on this end putting those conditions in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11417)|
| 3:10:22| that we do the zoning and then you all do the plans kind of after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11422)|
| 3:10:27| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11427)|
| 3:10:28| And we are looking at our processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11428)|
| 3:10:30| And one of the things we'll be looking at is to not accept concept plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11430)|
| 3:10:34| until the zoning is approved by this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11434)|
| 3:10:37| I think it sends a bad message to the community that there's something underfoot that the rezoning is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11437)|
| 3:10:48| You just provide a rubber stamp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11448)|
| 3:10:50| And as we can see on this action, you do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11450)|
| 3:10:54| And also we hope to save the developers money when there are challenges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11454)|
| 3:10:59| and this commission may differ from the planning commission on the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11459)|
| 3:11:04| We're trying to just make things smoother for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11464)|
| 3:11:08| Commissioner Gill, do you have a question of the presenters?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11468)|
| 3:11:11| Yes, it's actually Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11471)|
| 3:11:13| Could we just review the three conditions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11473)|
| 3:11:20| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11480)|
| 3:11:21| First condition is that lots at above parcels 132-049.01 and 132-049.12| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11481)|
| 3:11:33| must have an average lot size of one acre with no lot being less than .75 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11493)|
| 3:11:39| Condition two is lots at above parcels 132-050 and 132-050.02| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11499)|
| 3:11:49| must have an average lot size of .5 acres with no lot being less than .4 acres in size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11509)|
| 3:11:55| Condition number three is that prior to approval of a final plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11515)|
| 3:11:59| or issuance of any building permits for development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11519)|
| 3:12:03| proposed at a density of greater than one dwelling unit per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11523)|
| 3:12:07| millstone lane must be improved to a minimum of 20 feet in width| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11527)|
| 3:12:10| from the entrance of the development to the improved portion to the east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11530)|
| 3:12:14| And a five-foot wide sidewalk must be installed on the south side of millstone lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11534)|
| 3:12:19| from the development entrance to the existing sidewalk to the east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11539)|
| 3:12:23| And again, the purpose of those first two conditions was to provide some type of buffer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11543)|
| 3:12:28| or transition from the higher density of the proposed development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11548)|
| 3:12:32| to the lower density of the existing development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11552)|
| 3:12:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11555)|
| 3:12:38| Commissioner Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11558)|
| 3:12:39| In reference to that, Mr. Green,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11559)|
| 3:12:40| would it not be easier to design and develop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11560)|
| 3:12:44| if you just had a conservation between those lots instead of a required acreage on those lots?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11564)|
| 3:12:50| I'm sure it would be, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11570)|
| 3:12:52| What kind of setback does it have currently from those lots?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11572)|
| 3:12:58| If you just approved it without the restriction, what would the setback be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11578)|
| 3:13:01| About 35 feet in the rear setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11581)|
| 3:13:05| And Mr. Seymour, you were talking about a conservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11585)|
| 3:13:07| What amount of feet were you talking about in that conservation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11587)|
| 3:13:14| If I could get Mr. Smith to answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11594)|
| 3:13:16| Either one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11596)|
| 3:13:19| The 35-foot peripherals from that back lot line in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11599)|
| 3:13:23| what we were trying to do, a lot of that border where those properties adjoin is wooded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11603)|
| 3:13:28| So they really don't have a problem with visual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11608)|
| 3:13:31| but there is a section that doesn't have any trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11611)|
| 3:13:33| So we're trying to think of a way that we could offer to put some trees in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11613)|
| 3:13:37| We don't want the new property owners to come along and cut those trees down after we build houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11617)|
| 3:13:42| so we put a conservation easement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11622)|
| 3:13:44| and we wrap these folks' affected properties with a conservation easement so nobody can mess with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11624)|
| 3:13:51| How many feet are you talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11631)|
| 3:13:52| I get the concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11632)|
| 3:13:55| 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11635)|
| 3:13:56| It was 30 to 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11636)|
| 3:13:57| It varies depending on where it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11637)|
| 3:14:00| It's just a sketch, but it's what we're prepared to do and what makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11640)|
| 3:14:07| We offered to either put the trees on our side, put the trees on their side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11647)|
| 3:14:12| give them the money for the trees, let them buy whatever trees they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11652)|
| 3:14:15| We were trying to do what we could in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11655)|
| 3:14:19| So on that restriction, the conservation easement of 50 feet, that's a property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11659)|
| 3:14:23| Is that what we're talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11663)|
| 3:14:25| It varies, doesn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11665)|
| 3:14:26| It varies, 30 to 50 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11666)|
| 3:14:29| It goes over a considerable area, so that's why I just can't say, oh, it's 30 feet the whole way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11669)|
| 3:14:34| Where it can be bigger, it was bigger when it was a little smaller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11674)|
| 3:14:37| I think in some cases maybe, what, 35 was the smallest point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11677)|
| 3:14:40| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11680)|
| 3:14:41| So if there was a caveat that said, if it's approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11681)|
| 3:14:45| that said the conservation between the lots affected to act as a buffer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11685)|
| 3:14:48| you would be comfortable with that in the zoning and let them work it out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11688)|
| 3:14:52| We actually proposed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11692)|
| 3:14:53| Yeah, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11693)|
| 3:14:54| That's what we were trying to think of something to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11694)|
| 3:14:57| That's more practical to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11697)|
| 3:14:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11698)|
| 3:14:59| All right, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11699)|
| 3:15:00| Commissioner Smith, do you have a question of the presenters?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11700)|
| 3:15:04| I actually have a question of Mr. Green and perhaps Mr. Smith also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11704)|
| 3:15:08| and I was going to dwell on that same point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11708)|
| 3:15:14| Do we have any engineering drawings that it's even possible to put an acre lot there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11714)|
| 3:15:18| and still get the road in with the distance from frills?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11718)|
| 3:15:24| We do not have a plan that shows that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11724)|
| 3:15:27| To create a lot of that size would be one that's long and relatively shallow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11727)|
| 3:15:34| wide and shallow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11734)|
| 3:15:39| Yes, sir, you can answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11739)|
| 3:15:43| The question was, can we fit a one-acre lot in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11743)|
| 3:15:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11746)|
| 3:15:47| It would look really weird.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11747)|
| 3:15:48| I mean, you're going to have, on one side of the road, smaller lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11748)|
| 3:15:52| On the other side of the road, you're going to have some big, long piece of ground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11752)|
| 3:15:55| to measure up to one acre or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11755)|
| 3:15:58| To me, it's just kind of a goofy thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11758)|
| 3:16:00| But would it give you distance between frills and the entrance to the subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11760)|
| 3:16:03| for the required distance between two roads that intersect the same road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11763)|
| 3:16:09| Okay, say that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11769)|
| 3:16:10| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11770)|
| 3:16:12| Would it give you enough distance between frills and the entrance to your subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11772)|
| 3:16:16| if you had long, narrow lots on this side?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11776)|
| 3:16:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11780)|
| 3:16:21| I mean, the long, narrow lots that would be from our proposed road backing up to frills, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11781)|
| 3:16:29| They would have to be very small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11789)|
| 3:16:32| And then on the right side of the road where it backs up to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11792)|
| 3:16:34| I mean, it would just be impractical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11794)|
| 3:16:36| I think it would look strange if you pulled in a neighborhood and you had—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11796)|
| 3:16:39| I'm wondering if it's even engineered, if it's possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11799)|
| 3:16:42| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11802)|
| 3:16:46| It would be very strange and difficult, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11806)|
| 3:16:52| Seeing no further questions of the presenters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11812)|
| 3:16:54| we'll enter into a phase of deliberation amongst the commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11814)|
| 3:16:58| on the issues that we have before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11818)|
| 3:17:05| Discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11825)|
| 3:17:11| I just want to confirm the motion that was on the floor from last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11831)|
| 3:17:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11834)|
| 3:17:15| The motion that was on the floor from last month was to delay a month to have additional input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11835)|
| 3:17:22| So there's no motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11842)|
| 3:17:24| That's what we're entering into now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11844)|
| 3:17:26| Two breakers out because of the delay or the motion to move to this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11846)|
| 3:17:32| No, there is no motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11852)|
| 3:17:34| There's no motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11854)|
| 3:17:35| There's no motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11855)|
| 3:17:37| We are in the discussion phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11857)|
| 3:17:40| We are approaching a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11860)|
| 3:17:46| Who's going to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11866)|
| 3:17:53| Commissioner Bessler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11873)|
| 3:17:54| Now, what would be the motion if one was made?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11874)|
| 3:17:59| I'm not going to make one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11879)|
| 3:18:01| I mean, are we going to approve as MPC recommendation is probably what the motion would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11881)|
| 3:18:06| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11886)|
| 3:18:07| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11887)|
| 3:18:08| Somebody's got to make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11888)|
| 3:18:09| Somebody's got to make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11889)|
| 3:18:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11890)|
| 3:18:11| The only reason why I'm asking this is there's some conditions on here which is conditional zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11891)|
| 3:18:17| I'm not comfortable with conditional zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11897)|
| 3:18:22| And I just want to know what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11902)|
| 3:18:25| So just let somebody know that I'm not, you know, on that condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11905)|
| 3:18:29| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11909)|
| 3:18:30| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11910)|
| 3:18:32| To get things started, I will make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11912)|
| 3:18:35| And I am okay with the condition upon the street improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11915)|
| 3:18:40| But I would make a motion at three units an acre with a conservative buffer and eliminate conditions one and two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11920)|
| 3:18:54| Did I hear a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11934)|
| 3:18:55| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11935)|
| 3:18:57| Is there any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11937)|
| 3:19:00| MPC, eliminate MPCs one and two conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11940)|
| 3:19:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11944)|

| 3:19:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11947)|
| 3:19:08| The first condition was to have some lots that were the one acre size to abut adjacent property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11948)|
| 3:19:18| Condition two was to have some half acre or dot four acre lots abut other adjacent property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11958)|

| 3:19:31| With a buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11971)|
| 3:19:33| And substitute those two conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11973)|
| 3:19:35| And what is Commissioner Smith, your?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11975)|

| 3:19:51| Did somebody restate that while we're making a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11991)|
| 3:19:56| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11996)|
| 3:19:58| I move for approval at three units an acre removing condition one and two and inserting a conservative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=11998)|

| 3:20:08| Conservation buffer and keeping condition three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=12008)|
| 3:20:12| And we've got a second on that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=12012)|
| 3:20:16| So we're in discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=12016)|
| 3:20:17| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=12017)|
| 3:20:19| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=12019)|
| 3:20:20| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=12020)|
| 3:20:21| I'd like to make a substitute motion that we approve the MPC recommendation of all three conditions with setting the density at 2.0 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=12021)|
| 3:20:35| And you're entering a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=12035)|
| 3:20:39| Is there a discussion of the substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=12039)|

| 3:20:50| It has been seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=12050)|
| 3:20:52| Now we're open for discussion on the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=12052)|
| 3:21:00| I'd like to make a point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=12060)|
| 3:21:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=12062)|
| 3:21:03| If this substitute motion gathers six votes, I would like, before you announce it, I'd like to allow the applicant to withdraw so we don't put a condition on his land that he doesn't want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=12063)|
| 3:21:12| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=12072)|
| 3:21:17| What is before us is a substitute motion phrased by Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=12077)|

| 3:23:24| Would you restate the original motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=12204)|
| 3:23:30| You're going to get the word right this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=12210)|
| 3:23:34| I make a motion that we approve per MPC's recommendation of three units an acre, eliminating condition one and two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=12214)|
| 3:23:42| and inserting a conservation buffer that's been presented and keeping condition three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=12222)|
| 3:23:50| You did restate it as you stated it originally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=12230)|
| 3:23:53| I believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=12233)|
| 3:23:54| I said the word right this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=12234)|
| 3:23:58| I've got just a point of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=12238)|
| 3:24:01| The conservation easement that you mentioned, would that be a condition on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=12241)|
| 3:24:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=12245)|
| 3:24:06| Just to be clear that there are two conditions on the result.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=12246)|
| 3:24:10| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=12250)|
| 3:24:11| The road and the conservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=12251)|
| 3:24:12| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=12252)|
| 3:24:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=12253)|
| 3:24:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=12255)|
| 3:24:16| Can we just state that clearly with those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=12256)|
| 3:24:19| Because I'm a little confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=12259)|
| 3:24:21| Three units, the road improvements, and then the conservation easement to buffer the properties per whatever acreage is subdivided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=12261)|
| 3:24:33| Whatever is approved by the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=12273)|
| 3:24:35| Whatever is approved by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=12275)|
| 3:24:36| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=12276)|
| 3:24:37| I just need to make sure that is what we're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=12277)|
| 3:24:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=12279)|
| 3:24:40| Because that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=12280)|
| 3:24:41| We move to the sixth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=12281)|
| 3:24:42| Because that got a little fuzzy on the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=12282)|
| 3:24:47| Seeing no further discussion, motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=12287)|
| 3:24:51| We will have roll call vote beginning in district six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=12291)|

| 3:25:41| I don't like conditional zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=12341)|
| 3:25:44| So you put a condition on the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=12344)|

| 3:33:34| Not anymore than I'm aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=12814)|
| 3:33:37| No, I said no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=12817)|
| 3:33:39| Is that a fair statement, what I was saying about when you get a new MPC Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=12819)|
| 3:33:44| you do not assign them a district to be responsible for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=12824)|
