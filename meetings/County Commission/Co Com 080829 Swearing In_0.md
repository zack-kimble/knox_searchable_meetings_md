| 0:00:00| Good morning. Let me try this one more time. Good morning. We are delighted you are here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=0)|
| 0:00:12| today as we celebrate democracy in our community with the installation of our new elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=12)|
| 0:00:18| This is a very special time. I was reflecting this morning as I was entering the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=18)|
| 0:00:23| how blessed we are to live in Knox County. We live in a community that has a very good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=23)|
| 0:00:29| school system moving toward a great one. We live in a region that has one of the state's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=29)|
| 0:00:35| lowest unemployment rates where we are consistently creating new and better jobs for our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=35)|
| 0:00:42| We live in a community that is faith based and when bad things happen we pull together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=42)|
| 0:00:49| work together and tackle those challenges head on and comfort one another in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=49)|
| 0:00:54| Today is very special for us in Knox County. I think it is incredibly appropriate that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=54)|
| 0:00:58| we begin our program with prayer. Elder Reginald Strong from the community Evangelical Presbyterian| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=58)|
| 0:01:07| Church will lead us in prayer. Elder Strong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=67)|
| 0:01:15| Let us bow. God we thank you for this day. For this is the day that the Lord had made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=75)|
| 0:01:20| and we are going to rejoice and be glad in it. We just invoke your presence and we ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=80)|
| 0:01:24| that you would anoint each person that is going to be installed this day that your perfect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=84)|
| 0:01:28| will might be done. Now just occupy this place with your spirit. In Christ's name we pray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=88)|
| 0:01:35| Amen. If you will please stand we will have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=95)|
| 0:01:38| pledge to the flag. Our pledge today will be led by Dr. Jim McIntyre who is our new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=98)|
| 0:01:44| director of schools and I can tell you he is off to a really great start. Dr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=104)|
| 0:01:49| Thank you. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=109)|
| 0:01:59| republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=119)|
| 0:02:07| for all. Thank you Dr. McIntyre. We are fortunate today to have four outstanding young folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=127)|
| 0:02:16| from Central High School with us. Bailey Stites, Tara Quorum, Hunter Baird, and Josh Archer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=136)|
| 0:02:25| They are from the Central High School Choir. As we all know it has been a tough couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=145)|
| 0:02:31| of days for Central High School and normally we do this after our National Anthem but would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=151)|
| 0:02:36| you please join me in giving them a round of applause before they sing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=156)|
| 0:02:40| Applause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=160)|
| 0:02:59| Please remain standing for our National Anthem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=179)|
| 0:03:05| Oh say can you see by the dawn's early light| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=185)|
| 0:03:12| What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=192)|
| 0:03:21| Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=201)|
| 0:03:29| O'er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=209)|
| 0:03:37| And the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=217)|
| 0:03:46| Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=226)|
| 0:03:55| Oh say does that star-spangled banner yet wave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=235)|
| 0:04:05| O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=245)|
| 0:04:23| Applause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=263)|
| 0:04:42| We will begin our installation with our Criminal Court Judge Bob McGee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=282)|
| 0:04:46| The oath will be administered by Judge Dale Workman, his escorts are Lana, Ray, Harvey McGee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=286)|

| 0:05:09| if you'll come and face this direction, the reason we're doing that is so these people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=309)|
| 0:05:13| can get your picture so you can be on TV and stand right back over there in front of the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=313)|
| 0:05:22| And if those who are doing the oath will stand a little bit to the side so they make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=322)|
| 0:05:26| and get their picture on TV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=326)|
| 0:05:29| For those holding the Bible, please stand on the office holder's left-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=329)|
| 0:05:32| no, over in front of the mic there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=332)|
| 0:05:36| Stand on the office holder's left side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=336)|
| 0:05:39| Judge McGee, come on up, folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=339)|
| 0:05:41| Y'all get to be close and in the picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=341)|

| 0:41:40| We now have all commissioners present. The floor is now open for nomination for chairman of the Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=2500)|
| 0:41:47| We'll start off in roll call in the first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=2507)|
| 0:41:51| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=2511)|
| 0:41:54| Thank you, Mr. Arnett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=2514)|
| 0:41:57| It is with great humility and honor that I enter the name of Thomas E. Tank Strickland, Jr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=2517)|
| 0:42:11| into consideration for the chairman of this Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=2531)|
| 0:42:18| There's been several dark days and nights, and Tank has guided us with the care and calmness that is needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=2538)|
| 0:42:27| He's fairly dealt with the issues, difficult issues from difficult people, both on the commission and in the general public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=2547)|
| 0:42:37| and myself included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=2557)|
| 0:42:39| And he's facilitated us through this process with extreme, again, care and consideration and fairness through these difficult days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=2559)|
| 0:42:53| But it's not over. It's not over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=2573)|
| 0:42:57| We still have a great chasm that we need to continue to sail across to win the public trust for a lasting and permanent, I would hope, reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=2577)|
| 0:43:13| So it's with those things and several others that I'd like to nominate Tank Strickland to remain as the chair for the Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=2593)|
| 0:43:26| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=2606)|
| 0:43:29| It doesn't need a second right now, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=2609)|
| 0:43:32| Okay, thank you, Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=2612)|

| 0:43:50| Commissioner Saunders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=2630)|
| 0:43:51| Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=2631)|
| 0:43:52| Commissioner Shouse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=2632)|
| 0:43:53| Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=2633)|

| 0:43:56| Commissioner Leuthold?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=2636)|
| 0:43:57| Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=2637)|
| 0:43:58| Commissioner Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=2638)|
| 0:44:00| I would like to also echo a lot of what Commissioner McKenzie said about Commissioner Strickland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=2640)|
| 0:44:09| in that I think the county owes him a great deal of gratitude for what he did, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=2649)|
| 0:44:14| particularly when we had the appointment process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=2654)|
| 0:44:16| Everyone was waiting for something to go wrong, and it didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=2656)|
| 0:44:18| It was handled very well, and I do think he's been a fair commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=2658)|
| 0:44:22| There's four commissioners that sits on this body that have been here now six years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=2662)|
| 0:44:28| Two of them have been chairmen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=2668)|
| 0:44:31| One of those who has expressed interest on our forum is Craig Leuthold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=2671)|
| 0:44:38| Craig, by anybody's measure, has been a fair commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=2678)|
| 0:44:42| He's not belonged to any of the factions that existed before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=2682)|
| 0:44:49| He has a great deal of knowledge of the history of this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=2689)|
| 0:44:53| and for that reason I'm honored to nominate him for the position of chairman of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=2693)|
| 0:45:01| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=2701)|
| 0:45:03| Commissioner Andrews?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=2703)|
| 0:45:04| Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=2704)|

| 0:45:07| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=2707)|

| 0:45:15| Commissioner Pinkston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=2715)|
| 0:45:16| Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=2716)|
| 0:45:17| Make the nomination cease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=2717)|
| 0:45:20| Make the nomination cease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=2720)|
| 0:45:22| I would like to make a nomination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=2722)|
| 0:45:25| Mr. Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=2725)|
| 0:45:29| I think I certainly agree in every way with Commissioner McKenzie about Tank, Commissioner, the chair, Mr. Strickland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=2729)|
| 0:45:45| and certainly it's been a most difficult time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=2745)|
| 0:45:47| He's helped us stabilize many diverse opinions and obviously controversy and emotions that take place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=2747)|
| 0:45:59| and he has handled this with great skill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=2759)|
| 0:46:09| But certainly there's another issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=2769)|
| 0:46:12| There is an issue that's important to me in terms of probably taking us back historically to a place in front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=2772)|
| 0:46:23| of when this most difficult period in Knox County began in 06 or shortly thereafter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=2783)|
| 0:46:35| And for that reason, I think it would also be wise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=2795)|
| 0:46:40| or I'm certainly drawn to nominate someone who has a disconnect to the process that's evolved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=2800)|
| 0:46:52| or the difficulties that we've had and all of the associated problems that took place on the so-called Black Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=2812)|
| 0:47:03| And for that reason, we have several people that are certainly qualified to be chair of this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=2823)|
| 0:47:13| But there's one that strikes me as especially qualified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=2833)|
| 0:47:19| and especially exempt from the kind of baggage which we might attach to some of us that have been here for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=2839)|
| 0:47:32| And certainly he's qualified in many ways as a leader, as a respected physician,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=2852)|
| 0:47:42| has served and led men in the armed forces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=2862)|
| 0:47:49| And for this reason, I would like to nominate Dr. Richard Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=2869)|
| 0:47:57| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=2877)|
| 0:47:59| There's been a motion to cease the nominations. Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=2879)|
| 0:48:03| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=2883)|
| 0:48:04| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=2884)|
| 0:48:06| If not, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=2886)|
| 0:48:07| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=2887)|
| 0:48:08| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=2888)|
| 0:48:10| And the ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=2890)|
| 0:48:14| Okay, we'll start with a roll call now in the first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=2894)|
| 0:48:18| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=2898)|
| 0:48:20| Thanks, Strickland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=2900)|

| 0:59:55| There you have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=3595)|
| 1:00:00| That was a little bit unexpected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=3600)|
| 1:00:03| I want to thank the commissioners that supported me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=3603)|
| 1:00:05| and it's an honor to sit here next to Tank Strickland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=3605)|

| 1:00:27| I guess the next thing on the agenda, we need to do committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=3627)|
| 1:00:32| Own committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=3632)|
| 1:00:38| A couple of people that were on it from the last time, I'd like for them to stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=3638)|
| 1:00:42| That's Sam McKenzie and Greg Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=3642)|

| 1:00:50| Would you like to, Mr. Sanders, Commissioner Sanders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=3650)|
| 1:00:53| Committee on committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=3653)|
| 1:00:55| What this does is divides the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=3655)|
| 1:00:58| Half will be on the intergovernmental and the other half will be on finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=3658)|
| 1:01:03| I'd be happy to be on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=3663)|
| 1:01:08| Dave Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=3668)|

| 1:01:18| Take them in that back room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=3678)|
| 1:01:20| Take them in the back room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=3680)|
| 1:01:22| Mr. Chairman, as that committee does its work, I respectfully request that I be put on finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=3682)|
| 1:01:27| It will fit my teaching schedule better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=3687)|
| 1:01:34| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=3694)|
| 1:01:35| I think we had another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=3695)|
| 1:01:37| Excuse my ignorance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=3697)|
| 1:01:38| Does this also determine the appointments to beer board and BZA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=3698)|
| 1:01:43| in addition to intergovernmental finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=3703)|
| 1:01:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=3705)|
| 1:01:46| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=3706)|
| 1:01:48| And the rest of the committees are supposed to be at the chairman's discretion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=3708)|
| 1:01:53| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=3713)|

| 1:07:57| I didn't catch that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4077)|
| 1:07:58| You had to be on one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4078)|
| 1:08:00| Did we also get Ed Schaus on one of those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4080)|
| 1:08:04| I thought that was finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4084)|

| 1:09:45| but I believe William Daniels said that he was resigning because when he took the BZA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4185)|
| 1:09:52| somebody asked him if he would resign after his appointment, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4192)|
| 1:09:58| He would have to submit a letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4198)|

| 1:11:31| since we're gathering here anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4291)|
| 1:11:33| Well, I think we need to have a ten-day legal notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4293)|
| 1:11:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4295)|
| 1:11:37| And then after that have the hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4297)|
| 1:11:39| After the hearing, then we would have a meeting here in the main assembly room to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4299)|
| 1:11:43| and we would just need to work out the dates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4303)|
| 1:11:45| Well, I had a few dates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4305)|
| 1:11:47| I figured having a ten-day legal notice would run somewhere around the 10th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4307)|
| 1:11:53| give everyone chances to view it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4313)|
| 1:11:57| I figured if we could do it on the 19th or the 24th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4317)|
| 1:12:02| I think the 19th is probably the earliest to give everyone a comfortable amount of time to review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4322)|
| 1:12:10| Mr. Chairman, I think I'm going to be gone on the 19th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4330)|
| 1:12:15| I think I have a conflict on the 24th, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4335)|
| 1:12:18| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4338)|
| 1:12:19| Isn't that the day or two after the commission meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4339)|
| 1:12:21| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4341)|
| 1:12:25| Mr. Chairman, have we decided on a date for just to hear from the different applicants, the hearing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4345)|
| 1:12:34| Half of us will be here either on the 15th or 16th, which is the two committee days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4354)|
| 1:12:42| It might be a good time to maybe have some type of public input at that point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4362)|
| 1:12:47| and then maybe have the actual appointment date on another day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4367)|
| 1:12:53| but at least that's a day that we know is free here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4373)|
| 1:12:56| and at least half of us would already be scheduled to be here, just something to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4376)|
| 1:13:01| Well, it doesn't matter to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4381)|
| 1:13:03| When you say hearing, you're talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4383)|
| 1:13:05| Given the applicants a chance to come before this body and then the public a chance to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4385)|
| 1:13:15| The last time we did that, we went ahead and voted that particular day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4395)|
| 1:13:20| I would think that would be a good procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4400)|
| 1:13:22| Maybe say 1 p.m. on the 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4402)|
| 1:13:24| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4404)|
| 1:13:25| Or the 16th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4405)|
| 1:13:27| Well, I'm thinking immediately following either committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4407)|
| 1:13:32| Those that are already here in the morning may not have to wait until 1 o'clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4412)|
| 1:13:37| because hopefully the committees will be not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4417)|
| 1:13:42| I knew there was a reason I didn't write the 15th and 16th down for my date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4422)|
| 1:13:51| We as commissioners will have to have agenda quick training on the 15th and 16th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4431)|
| 1:13:58| This is some training for our computers, new procedures that we're going through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4438)|
| 1:14:05| Going to do it on both days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4445)|
| 1:14:07| Well, the ones that are intergovernmental will do it on their day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4447)|
| 1:14:11| and the ones that are on finance will do it on their day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4451)|
| 1:14:14| But, Jody, the training is from 10 to 12, finance or intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4454)|
| 1:14:27| It's an hour training, so we still could do it either day at 1 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4467)|
| 1:14:33| Are you referring, would you mean interview in a public hearing and also vote that day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4473)|
| 1:14:40| or just the information from the candidates?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4480)|
| 1:14:42| It's up to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4482)|
| 1:14:43| However we want to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4483)|
| 1:14:45| I would suggest that we hear them one day and we set a vote date off a few days later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4485)|
| 1:14:53| I just hope we can work it out where you and I can both be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4493)|
| 1:14:57| Mr. Chairman, I will be like Commissioner Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4497)|
| 1:15:00| I'll be out on the 24th also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4500)|
| 1:15:06| I don't know if there's any reason why we couldn't have it done on the 22nd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4506)|
| 1:15:11| which is our regular commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4511)|
| 1:15:14| Maybe have that be the first item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4514)|
| 1:15:17| Yeah, the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4517)|
| 1:15:18| We could have that be the first item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4518)|
| 1:15:20| Let's do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4520)|
| 1:15:22| That's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4522)|
| 1:15:24| Mr. Chair, the 15th is bad for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4524)|
| 1:15:33| That's why I was wondering, could we do it on the 16th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4533)|
| 1:15:35| But I know Commissioner Harmon has scheduling issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4535)|
| 1:15:41| But the 15th is bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4541)|
| 1:15:44| What about the 17th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4544)|
| 1:15:47| That works for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4547)|
| 1:15:50| 17th at what time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4550)|
| 1:15:53| What time are you looking at on the 17th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4553)|
| 1:15:57| Well, I can't do it on the 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4557)|
| 1:15:59| I just might as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4559)|
| 1:16:01| I'm having surgery on the 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4561)|
| 1:16:04| What about the 18th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4564)|
| 1:16:11| This process isn't going to be a long process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4571)|
| 1:16:14| So we could look at a, I hate to say it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4574)|
| 1:16:17| but a four or five o'clock session as well, just throwing it out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4577)|
| 1:16:22| I mean, it's not like this is going to be a long and exhaustive process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4582)|
| 1:16:27| Commissioner Harmon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4587)|
| 1:16:29| Can we lock down that we will vote on the 22nd?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4589)|
| 1:16:33| I think that's an excellent idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4593)|
| 1:16:35| Commissioner Mark Harmon, you said you have a problem on Tuesdays?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4595)|
| 1:16:39| Well, Tuesdays and Thursdays I teach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4599)|
| 1:16:41| I just didn't know if there was a certain time on those days that you could be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4601)|
| 1:16:46| Oh, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4606)|
| 1:16:47| I mean, I could be here from about 4 o'clock onward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4607)|
| 1:16:52| So maybe we could have one of those days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4612)|
| 1:16:56| Well, it sort of defeats the purpose because half of us would be here in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4616)|
| 1:17:01| Or, again, if you have, and I could probably find a colleague to switch a class if that's necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4621)|
| 1:17:10| I don't want to be the obstacle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4630)|
| 1:17:11| How about early morning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4631)|
| 1:17:13| Yeah, I could do an early morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4633)|
| 1:17:15| Maybe if we had the hearing like at 8.30 when intergovernmental would normally start,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4635)|
| 1:17:22| and then immediately following that we could have our intergovernmental meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4642)|
| 1:17:30| I don't think it's going to take too terribly long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4650)|
| 1:17:34| I don't mind any of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4654)|
| 1:17:36| What date specifically on the calendar are you looking at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4656)|
| 1:17:38| Well, that would be the 16th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4658)|
| 1:17:40| But we still have that training at 11 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4660)|
| 1:17:43| I mean, that has been set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4663)|
| 1:17:45| And I have a 940 class, but I'll have a colleague prepared to cover it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4665)|
| 1:17:49| So we'll work it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4669)|
| 1:17:50| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4670)|
| 1:17:51| On the 16th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4671)|
| 1:17:52| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4672)|
| 1:17:53| I think that's too much on that particular day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4673)|
| 1:17:56| Because we have to go through this training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4676)|
| 1:17:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4678)|
| 1:17:59| On the 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4679)|
| 1:18:01| It's going to be the same on the 15th or the 16th is what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4681)|
| 1:18:05| Well, you don't have that 11 o'clock training, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4685)|
| 1:18:07| Yes, you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4687)|
| 1:18:08| Yeah, we have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4688)|
| 1:18:09| We have the 11 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4689)|
| 1:18:10| Is it at 11?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4690)|
| 1:18:11| Yeah, 11 or 12 for both intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4691)|
| 1:18:14| What about, like, on Thursday, the 18th at 4 o'clock?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4694)|
| 1:18:18| Or 4.30?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4698)|
| 1:18:21| I'm fine with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4701)|
| 1:18:22| Sounds good to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4702)|
| 1:18:24| Thursday, the 18th, 4 o'clock, sounds good to everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4704)|
| 1:18:27| Right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4707)|
| 1:18:28| Is that okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4708)|
| 1:18:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4709)|
| 1:18:30| 18th at 4 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4710)|
| 1:18:31| 18th at 4 o'clock we will have hearings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4711)|
| 1:18:34| and question and answer period from the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4714)|
| 1:18:37| and also the judges that want the candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4717)|
| 1:18:43| Is that okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4723)|
| 1:18:44| And then we'll vote on the 22nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4724)|
| 1:18:46| We'll vote during commission meeting on the 22nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4726)|
| 1:18:49| Mr. Chairman, do we need to set a timetable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4729)|
| 1:18:51| for when materials need to be gotten to the commission office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4731)|
| 1:18:58| Say by the 12th, if we're going to do it on the 18th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4738)|
| 1:19:01| 12th is fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4741)|
| 1:19:04| Is that the Friday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4744)|
| 1:19:05| That's a Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4745)|
| 1:19:06| Close of business Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4746)|
| 1:19:07| Everybody has their materials and gives us adequate time to review them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4747)|
| 1:19:10| I think that's a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4750)|
| 1:19:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4752)|
| 1:19:13| So our candidates have to have their applications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4753)|
| 1:19:17| or whatever in to us by the 12th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4757)|
| 1:19:21| We will have a hearing at 4 o'clock on the 18th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4761)|
| 1:19:25| and then we'll vote on the 22nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4765)|
| 1:19:28| And, Mr. Chairman, I'd like for us to stick to that 12th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4768)|
| 1:19:31| None after that will we even look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4771)|
| 1:19:34| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4774)|
| 1:19:35| They've got 12 at 4.30?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4775)|
| 1:19:38| Go ahead and set a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829swearingin?start=4778)|
