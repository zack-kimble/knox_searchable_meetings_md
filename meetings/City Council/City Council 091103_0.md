| 0:02:49| back of the meeting. I'll second that motion. In discussion. Yes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=169)|
| 0:02:55| okay. It says in our record checks that one that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=175)|
| 0:02:59| the owner has not been in for processing. So do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=179)|
| 0:03:02| we want to move it to the end of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=182)|
| 0:03:03| agenda or do we want to. Just postpone it and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=183)|
| 0:03:07| this is in miss. Mrs. Peele's district. Do you want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=187)|
| 0:03:12| to answer that question. Mark. The the owner has not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=192)|
| 0:03:16| been in. It seems to me that there was. I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=196)|
| 0:03:25| trying to recall when when it was postponed from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=205)|
| 0:03:27| the last. Meeting. Exactly what the discussion was but there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=207)|
| 0:03:34| was some rationale for. This morning. Well I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=214)|
| 0:03:39| much I can't add much but we have been told| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=219)|
| 0:03:42| verbally that they want to withdraw this application but I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=222)|
| 0:03:45| guess that we don't have it in writing. I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=225)|
| 0:03:47| trying to remember that. I have not heard from from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=227)|
| 0:03:51| the owner. So. I guess the most prudent thing to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=231)|
| 0:03:57| do. Would. The record check in the packet dates to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=237)|
| 0:04:03| last July and I don't know that's the first time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=243)|
| 0:04:05| they came before us but at least we know. Well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=245)|
| 0:04:07| that's when that's when they opened when they were in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=247)|
| 0:04:10| the process of opening there. So that I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=250)|
| 0:04:13| dates back to the original. And his intent may not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=253)|
| 0:04:18| be to incorporate this into his business plan. But they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=258)|
| 0:04:22| are open and they are. Successfully working. Apparently there's no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=262)|
| 0:04:28| one here. So. Yeah I withdraw the motion and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=268)|
| 0:04:36| make a substitute motion to postpone it. To the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=276)|
| 0:04:39| schedule your board meeting. Maybe try to find out a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=279)|
| 0:04:42| little bit more between now and then. Would it. Is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=282)|
| 0:04:45| it ever appropriate for us to contact. The owner and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=285)|
| 0:04:49| and and ask. We'll be glad to indicate that council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=289)|
| 0:04:54| has asked for a formal withdrawal. Yes if that's his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=294)|
| 0:04:57| intention that would be helpful. We did we did call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=297)|
| 0:04:59| them. We'll be glad to write them. If you. Can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=299)|
| 0:05:05| we amend your motion to say that. They're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=305)|
| 0:05:07| be contacted by writing and writing. If I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=307)|

| 0:22:41| to accomplish so. Approximately when do you think you're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1361)|
| 0:22:46| to try to open well our goal actually was to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1366)|
| 0:22:49| open tomorrow. But within the last week we have found| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1369)|
| 0:22:54| out that the landlord are actually the liaison for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1374)|
| 0:22:57| landlord has gotten in contact with the current tenant. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1377)|
| 0:23:00| they've started negotiations. With this process so we've been kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1380)|
| 0:23:03| of you know. In limbo since then. So you're saying his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1383)|
| 0:23:08| lease is not being completed. The lease has been completed. It| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1388)|
| 0:23:13| was on a month to month to but he has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1393)|
| 0:23:15| not. He has an obligation that is correct. So now they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1395)|
| 0:23:19| in negotiations on trying to get that back on line so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1399)|
| 0:23:23| We're kind of. Up in the air if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1403)|
| 0:23:26| It is a current tenant still. Operating that is correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1406)|
| 0:23:30| you're selling beer tonight yes. They're making. Our legal counsel making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1410)|
| 0:23:39| correct me but we can't issue two permits to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1419)|
| 0:23:42| same look at the same at the same time. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1422)|
| 0:23:46| what do you know about his. One would replace the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1426)|
| 0:23:51| other one but they have to. Before you can get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1431)|
| 0:23:55| a permit it has to the other one has to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1435)|
| 0:23:57| be one has to be sure we've done we've we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1437)|
| 0:23:59| done it before yeah I mean it can't be formalized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1439)|
| 0:24:02| until it's turning we could vote yeah. So that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1442)|
| 0:24:06| come within the pending documentation. I think so. Scope of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1446)|
| 0:24:12| is that correct. I think so. Well. I realize you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1452)|
| 0:24:17| in. It's a difficult situation there. Well I don't give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1457)|
| 0:24:25| him one the other one goes away correct. Well when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1465)|
| 0:24:28| it's not really not until they turn it in until| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1468)|
| 0:24:31| they have surrendered in that right we have been in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1471)|
| 0:24:33| that situation before. You know where somebody doesn't want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1473)|
| 0:24:38| turn it in they want to keep operating. What do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1478)|
| 0:24:42| you do I don't think Miss Martin would issue their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1482)|
| 0:24:44| permit until that one has been turned in. So the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1484)|
| 0:24:48| people that are operating I'm familiar with rainbow club. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1488)|
| 0:24:52| don't eat raw fish there either. I know where you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1492)|
| 0:24:56| located. So I'm thinking. The permit holder. Now. Has he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1496)|
| 0:25:07| been located. By the landlord and is he actually. Running| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1507)|
| 0:25:13| the business. I'm not responsible. And we're not we're not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1513)|
| 0:25:18| purchasing anything from the current tenant but this is just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1518)|
| 0:25:21| a new venture upon ourselves. So to be honest with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1521)|
| 0:25:26| you I'm not really sure what's going on with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1526)|

| 0:28:07| was some confusion about. Something about it being in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1687)|
| 0:28:11| historic district which is not relevant at all. What is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1691)|
| 0:28:15| relevant is that. The the the owners before Mike Elliott| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1695)|

| 0:28:26| On premise so there needs to be a a use on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1706)|
| 0:28:30| review. In between these two thirty minutes thirty day extensions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1710)|
| 0:28:38| I I jumped in and. Tried to figure out how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1718)|
| 0:28:41| to help Mike and we went talk to Mark Donaldson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1721)|

| 0:28:49| to I did also want to say this before I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1729)|
| 0:28:52| I I ask you when I want to ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1732)|
| 0:28:54| you. This is a very important restaurant. In in my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1734)|
| 0:28:59| in my community Mechanicsville we are actually struggling with a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1739)|
| 0:29:03| lot of crime. The last city council meeting we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1743)|
| 0:29:10| There was a a big meeting at Clinton Chapel. About.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1750)|
| 0:29:15| The the the kind of upsurge of crime. Several days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1755)|
| 0:29:20| before that city council meeting behind my street there was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1760)|
| 0:29:23| somebody who unloaded you know a fifteen rounds of an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1763)|
| 0:29:27| nine millimeter. In the air. And so. There there is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1767)|
| 0:29:31| a lot of of struggle in in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1771)|
| 0:29:34| In this this this restaurant is is a. Bright light| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1774)|
| 0:29:38| in our community hires from the community. People come to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1778)|
| 0:29:42| to the restaurant from outside the community. And are are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1782)|
| 0:29:46| looking at our homes to buy so nothing but good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1786)|
| 0:29:48| stuff we have community meetings there. So so. Did you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1788)|
| 0:29:52| wanna add anything Mike. Yeah I would. I was reminded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1792)|
| 0:29:56| today when you stop by the restaurant. I had some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1796)|
| 0:29:59| friends stop in from Colorado who had been around my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1799)|
| 0:30:01| previous restaurants. And it reminded me of where I started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1801)|
| 0:30:06| with their and. Now that you would be aware of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1806)|
| 0:30:10| it or makes much difference but the restaurants have opened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1810)|
| 0:30:12| our. On par with anything in the world. And. That's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1812)|
| 0:30:19| not an exaggeration. And. To come before you you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1819)|
| 0:30:23| I saw this building where I am and it's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1823)|
| 0:30:26| exceptional building now. When I bought it it was not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1826)|
| 0:30:29| an exceptional building. And this is an empowerment zone and.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1829)|
| 0:30:34| It was one of their goals was to change this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1834)|
| 0:30:36| community and some of these buildings were important this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1836)|
| 0:30:38| one they considered very important. And I think I've done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1838)|
| 0:30:42| it better than I think anyone else would have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1842)|
| 0:30:47| And. Part of being successful in the restaurant business in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1847)|
| 0:30:52| my experience is to. Be able to provide all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1852)|
| 0:30:57| services. And for me I would like to have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1857)|
| 0:30:59| full liquor license. When I came before you first though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1859)|
| 0:31:04| We we talked about there was a lot of confusion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1864)|
| 0:31:06| on your part. As far as what your options were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1866)|
| 0:31:09| and what was going on. And we're talking about a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1869)|
| 0:31:11| beer license in a place that had served beer but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1871)|
| 0:31:14| It got talked about and tossed around jokingly. And. This is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1874)|
| 0:31:20| my livelihood. This is how I make my living and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1880)|
| 0:31:24| Joe Bailey I appreciate you in particular because I've never| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1884)|
| 0:31:27| met you before but it each meeting you stood up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1887)|
| 0:31:29| and you said what can we do for this. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1889)|
| 0:31:34| we didn't come up with satisfactory answers went to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1894)|
| 0:31:36| legal counsel said what we can do and he said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1896)|
| 0:31:39| we could postpone it or we can reject. And that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1899)|
| 0:31:42| is not the truth you also had another option and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1902)|
| 0:31:45| you could bring it before the council make a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1905)|
| 0:31:48| To waive that thousand dollar fee it's something that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1908)|
| 0:31:51| would not want to do to set a precedence. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1911)|
| 0:31:54| the same time this has been three years of restoration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1914)|
| 0:31:57| in a very. Difficult area when I started everyone said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1917)|
| 0:32:00| you can't do that can still you can't open the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1920)|
| 0:32:02| best restaurant Knoxville in mechanics will people will not come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1922)|
| 0:32:06| And that's not true. The sentinels already substantiated that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1926)|
| 0:32:10| know all the articles have been written and they've all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1930)|
| 0:32:12| been very very positive. Yeah and so and so it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1932)|
| 0:32:16| been very successful so the question is. I think I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1936)|
| 0:32:22| think what we need is another postponement but I also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1942)|
| 0:32:24| wanted to ask this council. Your feelings. Your your interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1944)|
| 0:32:29| or. Agreement if I introduced a resolution to waive the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1949)|
| 0:32:34| thousand dollar fee which he does not have. Is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1954)|
| 0:32:37| something that that you could agree to. In my mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1957)|
| 0:32:41| there's some legitimacy around it because. It it it it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1961)|
| 0:32:45| further. Increases the viability of the enterprise in a in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1965)|
| 0:32:50| a community that really needs this this enterprise. I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1970)|
| 0:32:53| necessarily feel like it's going to open the floodgates for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1973)|
| 0:32:56| for such practices. So I I'm. Here's some. Can I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1976)|
| 0:33:01| interject one more thing that happened simultaneous to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1981)|
| 0:33:05| beer board debacle. They were I'd asked for this business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1985)|
| 0:33:11| expansion loan I talked to. Community development about it and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1991)|
| 0:33:15| they encouraged me to go for something that would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1995)|
| 0:33:18| solved a lot of these issues. And they sent me sent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=1998)|
| 0:33:21| me through two months of a lot of work getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2001)|
| 0:33:24| architectural drawings and a lot of things together and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2004)|
| 0:33:26| I went before their board. And the decision makers weren't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2006)|
| 0:33:30| there and they told me I didn't qualify. And that. For| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2010)|
| 0:33:34| a small businessman I don't have time to be running| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2014)|
| 0:33:36| around. You know getting architectural drawings and doing a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2016)|
| 0:33:40| of monkey business and have somebody tell me. I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2020)|
| 0:33:42| even qualify when they had plenty of options to show| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2022)|
| 0:33:45| me along the way. Well that was frustrating and you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2025)|
| 0:33:49| know I'm sorry that that that happened. So. Back to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2029)|
| 0:33:53| my question. About Rebecca. I think this is a a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2033)|
| 0:33:58| use on review fee. Yeah I mean I think I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2038)|
| 0:34:01| think what we've got it it I would definitely support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2041)|
| 0:34:04| the resolution. I also think that in a funny way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2044)|
| 0:34:07| that the way we do fees like that. Discourage people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2047)|
| 0:34:10| from doing innovative projects like this minutes it's a it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2050)|
| 0:34:14| a very. Structurally it's not a good way but yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2054)|
| 0:34:17| Short term that makes a lot of sense. Councilman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2057)|
| 0:34:21| Roddy. Thank you chairman I'd like to thank councilman would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2061)|
| 0:34:25| offer doing the research on this and and working with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2065)|
| 0:34:28| this business center to try to try to find a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2068)|
| 0:34:30| solution. I think I could support that resolution particularly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2070)|
| 0:34:34| in despite I apologize for your recent disappointment with our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2074)|
| 0:34:37| department of community development I'm sorry that that happened on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2077)|
| 0:34:40| behalf of the city. But perhaps in working with miserable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2080)|
| 0:34:43| hair there could be some some language incorporated into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2083)|
| 0:34:47| As to the the empowerment zone designation and and how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2087)|
| 0:34:51| this building was singled out in that process resolution yeah| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2091)|
| 0:34:54| in the resolution and the importance of this particular structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2094)|
| 0:34:57| as as singled out in that study of this fragile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2097)|
| 0:35:00| area. You know and why it was important. And I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2100)|
| 0:35:03| been to your restaurant how the tomato soup and it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2103)|

| 0:35:30| you hear before and you referred to it as the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2130)|
| 0:35:33| debacle. I felt it was too. And I guess I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2133)|
| 0:35:38| didn't. You know blood trumpet like councilman Bailey. But I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2138)|
| 0:35:44| was very frustrated because I felt that we were not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2144)|
| 0:35:48| actually dealing with the situation that. We were dealing with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2148)|
| 0:35:53| I thought that we were trying to be. Difficult about something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2153)|
| 0:35:57| which. I thought to be a very positive thing for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2157)|
| 0:36:01| your for that area that neighborhood and I appreciate your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2161)|
| 0:36:06| patience. And it's it costs money to have patience when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2166)|
| 0:36:11| you're trying to do what you've been trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2171)|
| 0:36:14| So I personally just. Morally. Because of the way that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2174)|
| 0:36:20| was handled that evening. I definitely would support that resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2180)|
| 0:36:24| and I think it's absolutely incumbent upon us when we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2184)|
| 0:36:27| have aired. To make it right. And I hate to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2187)|
| 0:36:31| say it and probably our legal counsel will shoot me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2191)|
| 0:36:35| But I felt very strongly tonight that we aired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2195)|
| 0:36:39| And I appreciate your understanding that sometimes that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2199)|
| 0:36:47| That's my first thank you. I haven't been to your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2207)|
| 0:36:51| restaurant yet but it sounds good. But let me let| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2211)|
| 0:36:54| me ask this. You are I clearly remember the overlay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2214)|
| 0:36:59| issue that we had. Before and different things. If we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2219)|
| 0:37:05| get to the point where the proposed resolution comes on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2225)|
| 0:37:08| the agenda and passes. You know. Part of the reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2228)|
| 0:37:13| I assume you know that you you want to sell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2233)|
| 0:37:17| beer and sell liquor is to make it more attractive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2237)|
| 0:37:20| to patrons and hopefully. Help your bottom line out as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2240)|
| 0:37:23| well correct. I mean is it something where you consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2243)|
| 0:37:28| You know if this if everything works out. To. Make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2248)|
| 0:37:33| payments towards that way. I mean I don't mean to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2253)|
| 0:37:36| be. Crass or anything but you know I'm just trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2256)|
| 0:37:39| to think of you know. Is it possible. Of course| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2259)|
| 0:37:45| it's possible. Just my thoughts on it a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2265)|
| 0:37:50| that would have been decided. Six months ago whenever I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2270)|
| 0:37:53| began. But this is about six months that I mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2273)|
| 0:37:56| I've seen I mean it's it's a struggle to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2276)|
| 0:37:59| you know a business run especially when we're in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2279)|
| 0:38:01| midst of a economic downturn when I opened up was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2281)|
| 0:38:04| about the bottom of the barrel. And everything you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2284)|
| 0:38:09| It matters and make for me. To be able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2289)|
| 0:38:12| open up a bottle of beer and have it be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2292)|
| 0:38:15| worth about an hour's worth of work for me prepping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2295)|
| 0:38:18| Meals I mean it's it's an important aspect to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2298)|
| 0:38:21| it's not I don't want to be a bar that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2301)|
| 0:38:23| not what I'm looking for. Could I make payments toward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2303)|
| 0:38:26| in the future of course I could because I plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2306)|
| 0:38:28| on being successful. But I'd rather not at this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2308)|
| 0:38:33| in time yes I would rather not but if that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2313)|
| 0:38:35| what the way you guys put it to me I'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2315)|
| 0:38:36| do whatever you'd like I guess just my general concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2316)|
| 0:38:39| and I don't mean I'm talking about future people and.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2319)|
| 0:38:43| Somewhat similar circumstances where I mean. This might come out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2323)|
| 0:38:50| wrong and I'm trying to be polite don't get me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2330)|
| 0:38:52| wrong but if we do have a large influx of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2332)|
| 0:38:56| people you know looking for waivers with excuses or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2336)|
| 0:39:01| with reasons that are are adequate or maybe not as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2341)|
| 0:39:05| adequate and then all of a sudden you know there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2345)|
| 0:39:10| Implications the bottom lines for different city departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2350)|
| 0:39:13| I'm not saying you have to agree with that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2353)|
| 0:39:15| just. That's just kind of where I'm coming from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2355)|
| 0:39:17| sir no I understand completely what you're saying but I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2357)|
| 0:39:19| would hope that you don't get put in the situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2359)|
| 0:39:21| again that I hope that you're able to handle the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2361)|
| 0:39:24| situation in the future that really the big problem here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2364)|
| 0:39:26| is. There was just so much confusion from the beginning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2366)|
| 0:39:29| that I don't think really should have been there somehow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2369)|
| 0:39:32| this should have been. We should have known that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2372)|
| 0:39:34| answer to these questions the very first time I came| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2374)|
| 0:39:36| in. Resolving it now yeah I know. Councilman Holquist. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2376)|
| 0:39:45| don't know all the details but from what I know and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2385)|
| 0:39:47| from what I've heard so far I would definitely support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2387)|
| 0:39:50| the resolution. I will say that the use on review fee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2390)|
| 0:39:54| goes to the MPC. And there is a funding issue there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2394)|
| 0:39:58| and we're going to hear about it and. It goes beyond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2398)|
| 0:40:02| just. Offsetting a fee here and there which we. Basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2402)|
| 0:40:06| almost never do. But. You know this we need to keep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2406)|
| 0:40:11| in mind how we're going to fund the MPC. Which. Think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2411)|
| 0:40:16| they can make an argument that they're underfunded as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2416)|
| 0:40:18| it is. But. Having said that. This is an extraordinary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2418)|
| 0:40:23| situation and I will support the resolution. Councilman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2423)|
| 0:40:29| Booker. I too will support the resolution I've been to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2429)|
| 0:40:33| his place. More than once. And I know he has put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2433)|
| 0:40:37| a lot of resources into it. Not only has he done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2437)|
| 0:40:42| that with his restaurant. He has restored one of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2442)|
| 0:40:45| most historic. Houses in Mechanicsville. The counselor house. Where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2445)|
| 0:40:53| counselor who was a principal of Austin high school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2453)|
| 0:40:56| for over thirty years lived. And anytime a famous black| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2456)|
| 0:41:00| person like Booker T. Washington or anybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2460)|
| 0:41:03| came to this town. Who couldn't stay in the hotel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2463)|
| 0:41:06| stayed in that house. So I. I don't think. You| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2466)|
| 0:41:12| got the best from us the first time you were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2472)|
| 0:41:15| here and I would certainly. Hope that we can remedy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2475)|
| 0:41:18| that situation with this resolution. People. I'm sure we got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2478)|
| 0:41:25| those words. Thank you councilman Booker. My concern is. That| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2485)|
| 0:41:31| needs to be done immediately. Who are part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2491)|
| 0:41:37| Decision. Will not be on this council line and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2497)|
| 0:41:42| would love to see that rectified prior to. Our dismissal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2502)|
| 0:41:48| I'll move as quickly as. Thank you. May I say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2508)|
| 0:41:54| one more thing Mr chairman. As I look at Mechanicsville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2514)|
| 0:42:01| This is one of the very very few places in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2521)|
| 0:42:05| Mechanicsville. That would be able to sell beer. There are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2525)|
| 0:42:10| churches on almost every corner there are fifteen churches in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2530)|
| 0:42:14| Mechanicsville proper. And it is very difficult to find a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2534)|
| 0:42:18| place. Beyond three hundred feet of a church. To get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2538)|
| 0:42:23| a beer license and he certainly. Has a good spot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2543)|
| 0:42:27| where he can do it legally. I guess the first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2547)|
| 0:42:31| order of business is I move for a postponement. It's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2551)|
| 0:42:34| actually an extension of time extension of time. Second. Well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2554)|
| 0:42:38| how do you need to say how much. Second. Any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2558)|
| 0:42:43| further discussion. I can I can I can I can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2563)|
| 0:42:48| still. Push forward. Yeah. We shouldn't. All in favor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2568)|
| 0:42:55| say aye. Opposed no. We have it. Thank you. Thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2575)|
| 0:43:00| you. Councilman hall yes. Briefly before we recess. If someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2580)|
| 0:43:08| from the Metropolitan Drug Commission would like to come forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2588)|
| 0:43:10| I believe our executive director Catherine Branson is here. Each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2590)|
| 0:43:13| of the beer board member. Beer board members was provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2593)|
| 0:43:17| this evening. A packet. And this is similar or exactly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2597)|
| 0:43:22| what we give to our vendors when they receive a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2602)|
| 0:43:24| new beer permit. And you can see the buttons here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2604)|
| 0:43:26| and there's those lovely buttons. Ms. Branson would you like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2606)|
| 0:43:30| to tell us more about this packet. Just very briefly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2610)|
| 0:43:32| what you're getting is what Ms. Day provides to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2612)|
| 0:43:35| new permit holders. And what we've tried to assemble is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2615)|
| 0:43:39| just with restaurant input. Some materials that might help them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2619)|
| 0:43:44| in reducing underage sales that might help them with tips| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2624)|
| 0:43:47| on checking IDs and just preventing those sales. I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2627)|
| 0:43:52| at the last meeting you all had requested some information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2632)|
| 0:43:55| around strategies and tips that we could provide and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2635)|
| 0:43:57| wanted you to know that this is what we provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2637)|
| 0:44:00| very gratefully with our support from the city. The materials run| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2640)|
| 0:44:04| about seventeen dollars a bag so I will ask. That| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2644)|
| 0:44:08| when you are done looking at them if you would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2648)|
| 0:44:10| not like to hang them in your closet. If you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2650)|
| 0:44:13| would pass those to Ms. Day so that she could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2653)|
| 0:44:15| provide those to future new permit holders in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2655)|
| 0:44:19| And I you know I'll add if you have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2659)|
| 0:44:21| new permit holder in your district that you would like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2661)|
| 0:44:23| to personally deliver this to you know in addition I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2663)|
| 0:44:26| sure they can always use more buttons and more of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2666)|
| 0:44:28| the stickers. There's a couple of things I would like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2668)|
| 0:44:30| to highlight. One is is this board did ask for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2670)|
| 0:44:32| tips on responsible service and Officer Husky emailed to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2672)|
| 0:44:36| this list today and it's also in hard copy that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2676)|
| 0:44:38| separate from the beer board packet. So you know do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2678)|
| 0:44:41| take note of that because we struggled with how to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2681)|
| 0:44:43| advise permittees when they come in and they've had a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2683)|
| 0:44:47| violation and they're looking for ways in their point their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2687)|
| 0:44:51| remediation plan to do that. So these are some tips| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2691)|
| 0:44:53| they can use. In the packet are tips for vendors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2693)|
| 0:44:56| for checking fake IDs. The Metropolitan Drug Commission is going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2696)|
| 0:45:00| to be making an effort to provide more of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2700)|
| 0:45:02| materials in Spanish. So you can see these and if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2702)|
| 0:45:05| you don't speak Spanish you can see what it what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2705)|
| 0:45:08| it says in English here. And we have some posters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil091103?start=2708)|
