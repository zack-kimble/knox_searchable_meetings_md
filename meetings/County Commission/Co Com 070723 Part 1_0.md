| 0:02:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=124)|
| 0:02:06| Our first applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=126)|
| 0:02:09| This is for Tennis Partners, Inc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=129)|
| 0:02:10| Tennis Partners, Inc., doing business at Cedar Bluff Racket Club, 701 Racket Clubway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=130)|
| 0:02:15| on-premises formerly Cedar Bluff Racket Club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=135)|
| 0:02:19| Is anybody here representing Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=139)|
| 0:02:25| Mr. Chairman, I have spoken with them and they have decided to wait until next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=145)|
| 0:02:34| Their zoning is such that they can't, the law director's done a lot of hard work on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=154)|
| 0:02:39| this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=159)|
| 0:02:40| They can't find an exclusion where they can sell beer in that zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=160)|
| 0:02:44| And what they're going to do is, in January, go to the legislature and have one of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=164)|
| 0:02:48| private acts drawn, like boat docks and other places do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=168)|
| 0:02:54| We even tried to find one they could go under and you can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=174)|
| 0:02:57| So they're just out of the beer business for now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=177)|
| 0:03:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=180)|
| 0:03:01| And I don't know about, no, I'm not familiar, about the application fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=181)|
| 0:03:07| Can we just hold that or do they need to pay it again or do we need to give it back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=187)|
| 0:03:12| or what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=192)|
| 0:03:14| It's discretion of this board, whatever the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=194)|
| 0:03:16| Make a motion or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=196)|
| 0:03:17| I move we give it back to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=197)|
| 0:03:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=201)|

| 0:03:25| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=205)|
| 0:03:26| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=206)|
| 0:03:27| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=207)|
| 0:03:28| Just tell them they'll be deferred until January when they reapply, have them reapply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=208)|

| 0:03:54| Ladies, I know it's on the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=234)|
| 0:04:16| We did not get your addresses, so you might want to give the clerk your addresses before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=256)|
| 0:04:22| you leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=262)|

| 0:04:47| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=287)|
| 0:04:48| What we have is a request for a beer permit, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=288)|
| 0:04:49| This may be the third request for a permit at this location, in about the last six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=289)|
| 0:04:50| Mr. Beer, inspector, do you want to speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=290)|
| 0:04:51| It is the third application since January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=291)|
| 0:04:53| January the 1st of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=293)|
| 0:05:00| We have previously granted a beer permit at this location, haven't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=300)|
| 0:05:06| We've approved it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=306)|
| 0:05:07| He hadn't picked it up yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=307)|
| 0:05:08| He's been sick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=308)|
| 0:05:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=310)|
| 0:05:11| Is the person who has the beer permit now here today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=311)|
| 0:05:16| Have you seen him here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=316)|
| 0:05:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=317)|
| 0:05:18| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=318)|
| 0:05:19| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=319)|
| 0:05:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=326)|
| 0:05:28| Would you state your name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=328)|
| 0:05:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=330)|
| 0:05:31| Michael Sloots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=331)|
| 0:05:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=332)|
| 0:05:34| We have previously, as I understand it, this board has granted you a beer permit contingent upon getting some other information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=334)|
| 0:05:44| And from what I understand, that has been concluded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=344)|
| 0:05:47| And the beer permit is in the clerk's office ready for you to pick up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=347)|
| 0:05:52| Do you intend to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=352)|
| 0:05:54| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=354)|
| 0:05:55| I didn't know it was ready to pick up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=355)|
| 0:05:56| They said that they had to pass the final beer inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=356)|
| 0:05:59| And somewhere or another the keys got busted and locked and I couldn't get back into place, so I don't know what had happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=359)|
| 0:06:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=369)|
| 0:06:11| I have learned, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=371)|
| 0:06:14| and maybe you can shed some light on this, that there is a lawsuit pending involving this location?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=374)|
| 0:06:18| Well, there is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=378)|
| 0:06:19| See, the landlord, I paid him the first month's rent and then he wouldn't accept rent from me again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=379)|
| 0:06:26| He changed locks on the door, so I couldn't get in the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=386)|
| 0:06:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=391)|
| 0:06:32| And so you have filed a lawsuit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=392)|
| 0:06:33| Yes, I filed a lawsuit against him and these people here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=393)|
| 0:06:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=396)|
| 0:06:42| Well, the beer permit is in the clerk's office ready for you to pick up, which you may wish to do before you leave today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=402)|
| 0:06:54| Board, we have, as you've heard previously, granted a beer permit for this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=414)|
| 0:07:02| And until something occurs with that beer permit, whether it is surrendered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=422)|
| 0:07:09| or this gentleman, you know, is put out in the street and we're made aware of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=429)|
| 0:07:21| then I don't know that this committee, that this board should do anything with this latest beer application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=441)|
| 0:07:27| We can't have two at the same location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=447)|
| 0:07:29| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=449)|
| 0:07:30| Two different applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=450)|
| 0:07:33| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=453)|
| 0:07:36| Do either of the ladies here, do you all have any ownership in the premises?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=456)|
| 0:07:41| Let me speak to them, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=461)|
| 0:07:43| Ms. Lee and Ms. Allen, do either of you have any ownership interest in the premises?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=463)|
| 0:07:49| No, we just lease it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=469)|
| 0:07:51| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=471)|
| 0:07:52| We just lease it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=472)|
| 0:07:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=473)|
| 0:07:57| And who was just talking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=477)|
| 0:07:58| Ms. Lee, is that you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=478)|
| 0:08:00| No, Ms. Allen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=480)|
| 0:08:01| So Ms. Allen said that you just lease it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=481)|
| 0:08:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=483)|
| 0:08:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=484)|
| 0:08:08| When did you start leasing the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=488)|
| 0:08:11| Me and her about four weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=491)|
| 0:08:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=495)|
| 0:08:16| So you're aware that there's a lawsuit pending?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=496)|
| 0:08:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=498)|
| 0:08:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=500)|
| 0:08:23| Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=503)|
| 0:08:25| Yeah, on the last application, you were listed as a co-owner along with the gentleman that just spoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=505)|
| 0:08:33| Right, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=513)|
| 0:08:34| What occurred there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=514)|
| 0:08:37| He broke the lease pretty much, made a few phone calls, and Ralph got pretty upset and tore the lease up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=517)|
| 0:08:47| Who was it that tore the lease up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=527)|
| 0:08:49| Ralph, who owns the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=529)|
| 0:08:51| The owner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=531)|
| 0:08:52| Is Ralph here today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=532)|
| 0:08:54| No, he's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=534)|
| 0:08:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=536)|
| 0:09:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=541)|
| 0:09:02| Just for the record, on Pappy's, we have never approved that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=542)|
| 0:09:07| He did apply for a permit for occupancy and never called for any inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=547)|
| 0:09:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=561)|
| 0:09:22| So what you're saying is that the gentleman that just spoke, that his is still pending?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=562)|
| 0:09:27| Why is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=567)|
| 0:09:28| Because he's never called for any inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=568)|
| 0:09:31| He applied for his occupancy permit and then never called for any inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=571)|
| 0:09:36| And then when we finally did talk to, I think it was Mrs. Lee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=576)|
| 0:09:41| she said that he was no longer going to occupy that space and that I explained to her that an occupancy permit would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=581)|
| 0:09:48| required for her in order for her to occupy the space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=588)|
| 0:09:54| Come on up, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=594)|
| 0:10:06| Gentlemen, as I was explaining earlier, the landlord, Ralph Schultz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=606)|
| 0:10:13| Would you state your name for the record, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=613)|
| 0:10:14| Michael Schultz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=614)|
| 0:10:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=616)|
| 0:10:16| The landlord, Ralph Schultz, broke the key off in the front door and he changed the back door lock so I couldn't enter the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=616)|
| 0:10:24| building to get the final permits done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=624)|
| 0:10:29| And that's why I couldn't do anything because I don't know what steps to take on that because I got a year's lease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=629)|
| 0:10:36| and he wouldn't accept rent from me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=636)|
| 0:10:39| And he changed the locks so I couldn't get in the place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=639)|
| 0:10:46| Well, the fire marshal has yet to approve it because you haven't called the fire marshal and set up an appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=646)|
| 0:10:51| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=651)|
| 0:10:52| But I can't get in the entrance to the building because he's changed the locks on the doors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=652)|
| 0:10:58| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=658)|
| 0:11:02| The last thing this board needs to do is get in the middle of your all's lease dispute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=662)|
| 0:11:07| We've already granted one application and it's pending approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=667)|
| 0:11:15| What we may need to do is to wait until your lawsuit is concluded and see where everybody stands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=675)|
| 0:11:21| When is your next hearing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=681)|
| 0:11:23| The 13th of August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=683)|
| 0:11:25| August 13th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=685)|
| 0:11:26| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=686)|
| 0:11:29| That's what I would recommend that the board do is to hold this application in abeyance until, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=689)|
| 0:11:39| a title to lease the premises has been decided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=699)|
| 0:11:46| Mr. Cate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=706)|
| 0:11:47| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=707)|
| 0:11:49| Ms. Allen, are you all currently paying rent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=709)|
| 0:11:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=712)|
| 0:11:53| Do you have a lease?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=713)|
| 0:11:56| So you're on a month-to-month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=716)|
| 0:11:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=718)|
| 0:11:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=719)|
| 0:12:00| Can you one follow-up question on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=720)|
| 0:12:03| Can you come and go from the building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=723)|
| 0:12:04| You're allowed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=724)|
| 0:12:06| I mean, are you operating in the building now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=726)|
| 0:12:10| No, it's not open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=730)|
| 0:12:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=732)|
| 0:12:13| So there's nothing going on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=733)|
| 0:12:14| It is you don't have any business there that is occurring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=734)|
| 0:12:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=739)|
| 0:12:21| I don't have any business there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=741)|
| 0:12:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=746)|
| 0:12:27| Commissioner Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=747)|
| 0:12:28| I think we'll just make a motion we postpone this 30 days until this whole court thing is settled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=748)|
| 0:12:34| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=754)|
| 0:12:36| Would that give enough time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=756)|
| 0:12:38| If it gets heard on the 16th of August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=758)|
| 0:12:42| 13th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=762)|
| 0:12:43| 13th of August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=763)|
| 0:12:44| That should be enough time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=764)|
| 0:12:45| It was said to be heard the other day, as I understand it, and it was continued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=765)|
| 0:12:48| I was in the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=768)|
| 0:12:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=769)|
| 0:12:50| Okay, we have a first and second on the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=770)|
| 0:12:52| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=772)|
| 0:12:53| Mr. Cate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=773)|
| 0:12:56| I would just encourage you, Mr. Sheets, do whatever you can to get this worked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=776)|
| 0:12:59| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=779)|
| 0:13:00| Negotiate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=780)|
| 0:13:01| You don't necessarily have to go to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=781)|
| 0:13:02| Just try to get it worked out in 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=782)|
| 0:13:08| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=788)|
| 0:13:09| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=789)|
| 0:13:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=790)|
| 0:13:11| Opposed, like sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=791)|
| 0:13:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=792)|
| 0:13:14| Deferred for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=794)|
| 0:13:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=798)|
| 0:13:19| Item number seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=799)|
| 0:13:20| Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=800)|
| 0:13:22| Discussion of applications regarding LLCs and corporations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=802)|
| 0:13:27| We ought to take that off the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=807)|
| 0:13:30| My office, we are revamping our beer procedure, and hopefully we'll be back here to explain that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=810)|
| 0:13:38| within the next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=818)|
| 0:13:41| That and storm water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=821)|
| 0:13:43| Oh, that's just one of many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=823)|
| 0:13:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=826)|
| 0:13:47| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=827)|
| 0:13:48| Yes, I just want to thank our law director for sending out all of the notices about the new law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=828)|
| 0:13:51| I've heard from a couple of people who have said that it was very helpful, and it's good to be proactive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=831)|
| 0:13:56| and let our folks know that, indeed, the law had changed and the specifics of the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=836)|
| 0:14:00| So thank you, Mr. Law Director, for doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=840)|
| 0:14:02| I think it was something that was not necessary, but it was a very nice thing to do on behalf of the beer applicants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=842)|
| 0:14:08| or the persons who hold those beer permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=848)|
| 0:14:12| Anything else come before the beer board at this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=852)|
| 0:14:15| If not, I hear a motion to adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=855)|

| 0:16:47| Thank you, Commissioner Trammell and Commissioner Strickland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1007)|
| 0:16:50| We're on amendments to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1010)|
| 0:16:53| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1013)|
| 0:16:55| Commissioner Trammell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1015)|
| 0:16:57| Could we take 302 and move it to the front and then followed by 102, if we could, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1017)|
| 0:17:03| That will get the presentation from the vote and then get Senator Woodson out of here as quickly as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1023)|
| 0:17:10| She's got things to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1030)|
| 0:17:14| It's 302 is on page four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1034)|
| 0:17:17| He wants to take it off consent here at first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1037)|
| 0:17:20| And then if we can take a short recess and or to go out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1040)|
| 0:17:25| They've got the vote parked outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1045)|
| 0:17:26| The sheriff wanted everyone to come out and look at the new C-Ray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1046)|
| 0:17:30| And then if we'll come back in and we will hear Senator Woodson, which is on page three, 102.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1050)|
| 0:17:37| Could we also at that point hear 103, which is an honorary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1057)|
| 0:17:41| and several representatives of the Neighborhood Association are here to be so honored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1061)|
| 0:17:45| And we'll hear 103 after 102 without objections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1065)|
| 0:17:47| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1067)|
| 0:17:48| And 101, the Farragut High School rugby team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1068)|
| 0:17:54| We could hear that right after those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1074)|
| 0:17:56| And we'll hear it right after 103.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1076)|
| 0:17:57| That would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1077)|
| 0:18:00| Also, we need to add anything that needs to be added and withdraw anything that needs to be withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1080)|
| 0:18:08| Resolution 205, a grant for Knoxville Jazz, needs to be withdrawn because the grant has not been received yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1088)|
| 0:18:17| The grant contract has not been received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1097)|
| 0:18:22| So 205 is at the bottom of page three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1102)|
| 0:18:31| Mr. Chairman, members, I'm John King here to ask for postponement of a matter on the four o'clock agenda under zoning appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1111)|

| 0:18:48| I represent the applicant and also the other side has agreed to a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1128)|
| 0:18:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1135)|
| 0:18:56| If there's no objections from this commission, we'll postpone for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1136)|
| 0:18:59| Postpone for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1139)|

| 0:19:10| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1150)|
| 0:19:11| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1151)|
| 0:19:12| Mr. Chairman, did you, when you said added things to be added, I know it was passed out of Resolution 403,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1152)|
| 0:19:18| but it's not listed, but you meant to add that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1158)|
| 0:19:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1161)|
| 0:19:22| And Ordinance 102 is a revised one that was passed out, so it would be the revised one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1162)|
| 0:19:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1168)|
| 0:19:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1169)|
| 0:19:30| Do we have any other amendments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1170)|
| 0:19:33| Seeing none, the agenda is set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1173)|
| 0:19:35| Ms. Clark, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1175)|
| 0:19:40| 302.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1180)|
| 0:19:49| Consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1189)|
| 0:19:53| approving the acceptance of a donation from CRA of a CRA 220 SENDEC boat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1193)|
| 0:20:01| Intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1201)|
| 0:20:04| I move to approve 8-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1204)|
| 0:20:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1206)|
| 0:20:07| Finance Committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1207)|

| 0:20:14| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1214)|
| 0:20:15| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1215)|
| 0:20:16| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1216)|
| 0:20:17| And it's unanimous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1217)|
| 0:20:19| Now, I think the sheriff would like us to take probably a five-minute recess to go outside to the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1219)|
| 0:20:25| I think he's got the boat outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1225)|
| 0:20:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1231)|

| 0:29:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1740)|
| 0:29:05| All right, Clark, if we could hear 102.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1745)|
| 0:29:11| This is a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1751)|
| 0:29:14| honoring State Senator Jamie Woodson for helping change the basic education program, BEP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1754)|

| 0:29:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1771)|
| 0:29:32| Do we have a motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1772)|
| 0:29:33| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1773)|
| 0:29:34| Moved by Commissioner Trammell, seconded by Commissioner Leuthold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1774)|
| 0:29:37| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1777)|
| 0:29:38| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1778)|
| 0:29:39| Mr. Chairman, just a quick moment of discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1779)|
| 0:29:42| I would also like to thank Representative Tindall and Armstrong for voting for the funding mechanism that adds to the BEP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1782)|
| 0:29:49| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1789)|
| 0:29:52| And it passes unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1792)|
| 0:29:53| Clark, if you'd read it into the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1793)|
| 0:29:57| Whereas Senator Jamie Woodson received her undergraduate in law degree from the University of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1797)|
| 0:30:02| where she was selected as a torchbearer, the highest honor an undergraduate may receive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1802)|
| 0:30:08| And whereas Senator Woodson served six years in the State House of Representatives before being elected to the Senate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1808)|
| 0:30:14| in 2004 to represent the 6th Senatorial District in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1814)|
| 0:30:20| Whereas since taking office, Senator Woodson has served as Chairman of the Senate Education Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1820)|
| 0:30:26| and co-chair of the Select Oversight Education Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1826)|
| 0:30:30| And whereas due to her profound interest in improving Tennessee's education system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1830)|
| 0:30:35| Senator Woodson strove to improve the way Tennessee funds public schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1835)|
| 0:30:42| And whereas Governor Bredesen credits Senator Woodson with being instrumental in the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1842)|
| 0:30:47| of the changes to the basic education program, which provides the funding formula for Tennessee's school systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1847)|
| 0:30:55| Now, therefore, be it resolved by the Commission of Knox County as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1855)|
| 0:30:58| The Commission of Knox County, on behalf of all the citizens of Knox County, wishes to honor, recognize,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1858)|
| 0:31:04| and express its sincere appreciation to Knoxville State Senator Jamie Woodson for her dedicated service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1864)|
| 0:31:11| as State Senator and for its substantial effort and influence in revamping the BEP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1871)|
| 0:31:18| I'd like to recognize Commissioner Trammell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1878)|
| 0:31:20| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1880)|
| 0:31:22| Well, each and every one of us in an elected position can all say that we hope to make education better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1882)|
| 0:31:30| and our neighborhoods safer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1890)|
| 0:31:32| And I'm sure everyone that runs a campaign is going to have that as their platform,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1892)|
| 0:31:36| better educated children, safer neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1896)|
| 0:31:39| But I stand before you today with Senator Woodson showing you someone that has walked the walk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1899)|
| 0:31:44| talked the talk, and done the deed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1904)|
| 0:31:48| A few years ago, I had a chance to work with then-Representative Woodson out of Knox County on a criminal summons bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1908)|
| 0:31:55| And I can tell you, she definitely made our streets safer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1915)|
| 0:31:58| We were turning people loose, writing them tickets for crimes like aggravated assault, strong-arm robbery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1918)|
| 0:32:05| And when we went to Senator Woodson about this or then-Representative Woodson about this problem, she went to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1925)|
| 0:32:11| And it wasn't an easy task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1931)|
| 0:32:13| She battled the House majority leader.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1933)|
| 0:32:20| She battled Representative Joe Folks, the Democrat that chaired the Judicial Commission down there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1940)|
| 0:32:27| the judicial branch of government down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1947)|
| 0:32:31| And she went toe-to-toe, and she won.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1951)|
| 0:32:34| She made our streets safer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1954)|
| 0:32:35| She took bad guys off the street by doing away with the criminal summons bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1955)|
| 0:32:39| We're backed up on education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1959)|
| 0:32:41| Again, we look to Jamie Woodson for leadership in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1961)|
| 0:32:44| And again, she's proven her worth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1964)|
| 0:32:47| She brought $19 million more back to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1967)|
| 0:32:50| A lot of people will try to take credit for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1970)|
| 0:32:52| And there's probably some credit due, like Senator Burchett and Randy McNally and some that helped her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1972)|
| 0:32:58| And like my colleague, Commissioner Harmon, alluded to, there's a lot of people that deserve some credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1978)|
| 0:33:04| But this lady right here, she deserves the bulk of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1984)|
| 0:33:09| In my opinion, she's not got what she deserves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1989)|
| 0:33:11| And this is just a small way that I think we can give back to her for all she's done for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1991)|
| 0:33:16| Senator Woodson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=1996)|
| 0:33:39| Commissioner Trammell, thank you so very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2019)|
| 0:33:43| To our leadership in county government, those are incredibly kind words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2023)|
| 0:33:48| and the resolution was very, very nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2028)|
| 0:33:52| There are so many folks who made possible what happened this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2032)|
| 0:33:56| and I'm honored to be a part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2036)|
| 0:33:59| The local community here in Knox County, as your state delegation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2039)|
| 0:34:06| recognized the inequity in our current funding formula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2046)|
| 0:34:10| We knew that it wasn't about solely the children of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2050)|
| 0:34:15| that we needed more money in just for the sake of having more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2055)|
| 0:34:19| But we knew that there was a fundamental unfairness in the formula| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2059)|
| 0:34:22| that treated the students of our community in an unfair fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2062)|
| 0:34:27| And so we fought for fairness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2067)|
| 0:34:29| We fought very hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2069)|
| 0:34:31| There was an absolutely unified and consistent message here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2071)|
| 0:34:35| in our local community, and it spread.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2075)|
| 0:34:38| And it was one that was spread over several, several years of challenge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2078)|
| 0:34:42| and hopefully thoughtful debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2082)|
| 0:34:45| And this was a good year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2085)|
| 0:34:47| It was when the equity and fairness came back to our funding formula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2087)|
| 0:34:52| And what I'm so very hopeful for is that it will be a point in our state's history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2092)|
| 0:34:57| where we can always, as you know, as you decide on your budgets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2097)|
| 0:35:02| you weigh the importance of certain projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2102)|
| 0:35:05| you prioritize, and we'll always have our budget to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2105)|
| 0:35:09| But we have a fair funding mechanism now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2109)|
| 0:35:12| and we can begin this conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2112)|
| 0:35:14| and frankly the conversation that I'd far rather have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2114)|
| 0:35:17| which is how do we prepare the students and citizens of our state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2117)|
| 0:35:21| for this global economy and for success in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2121)|
| 0:35:24| And that's going to be the conversation that you'll be hearing about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2124)|
| 0:35:27| It's so refreshing to have such a community partnership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2127)|
| 0:35:31| with our local community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2131)|
| 0:35:34| Commissioner Trammell, thank you so much for your kind words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2134)|
| 0:35:37| And Mayor Ragsdale, and particularly Allison Wagley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2137)|
| 0:35:40| who has been working so diligently to keep us informed on all the issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2140)|
| 0:35:45| on the state level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2145)|
| 0:35:47| I'm truly humbled that you all would recognize me in this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2147)|
| 0:35:51| It is such a blessing and a privilege to serve this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2151)|
| 0:35:54| And thank you all so much for being such a unified voice at the local level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2154)|
| 0:35:59| so that we could carry that torch of fairness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2159)|
| 0:36:01| And this year it will be $19 million, as you all know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2161)|
| 0:36:04| It will be hopefully the beginning of three years of phase in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2164)|
| 0:36:07| Good Lord willing, the economy performs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2167)|
| 0:36:09| But we do have our priorities very straight in Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2169)|
| 0:36:12| and that's keeping improving public education number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2172)|
| 0:36:15| And we're going to continue to fight for that fairness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2175)|
| 0:36:17| and also continue to ask that question about how we can better prepare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2177)|
| 0:36:21| our students for success in this amazing world that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2181)|
| 0:36:24| So thank you all so very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2184)|
| 0:36:26| I'm very, very humbled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2186)|
| 0:36:27| Thank you, Senator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2187)|
| 0:36:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2191)|
| 0:36:36| Mr. Chairman, real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2196)|
| 0:36:38| Commissioner Trammell, did you mention that she was torchbearer at University of Tennessee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2198)|
| 0:36:42| I think you mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2202)|
| 0:36:44| That's the top ten, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2204)|
| 0:36:46| And I think our mayor, I believe he was torchbearer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2206)|
| 0:36:48| I think you might be looking at your next mayor, if that's the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2208)|
| 0:36:58| Clerk, 103.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2218)|
| 0:37:04| This is a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2224)|
| 0:37:07| honoring the Oakwood Lincoln Park Neighborhood Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2227)|
| 0:37:11| as well as its leadership and volunteers for their exceptional contributions to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2231)|
| 0:37:18| Intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2238)|
| 0:37:19| Intergovernmental vote at 8001 to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2239)|
| 0:37:23| Finance committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2243)|
| 0:37:27| We've got a motion made by Commissioner Pinkston, seconded by Commissioner Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2247)|
| 0:37:33| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2253)|
| 0:37:34| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2254)|
| 0:37:35| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2255)|
| 0:37:36| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2256)|
| 0:37:37| And it's unanimous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2257)|
| 0:37:38| Clerk, if you'd read it into the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2258)|
| 0:37:40| Whereas Dr. Paul Kelly recently stepped aside as president of the Oakwood Lincoln Park Neighborhood Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2260)|
| 0:37:47| that's OLPNA, after dedicated and creative leadership of that organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2267)|
| 0:37:54| whereas OLPNA recently has made several notable accomplishments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2274)|
| 0:37:57| including an infill housing overlay to ensure the architecture of new construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2277)|
| 0:38:04| is consistent with existing structures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2284)|
| 0:38:07| a new sidewalk across from Fulton High School for the students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2287)|
| 0:38:11| and new landscaping at the community meeting place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2291)|
| 0:38:16| Whereas OLPNA has a traffic calming plan that includes reduced speed limits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2296)|
| 0:38:22| to 25 miles per hour throughout the residential area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2302)|
| 0:38:25| and a plan for streets around Christenbury Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2305)|
| 0:38:29| And whereas OLPNA provides monthly programs of interest to the members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2309)|
| 0:38:33| a quarterly newsletter, a community directory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2313)|
| 0:38:36| an annual work plan to promote the interest of the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2316)|
| 0:38:40| and five promotional teams, development, health, education, and recreation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2320)|
| 0:38:47| residential and business, historic preservation and beautification, environment and safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2327)|
| 0:38:53| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2333)|
| 0:38:58| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2338)|
| 0:39:00| I'll be very brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2340)|
| 0:39:01| I can't help being short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2341)|
| 0:39:03| But OLPNA is one of the many fine neighborhood associations in the second district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2343)|
| 0:39:11| And you can't expect a better group when you go visit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2351)|
| 0:39:16| They always have something going on in their neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2356)|
| 0:39:18| They're open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2358)|
| 0:39:19| They're democratic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2359)|
| 0:39:20| They have frequent meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2360)|
| 0:39:22| And Paul Kelly has contributed immensely to that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2362)|
| 0:39:25| And when the time came, he decided to step aside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2365)|
| 0:39:28| And many of the new people who are coming up have big shoes to fill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2368)|
| 0:39:31| And I understand the mayor is sort of piling on to this resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2371)|
| 0:39:34| which I hardly concur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2374)|
| 0:39:36| I don't want to spoil your surprise, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2376)|
| 0:39:39| I think he's adding a proclamation because not only is it about OLPNA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2379)|
| 0:39:43| but it's also about Dr. Paul Kelly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2383)|
| 0:39:45| And I believe he's declaring today Paul and Norma Kelly Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2385)|
| 0:39:48| Muchly, greatly deserved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2388)|
| 0:39:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2392)|
| 0:39:53| Commissioner Bowles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2393)|
| 0:39:56| I would just like to second Commissioner Harmon and what he said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2396)|
| 0:40:00| And also Paul Kelly is a leader among men in Knoxville and Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2400)|
| 0:40:06| and the influence he's had on the children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2406)|
| 0:40:09| And this area and the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2409)|
| 0:40:11| And we just appreciate speaking for all the people of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2411)|
| 0:40:14| and Knox County what you've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2414)|
| 0:40:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2416)|
| 0:40:19| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2419)|
| 0:40:20| But before I accept this resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2420)|
| 0:40:22| I should inquire whether our new president is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2422)|
| 0:40:25| Is Ed Eckenrod here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2425)|
| 0:40:27| If he is, he should come down and accept the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2427)|
| 0:40:32| Well, let me just say that I have enjoyed the four years that I was president.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2432)|
| 0:40:39| And I do thank you and all of those who have had a part of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2439)|
| 0:40:44| But now, Commissioner Harmon, I think I told you not to do one of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2444)|
| 0:40:49| I didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2449)|
| 0:40:50| The mayor did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2450)|
| 0:40:51| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2451)|
| 0:40:53| Then I'll have to take it out on the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2453)|
| 0:40:56| Thank you so very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2456)|
| 0:40:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2458)|
| 0:41:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2467)|
| 0:41:08| Clerk 101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2468)|
| 0:41:09| This is a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2469)|
| 0:41:12| honoring the Farragut High School rugby team for winning the boys' plate division title| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2472)|

| 0:41:26| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2486)|
| 0:41:27| We voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2487)|
| 0:41:28| What did we vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2488)|

| 0:41:48| I do want to disclose, though, that my son is on the rugby team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2508)|
| 0:41:51| Unfortunately, he didn't get to play in the championship game because he was injured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2511)|
| 0:41:56| But he was there to root him on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2516)|
| 0:42:00| I may be one of the safer commissioners here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2520)|
| 0:42:03| I've got some of the strongest young men behind me that you can imagine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2523)|
| 0:42:09| I don't know how much you know about rugby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2529)|
| 0:42:11| I've been learning the sport myself since my son has decided to pick it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2531)|
| 0:42:17| And these guys right here may be some of the toughest athletes in all of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2537)|
| 0:42:22| They play football without pads or helmets, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2542)|
| 0:42:28| They've been working out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2548)|
| 0:42:29| I know that they're working out right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2549)|
| 0:42:32| They've got workouts at 4 o'clock this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2552)|
| 0:42:36| They're very dedicated athletes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2556)|
| 0:42:38| They're very serious about their sport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2558)|
| 0:42:41| I think it's an up-and-coming sport here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2561)|
| 0:42:44| And their coach here is a very dedicated teacher at Farragut High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2564)|
| 0:42:51| He's a math teacher there, teaches honors math there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2571)|
| 0:42:57| My son has had him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2577)|
| 0:42:58| And he just brags about what a great teacher he is along with being a coach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2578)|
| 0:43:03| and can never say enough about what an influence a great teacher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2583)|
| 0:43:11| and coach can have on our society and our young men and women.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2591)|
| 0:43:15| We don't have a women's rugby team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2595)|
| 0:43:17| But, Coach, if you could come up here and we can present you with this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2597)|
| 0:43:26| I believe the mayor has one for you as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2606)|
| 0:43:29| And if you would like to say a few words about your team and their accomplishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2609)|
| 0:43:36| If we can give them a round of applause, it would be greatly appreciated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2616)|

| 0:44:14| We spend a lot of time together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2654)|
| 0:44:16| And if not for their dedication to our program, their dedication to each other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2656)|
| 0:44:23| their teammates, the dedication of their parents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2663)|
| 0:44:27| we would not have had the success that we had this season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=2667)|

| 0:51:44| The first one is Stone Tower Drive and the second one is Weatherstone Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3104)|
| 0:51:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3111)|
| 0:51:52| One item we need to correct is Resolution 908, dealing with the property tax freeze.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3112)|
| 0:51:59| I think we need three commissioners to be on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3119)|
| 0:52:01| I think Commissioner Craig Luthold has said he would like to be on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3121)|
| 0:52:04| No, that's not what my light's on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3124)|
| 0:52:06| My light was on to point that out, that we needed to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3126)|
| 0:52:10| I think it would be appropriate for three other commissioners to be on that committee, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3130)|
| 0:52:14| Would you like to be on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3134)|
| 0:52:15| I'd nominate you if you want to be on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3135)|
| 0:52:18| You're dealing with that on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3138)|
| 0:52:20| Well, I know it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3140)|
| 0:52:23| I will serve at the pleasure of this commission, but, you know, that's not what I was trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3143)|
| 0:52:30| So any three commissioners that would like to serve on it, they'd be happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3150)|
| 0:52:33| But if they want me on it, then I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3153)|
| 0:52:35| I'd like to put Craig Luthold's name in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3155)|
| 0:52:39| Of course, we will need two other names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3159)|
| 0:52:41| Mr. Chairman, I'll do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3161)|
| 0:52:43| Commissioner Smith and Commissioner Cate had said outside that he'd like to serve on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3163)|
| 0:52:49| So if we can add those names without objections from the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3169)|
| 0:52:52| or if we need to add some more names and vote on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3172)|
| 0:52:56| I do want to remember to disclose that I do work for the trustee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3176)|
| 0:52:59| You work for who?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3179)|
| 0:53:00| Knox County trustee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3180)|
| 0:53:02| I don't believe that qualifies as a conflict, does it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3182)|
| 0:53:05| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3185)|
| 0:53:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3186)|
| 0:53:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3188)|
| 0:53:09| If those names are satisfactory with the commission, then we can vote the whole consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3189)|
| 0:53:15| So do I have a motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3195)|
| 0:53:18| Motion made by Commissioner Trammell, seconded by Commissioner Ivan Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3198)|

| 0:53:26| Approval of the previous meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3206)|
| 0:53:28| Mr. Chairman, that was to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3208)|
| 0:53:29| I think we still have to approve the entire consent agenda, wasn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3209)|
| 0:53:35| To amend it by adding those three names and now we have to approve the entire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3215)|
| 0:53:37| Well, I thought we could do it all at once, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3217)|
| 0:53:40| Mr. Law Director, or do we take it separate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3220)|
| 0:53:43| You can take it separate if you like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3223)|
| 0:53:45| I mean, it's whatever the wish of this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3225)|
| 0:53:48| I thought procedurally it was required, but if you don't think it is, it's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3228)|
| 0:53:52| Well, we can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3232)|
| 0:53:53| So we amended the consent agenda with the three names of the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3233)|
| 0:53:57| so now we're ready to approve the consent agenda as its entirety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3237)|

| 0:56:04| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3364)|

| 0:56:22| Now we're on discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3382)|
| 0:56:23| Commissioner Strickland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3383)|
| 0:56:26| This goes out to my fellow colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3386)|
| 0:56:28| People in finance heard me last Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3388)|
| 0:56:32| This property, which we're proposing to have a passive park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3392)|
| 0:56:37| this is not something that just come up in the past year or two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3397)|
| 0:56:41| or when the library became a part of a library system, the new one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3401)|
| 0:56:47| We've been working on this project for, I know, 11 years in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3407)|
| 0:56:50| trying to get this property fixed up because we believe that it was blighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3410)|
| 0:56:58| The neighbors have been protesting this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3418)|
| 0:57:04| They've had citations written on this property for years and years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3424)|
| 0:57:08| And I found out that from some people in the town hall eastern areas around this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3428)|
| 0:57:14| they've been working on it for 17 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3434)|
| 0:57:17| This property has nothing to do with the library in essence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3437)|
| 0:57:20| It's two separate projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3440)|
| 0:57:23| The second phase of the project I've heard a lot of you talk about is the lounge next to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3443)|
| 0:57:29| The city has committed $150,000 to put in to buy the lounge to fulfill this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3449)|
| 0:57:41| The church has committed to doing the demolition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3461)|
| 0:57:44| and that's what we always talk about, having several entities in one project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3464)|
| 0:57:52| The city will maintain the project as far as cutting grass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3472)|
| 0:57:57| The county said that they will build the project at a cheaper rate than what we will go out and construct it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3477)|
| 0:58:05| I'm for it, and I'm asking you as my fellow colleagues to look at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3485)|
| 0:58:09| and look at the wishes of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3489)|
| 0:58:13| The money is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3493)|
| 0:58:14| It has been appropriated from the city and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3494)|
| 0:58:17| And the only thing that we need to do now is to vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3497)|
| 0:58:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3503)|
| 0:58:24| We have a couple of people who would like to speak on it, if we'd like to hear them at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3504)|
| 0:58:28| Sharon Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3508)|

| 0:58:56| Did you know that there's 16, and it goes from Park City all the way over to Emlyn Boulevard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3536)|
| 0:59:04| and all of those, even the folks, the nice, educated, well-informed folks that I spoke with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3544)|
| 0:59:11| and enjoy talking to down in the Five Points area, they don't really have a problem with this issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3551)|
| 0:59:20| of where their library is, if you're considering that as a negative today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3560)|
| 0:59:26| I feel like, Tank, this project, this purchase of this property is a separate issue from the library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3566)|
| 0:59:35| So whatever happens there, we still want this area cleaned up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3575)|
| 0:59:41| The persons that frequent that sometimes, especially in the evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3581)|
| 0:59:45| is not representative of the community, the way this property looks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3585)|
| 0:59:50| And we have been fighting this for 17 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3590)|
| 0:59:53| We have made some progress, but we need your help to clean this up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3593)|
| 0:59:58| make a nice little green park there where families can come, maybe have a swing or two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3598)|
| 1:00:04| you know, have a little grass between their toes and enjoy this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3604)|
| 1:00:08| So we do appreciate your support of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3608)|
| 1:00:12| And the city is committed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3612)|
| 1:00:14| The neighborhood is committed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3614)|
| 1:00:16| The local businesses and churches are committed to this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3616)|
| 1:00:20| And I'd like to recognize some of the neighbors that have taken off from their jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3620)|
| 1:00:25| their places of employment today, to come down here in the middle of the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3625)|
| 1:00:31| And I'd like for those members to stand up today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3631)|
| 1:00:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3638)|
| 1:00:45| These folks are interested in this project, and I hope that you will vote yes for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3645)|
| 1:00:50| Is there any questions that I can answer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3650)|
| 1:00:52| I've done my homework.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3652)|
| 1:00:55| I'd like to ask one question, if you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3655)|
| 1:00:57| It's Commissioner Harmon over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3657)|
| 1:00:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3658)|
| 1:00:59| Can you give this commission a reasonable assurance or perhaps the city or someone that there won't be a hitch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3659)|
| 1:01:04| with the Lariat Lounge property and that there won't be a problem if we approve the purchase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3664)|
| 1:01:10| that this will all come together?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3670)|
| 1:01:12| Well, I've been told.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3672)|
| 1:01:14| I mean, Ty can tell you more about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3674)|
| 1:01:15| He's been told from the city that they are committed to this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3675)|
| 1:01:20| and the Lariat Lounge, is that correct, Mr. Strickland?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3680)|
| 1:01:23| One hundred and fifty thousand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3683)|
| 1:01:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3685)|
| 1:01:27| So how does that answer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3687)|
| 1:01:30| Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3690)|
| 1:01:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3691)|
| 1:01:32| Commissioner Moore, first of all, I think the city has probably let these people down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3692)|
| 1:01:35| They've had this problem for years about the blighted out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3695)|
| 1:01:38| But I'm for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3698)|
| 1:01:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3700)|
| 1:01:42| I voted against it in intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3702)|
| 1:01:46| I mean, in finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3706)|
| 1:01:47| But here's what I would like to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3707)|
| 1:01:48| I want to be sure that the city is committed to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3708)|
| 1:01:52| And I would like to make us buying it contingent upon the city purchasing the Lariat Lounge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3712)|
| 1:01:57| That suits me just fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3717)|
| 1:01:59| We want both pieces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3719)|
| 1:02:01| And please don't put me off for 30 days, 120.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3721)|
| 1:02:04| We want both pieces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3724)|
| 1:02:05| Thank you, Mr. Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3725)|
| 1:02:06| I understand, Mr. Strickland, that you all have been looking at it for 11 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3726)|
| 1:02:10| We haven't gotten this far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3730)|
| 1:02:11| Well, I've been with the city 11 years, and I know that's one of the first things I had to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3731)|
| 1:02:16| I think then they ought to come forward and stand up, buy this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3736)|
| 1:02:21| and us buying the other property would be contingent on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3741)|
| 1:02:24| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3744)|
| 1:02:27| If that's okay with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3747)|
| 1:02:30| It would suit the neighborhood, both pieces of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3750)|
| 1:02:34| Maybe the mayor can speak on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3754)|
| 1:02:36| And I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3756)|
| 1:02:37| Mike, maybe you can talk about the commitment from the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3757)|
| 1:02:46| Commissioner Strickland, Mayor Haslam, and I think Mr. Becker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3766)|
| 1:02:49| and several of the council people here earlier have told me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3769)|
| 1:02:53| and I trust them completely, that they're going to invest $150,000 in this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3773)|
| 1:02:57| It's something that we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3777)|
| 1:02:59| And as far as the library, that library is going no place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3779)|
| 1:03:02| We had two neighborhood nights at the old library where this was the overwhelming pick of the people in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3782)|
| 1:03:09| We had a public hearing on it, so you had three opportunities to voice your opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3789)|
| 1:03:13| This library has had overwhelming success, and it's because of many of the people here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3793)|
| 1:03:17| and their friends and neighbors and children who have supported it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3797)|
| 1:03:20| And it's a darn good pick of a library, and it's working exceptionally well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3800)|
| 1:03:24| So the idea that the library might go anywhere is completely false.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3804)|
| 1:03:27| It's staying exactly where it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3807)|
| 1:03:29| And if you want to discuss the bogus suit that was filed by some character in Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3809)|
| 1:03:33| I think Mr. Owens can address that quite appropriately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3813)|
| 1:03:35| And I'm not so sure he didn't wander from the terms I just used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3815)|
| 1:03:38| So we want to clean this area up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3818)|
| 1:03:41| Chill Howie Hills Baptist Church across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3821)|
| 1:03:43| I know Pastor Crisp is here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3823)|
| 1:03:45| They've made a substantial investment in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3825)|
| 1:03:48| Other neighbors and businesses have made substantial investments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3828)|
| 1:03:51| When we relocated the health department, we moved that to the historic Hardy buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3831)|
| 1:03:55| in an area where it can better serve citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3835)|
| 1:03:57| So this whole process, I think, has been a win-win for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3837)|
| 1:04:00| So I'm convinced the city has $150,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3840)|
| 1:04:04| They're going to invest as well as maintain the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3844)|
| 1:04:06| And however you want to structure it is obviously up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3846)|
| 1:04:09| But I want us to go ahead and move forward with this because I think the citizens deserve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3849)|
| 1:04:12| They've waited a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3852)|
| 1:04:14| We've put it in our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3854)|
| 1:04:15| We've worked with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3855)|
| 1:04:16| They've been incredibly supportive of this whole process and the library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3856)|
| 1:04:19| And for that, I'm very grateful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3859)|
| 1:04:20| And now I think the ball is in our court to uphold our end of the deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3860)|
| 1:04:32| Commissioner Ballard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3872)|
| 1:04:34| Yes, I'd like to go on record in support of Tank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3874)|
| 1:04:38| Many of the people that's here today live in the 8th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3878)|
| 1:04:42| The owners live in the 8th District, and I've been contacted by numerous people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3882)|
| 1:04:46| And I well know this area, the old Burlington area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3886)|
| 1:04:49| You know, you had Ruby's out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3889)|
| 1:04:51| You had barber shops, Nancy Lynn's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3891)|
| 1:04:53| And, you know, I think this would be a great deal to help revitalize this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3893)|
| 1:04:58| Chihuahua Church across from it there has a school for children now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3898)|
| 1:05:03| And they would like to see this cleaned up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3903)|
| 1:05:07| And I would like to see it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3907)|
| 1:05:09| And that would go forward on this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3909)|
| 1:05:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3911)|
| 1:05:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3912)|
| 1:05:13| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3913)|
| 1:05:14| Ms. Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3914)|
| 1:05:16| Ms. Davis, up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3916)|
| 1:05:18| Is there somebody here from the church or somebody who is going to tear this down or both buildings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3918)|
| 1:05:24| Is that individual here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3924)|
| 1:05:25| I don't know if that individual is here or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3925)|
| 1:05:27| but there is another gentleman here that would like to speak to you, a businessman in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3927)|
| 1:05:32| I want to know what that is going to save taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3932)|
| 1:05:34| I think that needs to be brought out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3934)|
| 1:05:36| As far as the cost of tearing down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3936)|
| 1:05:37| How much do you estimate that that's going to save Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3937)|
| 1:05:40| That needs to be brought out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3940)|
| 1:05:42| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3942)|
| 1:05:43| And as far as the construction cost of tearing that down, I've not run those figures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3943)|
| 1:05:47| I know that we do have a commitment, and I believe from a good source, that we'll tear it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3947)|
| 1:05:52| Is there any figures that you have for me, Pastor Chris?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3952)|
| 1:06:05| I'm Tony Crisp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3965)|
| 1:06:06| I'm a senior pastor at Chilliawa Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3966)|
| 1:06:08| And, Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3968)|
| 1:06:09| Excuse me a minute, Tony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3969)|
| 1:06:11| Sir, you with the signs, this is free speech.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3971)|
| 1:06:15| We understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3975)|
| 1:06:17| This disrespectful for those people that can't see this gentleman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3977)|
| 1:06:21| If you want to take them back there in the back, be respectful of the people behind you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3981)|
| 1:06:29| I'm sorry, Pastor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3989)|
| 1:06:31| Mr. Smith, I spoke with a man who is a very reputable excavating company owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=3991)|
| 1:06:40| and he said that whatever it took, he was willing to tear that down, excavate it, and haul it off for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4000)|
| 1:06:50| And he made that commitment to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4010)|
| 1:06:52| It's not in writing, but he's a man of his word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4012)|
| 1:06:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4015)|
| 1:06:57| Mr. Kaywood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4017)|
| 1:06:58| Somewhere between $30,000 and $40,000 is what it's estimated at as far as the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4018)|
| 1:07:03| That's awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4023)|
| 1:07:07| My only concern about this project is the price of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4027)|
| 1:07:12| If I understand this correctly, we will own less than half an acre with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4032)|
| 1:07:19| And we're purchasing it for $125,000, $129,000, something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4039)|
| 1:07:25| And I believe it's on the tax records at less than $100,000, $92,000 or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4045)|
| 1:07:32| And the taxes are going down on it, so it seems to be depreciating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4052)|
| 1:07:36| And I'm just wondering if we've got a good price on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4056)|
| 1:07:42| We're paying exactly what it appraised for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4062)|
| 1:07:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4076)|
| 1:07:57| Commissioner Bolus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4077)|
| 1:07:58| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4078)|
| 1:08:00| I would just like to say I've received a number of calls on this issue in the last week or so, all to the positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4080)|
| 1:08:08| I think this speaks volumes that these people are here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4088)|
| 1:08:11| And I would just like to ask the commission today's support and what Commissioner Strickland said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4091)|
| 1:08:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4099)|
| 1:08:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4101)|
| 1:08:22| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4102)|
| 1:08:23| I'd just like to say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4103)|
| 1:08:26| I don't think that we need people in the community paying to tear that building down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4106)|
| 1:08:30| Now, if the church can get it done, that's fine for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4110)|
| 1:08:33| But if we go so far as to purchase this property, these are taxpayers out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4113)|
| 1:08:37| We need to take the responsibility to clean it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4117)|
| 1:08:39| We have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4119)|
| 1:08:40| But the only thing I'm saying is, and I'm going to vote to buy this property, contingent, like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4120)|
| 1:08:46| with the city buying the Lariat Lounge, but we do not need a park next to a bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4126)|
| 1:08:51| So that's all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4131)|
| 1:08:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4134)|
| 1:08:55| And we have Gerald Clark signed up and wanted to speak on 204.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4135)|
| 1:08:58| Is Gerald still here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4138)|
| 1:09:21| Mr. Clark, if you'll give your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4161)|
| 1:09:23| My name is Gerald Deason Daniel, and the line is Den Clark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4163)|
| 1:09:27| I live at 2510 Miss Ellie Drive, Knoxville 10, 37921.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4167)|
| 1:09:34| I think there's a little confusion on just where that I was to speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4174)|
| 1:09:39| It is unusual that I lived in Holston Hills for a little over 15 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4179)|
| 1:09:46| so I have tons of friends out that way and know quite a bit about that whole community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4186)|
| 1:09:55| About 13, 14 years ago, I moved back on the west side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4195)|
| 1:10:00| I just have been following different things that have been going on with our county government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4200)|
| 1:10:09| and we all just, I'm sure, cringe when we have so many things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4209)|
| 1:10:15| One thing seems to pile kindly on the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4215)|
| 1:10:19| And I would just say that I'm a disabled veteran.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4219)|
| 1:10:26| I'm an amputee of World War II.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4226)|
| 1:10:29| I lost my right leg in the war.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4229)|
| 1:10:32| I don't like to mention that without saying I wore an artificial limb successfully for almost 60 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4232)|
| 1:10:41| so I'm a very fortunate individual and American citizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4241)|
| 1:10:49| Really, I just wanted to address that this area of our community development, community services that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4249)|
| 1:11:01| and I wanted to address that whole area because we have a little lady by the name of Cynthia Finch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4261)|
| 1:11:11| And this little lady was our go-to person in Mayor Ragsdale's office for our East Tennessee State Veterans Nursing Home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4271)|
| 1:11:21| which I call the Knox County State Veterans Nursing Home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4281)|
| 1:11:26| And there's just numbers of things that have been going and coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4286)|
| 1:11:33| I realize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4293)|
| 1:11:35| But this individual has been so tremendous in working with us for a period of something over now close to 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4295)|
| 1:11:49| And so I just simply am here today to say that she's very near and very dear to a host of our not only Knox County veterans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4309)|
| 1:12:04| but our area veterans in this whole area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4324)|
| 1:12:08| I happen to be the commander of the United Veterans of East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4328)|
| 1:12:14| Some 11 years ago, we formed a state-chartered, nonprofit, nonpartisan veterans organization to get action on the third,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4334)|
| 1:12:27| our East Tennessee State Veterans Nursing Home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4347)|
| 1:12:31| We were pushed off of this for close to about six or seven years before we got action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4351)|
| 1:12:41| I will close by saying that I lived out there in that neighborhood, like I say, for about 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4361)|
| 1:12:52| I think it's a great move of our county and the county commission to do what they're doing there for that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4372)|
| 1:13:01| I think it's obvious to the great number that we're here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4381)|
| 1:13:05| We really want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4385)|
| 1:13:08| Maybe I wasn't careful enough on getting on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4388)|
| 1:13:14| Probably I wouldn't have got on it at all if I hadn't been able to get on at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4394)|
| 1:13:19| But please, let's work together on the things for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4399)|
| 1:13:26| We have made great, tremendous progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4406)|
| 1:13:31| And so I just tell you, Ms. Cynthia Finch and all of her staff and others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4411)|
| 1:13:38| from the mayor to the everlasting employee in Knox County that I have been related to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4418)|
| 1:13:44| and the other veterans, I believe, say the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4424)|
| 1:13:47| We have nothing but great respect for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4427)|
| 1:13:51| And mistakes will be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4431)|
| 1:13:54| I'd like for anyone who hasn't made a mistake to stand up and hold their hand real high| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4434)|
| 1:14:01| because back when I was very young, someone said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4441)|
| 1:14:06| the person that never made a mistake never did anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4446)|
| 1:14:11| And so that needs to come around, does it not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4451)|
| 1:14:15| I'll close by saying this county commission had a great deal to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4455)|
| 1:14:20| with us getting this beautiful nursing facility here in our area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4460)|
| 1:14:28| This county commission, all 19 of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4468)|
| 1:14:32| voted yea to provide 14.2 acres of suitable property out there in the Westbridge Business Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4472)|
| 1:14:42| for a state veterans nursing home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4482)|
| 1:14:46| And it's the most beautiful one that anybody has been able to find out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4486)|
| 1:14:52| I really think our state government, after ten years, got really guilty about this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4492)|
| 1:14:57| And they really built a tremendous nursing home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4497)|
| 1:15:01| If you haven't seen it, please see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4501)|
| 1:15:04| I really appreciate our county and our county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4504)|
| 1:15:09| They were a big, big push that joined with Mayor Ragsdale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4509)|
| 1:15:13| and this nursing home being in East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4513)|
| 1:15:16| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4516)|
| 1:15:18| Thank you, Mr. Clark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4518)|
| 1:15:22| We have one other speaker, William Rebold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4522)|
| 1:15:32| Could you give your name and address for the record, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4532)|
| 1:15:35| Of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4535)|
| 1:15:36| My name is William Rebold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4536)|
| 1:15:37| My address is 1770 Breezy Point Lane, Dandridge, Tennessee, 37725.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4537)|
| 1:15:43| I'd like to just really inform the commission of something they may not be aware of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4543)|
| 1:15:49| and that is the seven and a half acres adjacent to Chilhowee Hills Baptist Church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4549)|
| 1:15:54| which was the old holiday inn originally, and in more recent years, the family inn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4554)|
| 1:15:59| And then in more recent years, the last three or four years, it's just been vacant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4559)|
| 1:16:04| was purchased by the Hobby Lobby Corporation of Oklahoma City| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4564)|
| 1:16:08| and donated to our organization, Primary Focus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4568)|
| 1:16:11| We are an educational 501C3, and I'm from San Diego originally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4571)|
| 1:16:16| and recently there was an article, I think, in the paper that said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4576)|
| 1:16:19| San Diego, wouldn't you know it, I knew that would happen if I didn't turn it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4579)|
| 1:16:24| San Diego and Knoxville were tied for third place in the finest place to live,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4584)|
| 1:16:29| I just came from San Diego after 20 years, and I don't know what the issue is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4589)|
| 1:16:33| I'd just like to know who voted, because I don't know why we weren't number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4593)|
| 1:16:36| But anyway, the property was given to us, seven and a half acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4596)|
| 1:16:40| donated to our nonprofit organization, and what we do, ladies and gentlemen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4600)|
| 1:16:44| is we go into the public elementary schools of America, and we take traditional family values,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4604)|
| 1:16:49| and we take a musical assembly program featuring college-age young people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4609)|
| 1:16:54| who volunteer one year of their life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4614)|
| 1:16:57| That must be my wife, and she's going to kill me later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4617)|
| 1:17:02| And what we do is with a musical assembly program with these volunteer college-age young people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4622)|
| 1:17:06| who give a year of their life, we go into over 1,800 public elementary schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4626)|
| 1:17:11| across the United States, presenting these traditional family values| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4631)|
| 1:17:15| in a musical entertaining assembly program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4635)|
| 1:17:17| Of course, entertainment is not our purpose, that's just our method,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4637)|
| 1:17:20| to impact over a million elementary school children every year in the public schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4640)|
| 1:17:25| We're the largest assembly company in the nation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4645)|
| 1:17:28| And we were given that building, and so what we've done in the last nine months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4648)|
| 1:17:32| is converted the 9,000 square foot of office space right on Asheville Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4652)|
| 1:17:36| directly across the street from the property we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4656)|
| 1:17:39| And we've spent about $700,000 to convert it into office space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4659)|
| 1:17:44| There's a kitchen, there's a rehearsal hall, meeting place, and our general office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4664)|
| 1:17:48| It's now our national headquarters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4668)|
| 1:17:50| So the national headquarters for reaching children and promoting family traditional values| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4670)|
| 1:17:55| is directly across the street from the property we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4675)|
| 1:17:58| And we've made our home here now in Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4678)|
| 1:18:01| And we don't mean to besmirch anybody, but I can't tell you how delighted we would be as brand new neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4681)|
| 1:18:07| We just dedicated this building last month to, in fact, our young people from all over America,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4687)|
| 1:18:12| the young people who perform in our organization and travel throughout the country giving one year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4692)|
| 1:18:17| they come from all over America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4697)|
| 1:18:19| They're training today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4699)|
| 1:18:20| They'll be leaving in about three weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4700)|
| 1:18:22| And I can't tell you the number of people we'll have coming to that location to meet our team members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4702)|
| 1:18:29| to purchase videos, to purchase CDs, just to come and get more information on how to help raise their children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4709)|
| 1:18:35| And it would be a delight to have a park across the street in that part of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4715)|
| 1:18:40| A lot has gone on in the last several years with the church expansion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4720)|
| 1:18:43| the retirement center that's adjacent to the church on the other side, and now our building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4723)|
| 1:18:48| I don't know if you've been by it, but we've painted it, we've cleaned it up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4728)|
| 1:18:51| and we've invested hundreds of thousands of dollars, and we're proud to be part of the Knox family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4731)|
| 1:18:57| And you now are the leaders of this national organization that's doing such a tremendous work throughout the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4737)|
| 1:19:04| And so I just wanted to let you know we were now there directly across the street, and we'd be thrilled to have a park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4744)|
| 1:19:11| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4751)|
| 1:19:17| Commissioner Cate, you've got your light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4757)|
| 1:19:20| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4760)|
| 1:19:22| I spent some time on the phone yesterday with Ms. Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4762)|
| 1:19:26| Not to forget the fact I actually grew up over behind Burlington,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4766)|
| 1:19:29| and I remember going to Calloway's hardware store and getting my hair cut in the Piggly Wiggly IGA supermarket there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4769)|
| 1:19:37| I, as Ms. Davis did, had concerns about getting the other property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4777)|
| 1:19:41| After what Commissioner Strickland has said, I'm prepared to support his and Commissioner Jordan's motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4781)|
| 1:19:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4790)|
| 1:19:51| Do we have any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4791)|
| 1:19:54| I just want to say that I'm going to support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4794)|
| 1:19:56| Commissioner Strickland and Commissioner Jordan have, I think they've communicated with us how important it is to their community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4796)|
| 1:20:03| so I look forward to supporting both of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4803)|
| 1:20:06| We've got a substitute motion on the floor, I think, to approve with the city buying the piece of property, $150,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4806)|
| 1:20:13| seconded by Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4813)|
| 1:20:17| Mayor Ragsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4817)|
| 1:20:18| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4818)|
| 1:20:19| You may want to consider this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4819)|
| 1:20:21| The property is appraised at $170,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4821)|
| 1:20:24| and you may want to consider a motion where the city would donate $150,000 to the project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4824)|
| 1:20:29| because we're actually planning on paying the difference, and money has been budgeted for that already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4829)|
| 1:20:33| So that's for your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4833)|
| 1:20:35| To do anything else, I don't know if it would delay it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4835)|
| 1:20:40| Mr. Pinkston, you're saying the Lariat Lounge has been appraised for $170,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4840)|
| 1:20:45| Well, have they agreed to take $170,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4845)|
| 1:20:49| No, but I'm prepared to move on $170,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4849)|
| 1:20:52| So, and I'll recommend that to you if they don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4852)|
| 1:20:55| You're asking Knox County to pay $20,000 over the $150,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4855)|
| 1:20:58| You say the city's budgeted for that purchase?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4858)|
| 1:21:00| We've arranged for that to happen and planned on that happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4860)|
| 1:21:03| What if it's another $100,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4863)|
| 1:21:06| We won't be, we'll take a different course of action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4866)|
| 1:21:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4869)|
| 1:21:10| Then I'll amend it this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4870)|
| 1:21:12| I want to see this project done out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4872)|
| 1:21:15| We'll buy this piece of property for $125,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4875)|
| 1:21:18| but we're not to give the city over $20,000 more towards the Lariat Lounge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4878)|
| 1:21:25| In other words, you say if it's over $170,000 we won't buy the Lariat Lounge, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4885)|
| 1:21:31| I'm not saying we won't buy it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4891)|
| 1:21:32| We won't negotiate with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4892)|
| 1:21:34| Well, if the city is going to pay $150,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4894)|
| 1:21:36| what if they come back and want more than what it's appraised in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4896)|
| 1:21:38| Then we'll take a different course of action with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4898)|
| 1:21:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4903)|
| 1:21:44| Given the city, given the county $150,000 for us to be the lead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4904)|
| 1:21:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4908)|
| 1:21:49| I'll amend this for us not to pay over $20,000 more towards the city's purchase price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4909)|
| 1:21:57| I think maybe the county is going to purchase it, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4917)|
| 1:21:59| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4919)|
| 1:22:00| The city has just given us $150,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4920)|
| 1:22:02| Towards the Lariat Lounge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4922)|
| 1:22:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4923)|
| 1:22:04| When did you talk to the owners of the Lariat Lounge last, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4924)|
| 1:22:06| We've had some ongoing conversations with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4926)|
| 1:22:09| How long ago?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4929)|
| 1:22:10| Well, I haven't done the conversations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4930)|
| 1:22:12| but our staff has had frequent conversations with them, the PBA and others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4932)|
| 1:22:18| Well, you know, I hate to obligate Knox County for something that we don't even know what the price is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4938)|
| 1:22:23| Who's been talking to these people at the Lariat Lounge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4943)|
| 1:22:25| Which one in your staff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4945)|
| 1:22:27| Ms. Finch has, along with public building authority and others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4947)|
| 1:22:29| Do you care to come to the podium, Ms. Finch?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4949)|
| 1:22:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4954)|
| 1:22:35| Have you reached some kind of price agreement, range,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4955)|
| 1:22:37| or anything on what the purchase of this Lariat Lounge might be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4957)|
| 1:22:40| Well, initially in 2005, the appraisal price was about $105,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4960)|
| 1:22:46| As we began to negotiate with the owners of the Lariat Lounge, they asked us to have a new appraisal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4966)|
| 1:22:51| That appraisal came in at $170,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4971)|
| 1:22:54| We offered them that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4974)|
| 1:22:56| They've asked for up to $200,000, but we're still in the negotiating part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4976)|
| 1:23:01| Lariat Lounge, the last time that the PBA law department was talking to the owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4981)|
| 1:23:07| it was $200,000 that they was requesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4987)|
| 1:23:10| But we offered them $170,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4990)|
| 1:23:14| You've offered them $170,000 and they want $200,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4994)|
| 1:23:17| And you've got a firm commitment on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=4997)|
| 1:23:20| A $200,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5000)|
| 1:23:21| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5001)|
| 1:23:22| Pretty much that was their counteroffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5002)|
| 1:23:25| Do you have anything in writing on that or anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5005)|
| 1:23:27| I mean, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5007)|
| 1:23:28| I don't have anything with me right this minute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5008)|
| 1:23:30| but I'm just going by the information that has been provided to us by PBA's attorney,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5010)|
| 1:23:36| who has been doing the negotiation on behalf of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5016)|
| 1:23:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5019)|
| 1:23:40| It's very apparent that these people out there need help with that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5020)|
| 1:23:43| I feel like that the city has failed them on this, and so they've come forth to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5023)|
| 1:23:49| We make this amendment that we buy the lot that we're talking about for $125,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5029)|
| 1:23:56| but we're not to give the city over $30,000 more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5036)|
| 1:24:00| Now, Mr. Finch, I'm using your figures there at $200,000 towards the Lariat Lounge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5040)|
| 1:24:06| and it is contingent on getting the Lariat Lounge bought for $200,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5046)|
| 1:24:13| If I'm not mistaken, doesn't everything have to come before this body anyway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5053)|
| 1:24:18| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5058)|
| 1:24:19| The deal, whatever the deal they can cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5059)|
| 1:24:22| Beg your pardon, Tank, I didn't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5062)|
| 1:24:23| It has to come before this body anyway to buy the Lariat Lounge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5063)|
| 1:24:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5068)|
| 1:24:29| But I don't want to commit us buying this lot if we can't get the Lariat Lounge bought, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5069)|
| 1:24:36| because that's not going to help these people with the problem they have out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5076)|
| 1:24:39| They're wanting this problem corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5079)|
| 1:24:41| It's a blighted area, and we need to correct it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5081)|
| 1:24:44| I'm willing to go for buying this property contingent on us getting this other piece of property bought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5084)|
| 1:24:49| for not over $200,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5089)|
| 1:24:51| Wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5091)|
| 1:24:55| I think $170,000 is what the Lariat Lounge is worth, and I think we really need to stick to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5095)|
| 1:25:03| We're going to try our best, but here's an example, and I think a good one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5103)|
| 1:25:07| South Knoxville Senior Center is in a very good location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5107)|
| 1:25:10| We paid $200,000 more than the appraised value for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5110)|
| 1:25:13| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5113)|
| 1:25:14| How much?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5114)|
| 1:25:15| I think it was $200,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5115)|
| 1:25:17| I believe you're wrong on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5117)|
| 1:25:18| I hate to correct you on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5118)|
| 1:25:19| Well, that's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5119)|
| 1:25:20| We'll check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5120)|
| 1:25:21| We paid over the appraised value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5121)|
| 1:25:22| $225,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5122)|
| 1:25:23| I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5123)|
| 1:25:24| We paid over the appraised value for the property because we needed the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5124)|
| 1:25:27| It was the best location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5127)|
| 1:25:28| It's what the citizens wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5128)|
| 1:25:29| Now, we're not going to go out and be hijacked over this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5129)|
| 1:25:33| On the other hand, I don't want to pin ourselves completely down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5133)|
| 1:25:37| It will come back before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5137)|
| 1:25:38| But the first step that we need to do is to go ahead and get this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5138)|
| 1:25:41| and then we'll start dealing with the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5141)|
| 1:25:42| We've already been involved with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5142)|
| 1:25:44| And I've made a commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5144)|
| 1:25:45| I think each of you, if I'm reading the body right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5145)|
| 1:25:47| I'm making a commitment to get this problem fixed, and we need to go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5147)|
| 1:25:50| But today you take the first step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5150)|
| 1:25:52| You buy the first piece of land, and we're going to get the second piece of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5152)|
| 1:25:54| But we have no commitment what these people are going to sell this property for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5154)|
| 1:25:57| Now, you can bring in the South Knoxville Senior Center, but we had a commitment on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5157)|
| 1:26:01| And I believe if you'll check, that was $25,000 more than the appraised value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5161)|
| 1:26:04| Well, in any event, it was more than the appraised value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5164)|
| 1:26:06| We're willing to pay more than this, but we need a commitment for these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5166)|
| 1:26:10| I would make a recommendation that we defer this for 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5170)|
| 1:26:14| until we get a commitment on the Lariat Lounge for not over $200,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5174)|
| 1:26:19| Now, we've got these people out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5179)|
| 1:26:21| They're up here pleading for help, and I want to help them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5181)|
| 1:26:23| but it's not going to do us any good to buy this lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5183)|
| 1:26:26| and then the lounge come back and want a whole lot more money for it, and we can't buy it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5186)|
| 1:26:30| There are other ways to get blighted properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5190)|
| 1:26:32| and we'll deal with that if we have to at a particular point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5192)|
| 1:26:35| But I would hope today that you would take the first step and go ahead and purchase this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5195)|
| 1:26:51| Okay, I'm trying to figure out, do we still have the substitute motion on the floor to buy the property with the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5211)|
| 1:26:57| I've amended it to purchase a Lariat Lounge B there for not over $200,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5217)|
| 1:27:02| That's giving us a $30,000 leeway to buy that property over the appraisal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5222)|
| 1:27:07| Wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5227)|
| 1:27:08| The city has committed $150,000 to the Lariat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5228)|
| 1:27:12| The city has only committed for $150,000, and if we have to buy it for two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5232)|
| 1:27:16| then the county has committed for the extra $50,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5236)|
| 1:27:19| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5239)|
| 1:27:20| But she said, but Ms. Finch says it is appraised for $170,000, which I'll take her word on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5240)|
| 1:27:25| So I'm willing to go $30,000 more with appraisal because it is an income producing business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5245)|
| 1:27:31| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5251)|
| 1:27:35| Okay, I think Commissioner Lambert seconded it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5255)|
| 1:27:38| Yeah, I seconded it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5258)|
| 1:27:39| But I have a real problem with going to the $200,000, allocating ourselves to the $200,000 mark,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5259)|
| 1:27:47| because that's not $20,000 or $30,000 from county government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5267)|
| 1:27:51| That's an additional $50,000 from county government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5271)|
| 1:27:54| And I know this is going to sound pretty unusual coming from me because I am usually the one that is against eminent domain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5274)|
| 1:28:03| Eminent domain is that other option, I'm assuming, that we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5283)|
| 1:28:08| And it was put there, you know, it's very clear when eminent domain is appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5288)|
| 1:28:13| and when eminent domain is not appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5293)|
| 1:28:16| Eminent domain, I believe, is very appropriate when we're talking about a public project that's going to benefit all people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5296)|
| 1:28:23| It's going to be a government project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5303)|
| 1:28:25| And what it's put there for is so that one property owner doesn't sit there and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5305)|
| 1:28:30| well, I'm just going to make them pay me a premium because they can't build their courthouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5310)|
| 1:28:37| They can't build their park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5317)|
| 1:28:38| They can't build their road without my property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5318)|
| 1:28:41| And that's why government has the power of eminent domain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5321)|
| 1:28:47| It's not so they can do the kind of things they did in Connecticut with the famous Kelo decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5327)|
| 1:28:53| It was to do things exactly like this right here to make sure that one property owner doesn't gouge government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5333)|
| 1:29:01| And so I think we need to step forward with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5341)|
| 1:29:03| And I think that we need to keep the provision that we purchased the Lariat Lounge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5343)|
| 1:29:11| But I think that we need to keep it at an additional $20,000 from Knox County paired with the $150,000 from Knoxville City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5351)|
| 1:29:21| And that gets us at the appraised value, which I've looked at the Lariat Lounge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5361)|
| 1:29:25| and I think that $170,000 is fairly generous for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5365)|
| 1:29:31| And so, I mean, I like everything about your proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5371)|
| 1:29:35| except I'd like to cap it at $170,000 instead of going up to $200,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5375)|
| 1:29:39| because you're talking an extra $30,000 from an already strained county budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5379)|
| 1:29:46| And would you be okay with that if we capped it at $170,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5386)|
| 1:29:50| Well, here's the way I'm looking at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5390)|
| 1:29:52| First of all, I don't know whether the county can do eminent domain on that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5392)|
| 1:29:56| not since it's in kind of corporate city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5396)|
| 1:29:59| But I'm putting myself, and I think everybody up here should put theirself in the property holder's position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5399)|
| 1:30:06| They have a piece of property there, whether you like it or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5406)|
| 1:30:09| that my understanding is it's bringing in $1,400 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5409)|
| 1:30:14| Now, they are entitled to more than just what their property is appraised at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5414)|
| 1:30:18| I know I wouldn't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5418)|
| 1:30:19| So I'm going to say $30,000 over the appraisal, that we cap it at not over $200,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5419)|
| 1:30:26| but I'm expecting, Cynthia, are you the one negotiating the deals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5426)|
| 1:30:31| I'm expecting that we go put that cap on there, and I expect her to try to negotiate a better deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5431)|
| 1:30:38| She can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5438)|
| 1:30:39| But with me already saying where the cap is, I feel sure they're not going to take less than $200,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5439)|
| 1:30:45| But I want to see this go out there because it's hard for me to believe that these people have been complaining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5445)|
| 1:30:50| about this property for 11 years and there's nothing been done about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5450)|
| 1:30:55| And we've got a piece of property there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5455)|
| 1:30:56| You're talking about this lot that we're buying for $125,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5456)|
| 1:31:00| There's not even been a building, any business on there for the last three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5460)|
| 1:31:04| That property should have been condemned and that building torn down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5464)|
| 1:31:07| and then we could have bought it for less than $125,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5467)|
| 1:31:10| Now, these people are the taxpayers out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5470)|
| 1:31:12| They're paying for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5472)|
| 1:31:14| So I'm not asking the county to pay it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5474)|
| 1:31:17| I'm asking the taxpayers out there for it, and they need a break, and they want it cleared up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5477)|
| 1:31:22| But we do need to be sure that we have this Lariat Lounge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5482)|
| 1:31:26| Now, if we don't get that bought, who wants a piece of property for a park next to a bar?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5486)|
| 1:31:31| And it's still not solving their problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5491)|
| 1:31:33| You still have a blighted area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5493)|
| 1:31:36| But we do need to put a cap on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5496)|
| 1:31:38| And that's my amendment, not over $200,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5498)|
| 1:31:41| If we can't get the Lariat Lounge bought for that, then the other piece of property is off the pole too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5501)|
| 1:31:48| Commissioner Ballard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5508)|
| 1:31:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5509)|
| 1:31:50| Now, I heard you say if we bought it, then we need to tear it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5510)|
| 1:31:53| Knox County ought to tear it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5513)|
| 1:31:54| No, what I said is, let me clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5514)|
| 1:31:57| If this preacher here, he does not have anything in a written agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5517)|
| 1:32:01| he said this gentleman would tear it down, then we should tear it down if he does not do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5521)|
| 1:32:06| if he does not honor his word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5526)|
| 1:32:08| My thought on that is that we have a value of $30,000, so we're just sort of swapping bucks here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5528)|
| 1:32:14| If you take your $20,000 and the $30,000 that we don't have to do it to the $150,000, that gives us the $200,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5534)|
| 1:32:20| And it seems to me like the problem would be solved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5540)|
| 1:32:24| That's a good statement to make, if the man keeps his word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5544)|
| 1:32:33| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5553)|
| 1:32:35| Mayor, let me ask you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5555)|
| 1:32:36| And that's why I asked the pastor to mention that about the tearing that down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5556)|
| 1:32:41| because that was going to save us some money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5561)|
| 1:32:43| Mayor, how does this work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5563)|
| 1:32:45| You know, I hate that we talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5565)|
| 1:32:46| To me, the more we talk about it, the more this just drives this price up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5566)|
| 1:32:50| You know, I have bought and sold some real estate before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5570)|
| 1:32:52| You know, guys, we're spending tax dollars as long as we talk on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5572)|
| 1:32:56| Mayor, when Cynthia goes and tries to work on this and gets this down, if we keep it at the $170,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5576)|
| 1:33:02| and it doesn't go, they come back to us and say, no, we need $175,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5582)|
| 1:33:07| Then you guys come back to us and we approach this next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5587)|
| 1:33:10| Because, Paul, I'm afraid if we give them that much latitude,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5590)|
| 1:33:13| then whoever this person owns this is going to sit out there and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5593)|
| 1:33:15| hey, I'm not going to sell for anything less than $200,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5595)|
| 1:33:18| You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5598)|
| 1:33:19| We've opened that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5599)|
| 1:33:20| But here's the thing about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5600)|
| 1:33:21| There's been bad leadership on buying this property out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5601)|
| 1:33:23| Both of these properties should have been tied up and negotiated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5603)|
| 1:33:26| And the price put on the line, what we were paying for them to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5606)|
| 1:33:29| Well, they're holding the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5609)|
| 1:33:31| I mean, they offered to what, $170,000, and they come back $200,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5611)|
| 1:33:33| and they're still staying firm at their price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5613)|
| 1:33:36| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5616)|
| 1:33:37| If it's appraised at $170,000, now, that's Ms. Finch's appraisal on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5617)|
| 1:33:42| If it's appraised at that, I'm saying, Lord, have mercy, I don't go to these places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5622)|
| 1:33:46| Not that I'm talking about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5626)|
| 1:33:48| But the gentleman is entitled for something more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5628)|
| 1:33:53| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5633)|
| 1:33:54| Because he does have an income-producing piece of property, Larry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5634)|
| 1:33:58| Any way you want to put it, he's got $1,400 a month coming in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5638)|
| 1:34:01| so how many years are you talking about before he gets his $30,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5641)|
| 1:34:06| Two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5646)|
| 1:34:08| But these people need a problem, and it needs to be taken care of and addressed today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5648)|
| 1:34:11| But we do need to know, and we need to let the gentleman in on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5651)|
| 1:34:15| Who owns this property anyway, Ms. Finch?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5655)|
| 1:34:21| Who owns the Lariat Lounge property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5661)|
| 1:34:23| Sandra K. White-McMillan is the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5663)|
| 1:34:26| Is she any relation to the people in the other property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5666)|
| 1:34:32| They're sisters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5672)|
| 1:34:34| Why have we been negotiating to deal with one piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5674)|
| 1:34:37| when it's instrumental for us to have this other, and we have an agreement on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5677)|
| 1:34:41| Mr. Pinkham, we have been negotiating with both of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5681)|
| 1:34:44| It's just that they've been coming back with a counteroffer every time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5684)|
| 1:34:46| But you know that when we buy this first piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5686)|
| 1:34:50| that's automatically going to make them go up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5690)|
| 1:34:52| and that's why I'm saying we need to limit it to the $200,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5692)|
| 1:34:55| And I think that's fair for everybody concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5695)|
| 1:34:58| Now, maybe I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5698)|
| 1:35:01| I'd like to ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5701)|
| 1:35:04| I'm clearing it up just a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5704)|
| 1:35:06| If we have 150 commitment from the city, again, and Paul wants to go 20,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5706)|
| 1:35:13| and it would take Knox County $30,000 to clean it up, can we just not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5713)|
| 1:35:18| instead of just limiting it to 20, Paul, can't we say 50?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5718)|
| 1:35:22| It would be a done deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5722)|
| 1:35:23| I think the property would sell for $200,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5723)|
| 1:35:25| That's what I'm saying, $200,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5725)|
| 1:35:27| But, Juan, is your guy saying 20 or 50?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5727)|
| 1:35:31| I'm saying the 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5731)|
| 1:35:32| It's $30,000 over the appraisal price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5732)|
| 1:35:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5734)|
| 1:35:35| Let me say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5735)|
| 1:35:36| Wait, Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5736)|
| 1:35:38| What if we just leave the dollar amount out of it because it's got to come back to this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5738)|
| 1:35:42| let the people who are going to be dealing with the trying to get the property under contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5742)|
| 1:35:48| and then come back to us with whatever the price is and let us decide if we want to buy it or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5748)|
| 1:35:54| Well, we need to defer this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5754)|
| 1:35:56| We're talking about buying now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5756)|
| 1:35:58| Well, you don't have to defer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5758)|
| 1:35:59| I think it's contention on the other sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5759)|
| 1:36:04| I mean, I think Commissioner Strickland and Commissioner Jordan want to see this property get tied up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5764)|
| 1:36:10| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5770)|
| 1:36:11| What's the contract term, Cynthia, on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5771)|
| 1:36:12| Is it coming up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5772)|
| 1:36:13| It's got 30 days on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5773)|
| 1:36:14| Or do we have an option?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5774)|
| 1:36:19| August what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5779)|
| 1:36:22| I think it's the 19th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5782)|
| 1:36:25| Well, I think on this piece of property we're going to have to do something before the end of the contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5785)|
| 1:36:31| or it may continue to go up or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5791)|
| 1:36:35| So I don't want us to cost these other folks or cost the county more money by trying to get out of this contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5795)|
| 1:36:41| that we're already involved in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5801)|
| 1:36:43| So maybe that's the way we need to look at getting this one and doing something with the other one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5803)|
| 1:36:49| let them come back to us with the price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5809)|
| 1:36:52| But I want to help Commissioner Strickland and Commissioner Jordan because I know they've worked hard on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5812)|
| 1:36:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5817)|
| 1:36:59| So let's go to Commissioner Luthold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5819)|
| 1:37:02| Well, I wasn't really first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5822)|
| 1:37:04| But my suggestion here is that Mayor Ragsdale has been to the mic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5824)|
| 1:37:09| and they're the ones that have been negotiating it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5829)|
| 1:37:13| And I just wonder whether a five-minute break, whether they and the wall director get together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5833)|
| 1:37:18| and work out a comment because I'm a little lost as to vote for the substitute of the original one and the arguments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5838)|
| 1:37:24| And I'd like to have some clarity because I want to see this project through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5844)|
| 1:37:29| I just want to make sure I vote on the right one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5849)|
| 1:37:31| And I'm not sure right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5851)|
| 1:37:33| And I don't know if the law department can help in this or not, along with Mayor Ragsdale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5853)|
| 1:37:39| come up with something that we can all kind of agree on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5859)|
| 1:37:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5865)|
| 1:37:48| Commissioner Craig Luthold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5868)|
| 1:37:52| I guess my point is I think this project needs to move forward however we need to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5872)|
| 1:37:59| I'd like to see us go ahead and tie up this piece of property and try to negotiate with the other one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5879)|
| 1:38:06| And I'm prepared to go ahead and purchase, vote to purchase this property today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5886)|
| 1:38:13| But I do have a concern that, you know, we're still waiting for the city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5893)|
| 1:38:18| and the mayor of the city to put their commitment of $150,000 in writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5898)|
| 1:38:25| So I'd like to see that be part of the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5905)|
| 1:38:28| But I am prepared to move on this today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5908)|
| 1:38:32| Commissioner Kate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5912)|
| 1:38:33| Okay, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5913)|
| 1:38:36| I'm leery about putting any number on anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5916)|
| 1:38:38| I mean, if we go to 200, that's where they're going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5918)|
| 1:38:40| That's exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5920)|
| 1:38:41| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5921)|
| 1:38:42| This is kind of property negotiation 101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5922)|
| 1:38:44| I'm ready to vote for Commissioner Strickland and Jordan's motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5924)|
| 1:38:48| Let them go do the best they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5928)|
| 1:38:49| I think the mayor and I will certainly support what he said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5929)|
| 1:38:54| We're going to get the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5934)|
| 1:38:56| So with that in mind, I think they might be a little easier to negotiate with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5936)|
| 1:39:00| So, Cynthia, go get tough with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5940)|
| 1:39:04| Here, 145.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5944)|
| 1:39:05| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5945)|
| 1:39:07| Yes, I think we've just seen a good demonstration of why you don't have a 19-person negotiation committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5947)|
| 1:39:18| And as much as there have been good ideas raised, there's just too many of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5958)|
| 1:39:22| But I think Commissioner Craig-Luthell has the right idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5962)|
| 1:39:25| I think the only thing on which this should be made contingent is a city putting in writing its $150,000 commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5965)|
| 1:39:32| After that, I think the power of eminent domain, which in this case is a proper use, as Commissioner Lambert has pointed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5972)|
| 1:39:39| is a good weapon and tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5979)|
| 1:39:41| And we shouldn't get involved in throwing out numbers because, as Commissioner Cate has suggested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5981)|
| 1:39:45| the price will immediately rise to any number that we point out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5985)|
| 1:39:49| So I think the only appropriate conditioning or amending of this motion should be simply that condition on the city providing the promised $150,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5989)|
| 1:39:57| That seems to be the most logical answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=5997)|
| 1:40:02| Commissioner Trammell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6002)|
| 1:40:04| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6004)|
| 1:40:05| The only thing wrong with this is it's backwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6005)|
| 1:40:07| We should have this lariat lounge in front of us first and then a second piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6007)|
| 1:40:12| But with the commitments made, you know, we have eminent domain we can use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6012)|
| 1:40:18| Let's move forward with Mr. Strickland here and Commissioner Jordan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6018)|
| 1:40:23| But that's the only problem here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6023)|
| 1:40:24| We've just got it reversed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6024)|
| 1:40:25| If we had it turned around and had the lariat lounge before us in the beginning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6025)|
| 1:40:30| and I think that's where this has kind of got sidetracked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6030)|
| 1:40:36| and then we're voting on a vacant piece of property beside the lariat lounge, it makes it much, much easier on us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6036)|
| 1:40:40| But, you know, this job ain't easy, is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6040)|
| 1:40:43| So I'll make a motion to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6043)|
| 1:40:46| Hang on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6046)|
| 1:40:47| We can't make no more motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6047)|
| 1:40:48| We've got plenty of them on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6048)|
| 1:40:50| I was going to try to clarify something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6050)|
| 1:40:52| Can we call for the question then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6052)|
| 1:40:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6055)|
| 1:40:56| Mayor Ragsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6056)|
| 1:40:57| We have tried to negotiate them both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6057)|
| 1:40:59| We had one person who wanted to negotiate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6059)|
| 1:41:01| We've had another who's kept going up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6061)|
| 1:41:03| So that's why we're in the situation we're in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6063)|
| 1:41:04| But I do think we need to go forward and get this one piece of property today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6064)|
| 1:41:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6069)|
| 1:41:10| We've had a call for the question, but we've got some lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6070)|
| 1:41:12| Mr. Strickland wants to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6072)|
| 1:41:15| I think it's appropriate since it's in his district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6075)|
| 1:41:17| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6077)|
| 1:41:19| I'm definitely voting against the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6079)|
| 1:41:22| I think we need to go ahead and get this first piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6082)|
| 1:41:25| and then let the administration go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6085)|
| 1:41:27| and deal with the second piece of property, the Lariat Lounge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6087)|
| 1:41:31| The $150,000 is guaranteed from the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6091)|
| 1:41:35| I believe Mayor Haslam, and I also believe Larry Morton, and all of you know them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6095)|
| 1:41:41| The money is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6101)|
| 1:41:44| And I think we need to go ahead and get this piece of property first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6104)|
| 1:41:49| So I'm voting against the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6109)|
| 1:41:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6114)|
| 1:41:55| If the commission don't mind, we had a call for the question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6115)|
| 1:41:57| but do you want to get the rest of the lights?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6117)|
| 1:41:59| We've got three more lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6119)|
| 1:42:00| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6120)|
| 1:42:02| Two more lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6122)|
| 1:42:03| Exactly where are we at on the substitute motion now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6123)|
| 1:42:06| Is it contingent on the $150,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6126)|
| 1:42:09| or is it contingent on that we acquire the Lariat as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6129)|
| 1:42:16| I think we need to buy the Lariat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6136)|
| 1:42:18| These figures, I didn't throw them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6138)|
| 1:42:22| These figures came from the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6142)|
| 1:42:25| They said the appraisal was $170,000 on the Lariat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6145)|
| 1:42:31| They said that the people had talked that they would take $200,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6151)|
| 1:42:37| Commissioner Strickland said the city would pay $150,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6157)|
| 1:42:41| and the mayor came up and stood there, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6161)|
| 1:42:43| and said they had committed to $150,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6163)|
| 1:42:45| Is that correct, Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6165)|
| 1:42:46| What I'm saying is we need to stop it at the $200,000, even if we have to pay that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6166)|
| 1:42:52| and buy both pieces of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6172)|
| 1:42:54| And the figures totaled up $375,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6174)|
| 1:42:59| Now, that's using the figures that they say they'll take for the Lariat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6179)|
| 1:43:02| But this property is not going to help these people out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6182)|
| 1:43:06| They want this black cleared up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6186)|
| 1:43:08| And if we don't get this other piece of property, they've still got the same problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6188)|
| 1:43:12| And when we buy this piece of property for $125,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6192)|
| 1:43:16| that's going to give the people with the Lariat Lounge more leverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6196)|
| 1:43:20| Now, these are relatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6200)|
| 1:43:22| And if we make it contingent on buying the Lariat Lounge for $200,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6202)|
| 1:43:26| and the other piece for $125,000, we're driving the car instead of them driving the car| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6206)|
| 1:43:30| because let them argue out whether or not they want to get together selling it instead of us arguing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6210)|
| 1:43:35| Now, Paul, one car dealer to another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6215)|
| 1:43:41| If we, I mean, you know, we're on TV here, and these folks are probably watching this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6221)|
| 1:43:50| Now, if I'm going to sell somebody a car and I know that their wife has already told them they can pay my asking price,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6230)|
| 1:44:00| I'm not going to budge a penny because I know that they're going to pay the asking price if they ask to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6240)|
| 1:44:06| And I just don't feel comfortable putting a number to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6246)|
| 1:44:10| I feel comfortable putting a condition that the Lariat is able to be acquired through some shape, form, or fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6250)|
| 1:44:19| But I just don't feel comfortable putting a number on this because guess what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6259)|
| 1:44:23| We're going out on these cameras and the price becomes $200,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6263)|
| 1:44:28| when I'm not necessarily sure that it's worth $200,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6268)|
| 1:44:32| And I think we need to just leave it that the acquisition of the Lariat is tied to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6272)|
| 1:44:39| and then let our negotiating team go out and get the best price they can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6279)|
| 1:44:43| rather than in front of all these TV cameras, give them permission to pay $200,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6283)|
| 1:44:47| on something that I don't know enough about whether it's worth that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6287)|
| 1:44:51| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6291)|
| 1:44:52| Hang on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6292)|
| 1:44:53| Let me say one thing before we.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6293)|
| 1:44:54| Just something real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6294)|
| 1:44:56| If Commissioner Lambert's withdrawn his second to the substitute motion, we no longer have a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6296)|
| 1:45:03| We don't have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6303)|
| 1:45:04| I'm negotiating whether I'll withdraw my second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6304)|
| 1:45:06| If we can go with just that the Lariat be acquired as a contention on this, then my second is still firmly there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6306)|
| 1:45:13| Let me say one thing, Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6313)|
| 1:45:16| Let me say one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6316)|
| 1:45:17| We've only got like 20 days on the option on the vacant piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6317)|
| 1:45:23| I don't know if these people can get a contract signed within 20 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6323)|
| 1:45:27| and then it messes up the contract that we have on the vacant piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6327)|
| 1:45:32| So, you know, I'd like to support Commissioner Strickland and Jordan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6332)|
| 1:45:37| And, I mean, Commissioner, they can get an option on that in less days than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6337)|
| 1:45:41| Now, here's the thing about it, Mr. Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6341)|
| 1:45:44| This property rents for $1,400 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6344)|
| 1:45:48| That's $17,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6348)|
| 1:45:50| These people are entitled to something for their income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6350)|
| 1:45:52| Now, I'm not taking the Lariat Lounge property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6352)|
| 1:45:54| They're entitled to something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6354)|
| 1:45:55| I want to get this piece of property voted out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6355)|
| 1:45:57| Now, Cynthia says they said they would take $200,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6357)|
| 1:46:01| But if we buy that lot without buying the Lariat Lounge with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6361)|
| 1:46:06| then what we're doing is buying a car without a motor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6366)|
| 1:46:09| Well, I'm with you there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6369)|
| 1:46:11| No, we're going to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6371)|
| 1:46:12| I think the administration said we're going to buy that piece of property or we're going to take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6372)|
| 1:46:16| Now, I don't believe that we have the authority to take that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6376)|
| 1:46:20| Yeah, I think we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6380)|
| 1:46:21| You see, Knox County is within the city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6381)|
| 1:46:24| So, I mean, I think we're going to get the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6384)|
| 1:46:28| It's just a matter of them getting a contract and whatever the price is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6388)|
| 1:46:32| And my concern is if we say $200,000 here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6392)|
| 1:46:36| and Ms. Finch goes back to these folks and says, okay, we're offering you $170,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6396)|
| 1:46:42| they're going to say, well, I was watching Channel 12 the other day and you can pay me $200,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6402)|
| 1:46:47| So you give me $200,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6407)|
| 1:46:48| Mr. Lambert, let me ask you this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6408)|
| 1:46:50| You're in business, you say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6410)|
| 1:46:52| You own your property out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6412)|
| 1:46:54| Would you sell your business and your property both for just what it's appraised at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6414)|
| 1:46:59| What's your property's appraised at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6419)|
| 1:47:00| It depends on who did the appraisal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6420)|
| 1:47:01| Now, I'm not sure whether I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6421)|
| 1:47:03| If.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6423)|
| 1:47:04| If.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6424)|
| 1:47:05| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6425)|
| 1:47:06| Let me tell you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6426)|
| 1:47:07| I'll vote for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6427)|
| 1:47:08| Mr. Chairman, let me raise a point of order here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6428)|
| 1:47:12| Mr. Pinkston has a motion, but his second no longer agrees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6432)|
| 1:47:15| No, his second's not dropped off yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6435)|
| 1:47:17| Not dropped off yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6437)|
| 1:47:18| We're negotiating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6438)|
| 1:47:19| Well, I don't know how much you can negotiate a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6439)|
| 1:47:22| But if there's not a second, like I suggest this to Commissioner Lambert, if there's not a second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6442)|
| 1:47:27| then we can revert to the original motion and vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6447)|
| 1:47:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6453)|
| 1:47:34| We've got a substitute motion to purchase the property at no more than $200,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6454)|
| 1:47:46| Is everybody ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6466)|
| 1:47:48| I'm withdrawing my second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6468)|
| 1:47:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6472)|
| 1:47:53| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6473)|
| 1:47:55| To withdraw it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6475)|
| 1:47:56| Oh, we don't need a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6476)|
| 1:47:57| We don't need a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6477)|
| 1:47:58| We don't need a second to withdraw his second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6478)|
| 1:48:01| The same two people have been arguing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6481)|
| 1:48:04| This is democracy, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6484)|
| 1:48:06| It goes back to the original.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6486)|
| 1:48:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6488)|
| 1:48:09| If we don't have a second, let me give a fair shot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6489)|
| 1:48:11| Do we have a second for Commissioner Pinkston's substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6491)|
| 1:48:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6496)|
| 1:48:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6502)|
| 1:48:23| Commissioner Trammell will second it for Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6503)|
| 1:48:25| So the motion is to put on the buying the property at 4626 Asheville Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6505)|
| 1:48:34| in contingence of getting the other piece of property at a value of no more than $200,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6514)|
| 1:48:40| So everybody ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6520)|
| 1:48:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6522)|
| 1:48:43| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6523)|
| 1:48:44| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6524)|
| 1:48:45| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6525)|
| 1:48:46| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6526)|
| 1:48:48| And the Chair is going to rule that the substitute motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6528)|
| 1:48:52| And we're back on the original motion to purchase 4626 Asheville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6532)|
| 1:48:57| The motion was made by Commissioner Strickland and seconded by Commissioner Jordan, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6537)|
| 1:49:02| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6542)|
| 1:49:03| No more discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6543)|
| 1:49:04| Substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6544)|
| 1:49:05| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6545)|
| 1:49:06| I can make a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6546)|
| 1:49:07| I know you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6547)|
| 1:49:08| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6548)|
| 1:49:10| I make the substitute motion that we simply tie this to the contingent of the sale of the lariat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6550)|
| 1:49:15| with no numbers connected with that sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6555)|
| 1:49:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6558)|
| 1:49:19| Do you have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6559)|
| 1:49:21| Does Commissioner Lambert have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6561)|
| 1:49:24| I guess not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6564)|
| 1:49:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6565)|
| 1:49:26| We're back on the original motion to purchase the land at 4626 Asheville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6566)|
| 1:49:29| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6569)|
| 1:49:31| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6571)|
| 1:49:32| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6572)|
| 1:49:33| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6573)|
| 1:49:37| Commissioner Pinkston, anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6577)|
| 1:49:39| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6579)|
| 1:49:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6582)|

| 1:49:45| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6585)|
| 1:49:46| I want the people out there to know I've been trying to help them by getting the lariat lounge bought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6586)|
| 1:49:49| When it comes back up here we may not be able to get it bought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6589)|
| 1:49:52| And I just want you to realize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6592)|
| 1:49:53| I've really been trying to work with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6593)|

| 1:51:05| and now it's at 1407 Borough, which I'm not sure which district it's in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6665)|
| 1:51:10| I think it's the first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6670)|
| 1:51:12| And I would just like to give the residents of whatever district this lands in the opportunity for 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6672)|
| 1:51:19| to explore whether it fits the Jackson Law and some of the other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6679)|
| 1:51:22| So I would like to defer it for 30 days simply because it keeps moving on us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6682)|
| 1:51:27| and we only received word today about this final location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6687)|
| 1:51:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6690)|
| 1:51:31| Is that your motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6691)|
| 1:51:32| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6692)|
| 1:51:33| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6693)|
| 1:51:34| Second by Commissioner Bolson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6694)|
| 1:51:35| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6695)|
| 1:51:36| John, do you want to say anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6696)|
| 1:51:39| My role in this whole thing was just to help the contractor get on the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6699)|
| 1:51:43| because the Jackson Law can be confusing and misinterpreted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6703)|
| 1:51:48| Tom Carter is here for Mac Tires, and he'd be glad to explain any of the ramifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6708)|
| 1:51:53| All I am is a conduit to get him on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6713)|
| 1:51:56| Is there any problem, sir, in delaying for 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6716)|
| 1:52:07| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6727)|
| 1:52:08| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6728)|
| 1:52:09| We can probably live with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6729)|
| 1:52:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6730)|
| 1:52:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6731)|
| 1:52:12| We've got a motion on the floor to defer 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6732)|
| 1:52:14| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6734)|
| 1:52:15| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6735)|
| 1:52:16| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6736)|
| 1:52:17| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6737)|
| 1:52:18| And it's been deferred 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6738)|
| 1:52:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6744)|
| 1:52:25| Clerk, I think we're on 905.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6745)|
| 1:52:29| Consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6749)|
| 1:52:32| instructing the Knox County Ethics Committee to evaluate the Knox County Ethics Policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6752)|
| 1:52:39| and make recommendations regarding improvements, changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6759)|
| 1:52:42| or clarifications on and before November 1, 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6762)|
| 1:52:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6767)|
| 1:52:48| Intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6768)|
| 1:52:49| Intergovernmental voted 5-0-3-1, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6769)|
| 1:52:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6773)|
| 1:52:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6774)|
| 1:52:55| Finance Committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6775)|
| 1:52:58| 10-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6778)|
| 1:52:59| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6779)|
| 1:53:01| Second by Commissioner who?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6781)|
| 1:53:03| Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6783)|
| 1:53:04| Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6784)|
| 1:53:06| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6786)|
| 1:53:07| Commissioner Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6787)|
| 1:53:11| Guys, I just think this is a bad idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6791)|
| 1:53:14| I think that I certainly think that our ethics policy needs to be clarified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6794)|
| 1:53:20| but I think that needs to be done by commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6800)|
| 1:53:22| I don't believe that we need to have the ethics committee making their rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6802)|
| 1:53:27| which essentially, whatever they recommend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6807)|
| 1:53:30| we're pretty much going to have to vote for, no matter what it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6810)|
| 1:53:34| because the pressure will be that if we, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6814)|
| 1:53:37| if the ethics committee recommends something and we don't go along with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6817)|
| 1:53:40| that we're unethical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6820)|
| 1:53:41| And I just don't think it's ever a good idea to have a body make the rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6821)|
| 1:53:46| and then enforce the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6826)|
| 1:53:47| I certainly think that we need to revisit this and we need to clarify this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6827)|
| 1:53:51| but it needs to be county commission that clarifies our ethics policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6831)|
| 1:53:57| or maybe a separate committee that we form of county commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6837)|
| 1:54:01| And I believe that we need to keep the ethics committee in their role as the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6841)|
| 1:54:06| enforcement and the hearing body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6846)|
| 1:54:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6849)|
| 1:54:10| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6850)|
| 1:54:11| Mr. Hammond had his light on first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6851)|
| 1:54:12| No, that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6852)|
| 1:54:13| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6853)|
| 1:54:14| I was just, you know, we appoint this group as the ethics committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6854)|
| 1:54:20| and we nominated them and, you know, Mr. Landry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6860)|
| 1:54:23| you pick your pastor and some of these other people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6863)|
| 1:54:26| and I think we need to stand by them and do what it says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6866)|
| 1:54:30| You know, I'm not afraid of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6870)|
| 1:54:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6874)|
| 1:54:35| Commissioner Frank Luther?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6875)|
| 1:54:36| Yes, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6876)|
| 1:54:39| The law director has worked on some of those before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6879)|
| 1:54:44| and I think that's where we ought to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6884)|
| 1:54:47| I was just wondering whether we would include the fact that they would take a look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6887)|
| 1:54:53| to start with, what our law director has done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6893)|
| 1:54:56| a review of this across the nation and come up with a recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6896)|
| 1:55:00| and that they would start with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6900)|
| 1:55:02| The same comment would be on the next one, 906,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6902)|
| 1:55:05| that the law department would be the proposal and have them react to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6905)|
| 1:55:11| and bring it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6911)|
| 1:55:13| So that would be a clarification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6913)|
| 1:55:14| and I don't know if that could be included or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6914)|
| 1:55:16| but I think that's just where you start with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6916)|
| 1:55:19| I don't think it changes where it goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6919)|
| 1:55:21| It's just rather than trying to cut it from whole cloth when he's already worked on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6921)|
| 1:55:25| I think it ought to start since he's advised that committee anyhow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6925)|
| 1:55:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6930)|
| 1:55:32| Before we get over to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6932)|
| 1:55:33| I'd like to make a substitute motion to ask the law director to study this for 30 or 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6933)|
| 1:55:42| I'll say 60 just to give him time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6942)|
| 1:55:45| To look around the state, to check with CTASC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6945)|
| 1:55:48| to check with other governments to see if they're having these problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6948)|
| 1:55:53| or if they have clarified what their ethics policy is anywhere in the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6953)|
| 1:55:59| and then come back to this commission and report what you find.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6959)|
| 1:56:02| I think that's not this commission doing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6962)|
| 1:56:04| but certainly I think you have an obligation to find the truth and give us the facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6964)|
| 1:56:12| And I think that's the way we need to start if we want to clarify it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6972)|
| 1:56:17| So I'd like to make that a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6977)|
| 1:56:20| I second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6980)|
| 1:56:21| Second by Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6981)|
| 1:56:25| Do you want to go first or I'll start that end, Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6985)|
| 1:56:29| Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6989)|
| 1:56:31| The reason that I had put this on the agenda is as you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6991)|
| 1:56:37| those of us who have served on the ethics panel realize that what we have is very vague.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=6997)|
| 1:56:43| It needs clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7003)|
| 1:56:45| We need to fully understand what the policy is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7005)|
| 1:56:48| It's like if I'm going to play football, I want to know what the rules are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7008)|
| 1:56:51| And so clarifying the rules is something that this policy needs and needs desperately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7011)|
| 1:56:57| because we've just read different things about, you know, is it a violation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7017)|
| 1:57:02| Is it not a violation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7022)|
| 1:57:04| The way our policy reads now, it says what would a reasonable person conclude?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7024)|
| 1:57:11| Well, I think we're all reasonable people up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7031)|
| 1:57:13| but all 19 of us might have a different idea of what reasonable is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7033)|
| 1:57:17| But by clarifying the policy, it makes it clear what is a violation, what is not a violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7037)|
| 1:57:22| Mr. Law Director, correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7042)|
| 1:57:24| but you were quoted in the media as saying that a violation of this policy was what the majority of the ethics panel said it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7044)|
| 1:57:31| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7051)|
| 1:57:32| It takes five votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7052)|
| 1:57:33| And so I, frankly, am not comfortable with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7053)|
| 1:57:36| I feel like we need to know what the rules are, that if we can clarify those rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7056)|
| 1:57:40| that's in everyone's best interest from this body to every elected official to every employee who is affected by this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7060)|
| 1:57:49| I will say that I've talked with David Connor, who is the head of CTAS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7069)|
| 1:57:53| He has offered to help us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7073)|
| 1:57:55| He has offered to lend any assistance that we might need to help clarify and improve this policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7075)|
| 1:58:01| I've talked with Karen Echelbracht, who is a professor at the University of Tennessee who teaches ethics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7081)|
| 1:58:06| She has volunteered her time to work with us to lend any assistance that we might need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7086)|
| 1:58:14| And I would just go back to something that Mr. Smith had said, and that is we have appointed this ethics panel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7094)|
| 1:58:21| I mean, these are people that we brought forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7101)|
| 1:58:23| These are citizens who, for the most part, have agreed to serve in this manner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7103)|
| 1:58:28| and who I believe, for the most part, would be willing to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7108)|
| 1:58:31| Now, Commissioner Lambert had mentioned to me in the hallway that he had talked with Ms. Tucker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7111)|
| 1:58:35| and that Ms. Tucker had some reservations about it, and that's quite possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7115)|
| 1:58:39| I haven't talked with all nine members, primarily because Mr. Owings told us that that might be a violation of the Sunshine Law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7119)|
| 1:58:46| at our very first meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7126)|
| 1:58:48| But I do know that there are those on the panel who are willing to take on this responsibility, if you so choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7128)|
| 1:58:54| And, again, I would just point out that all we're asking through this recommendation is to bring this body a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7134)|
| 1:59:04| You can do with it what you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7144)|
| 1:59:05| You can vote it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7145)|
| 1:59:06| You can vote it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7146)|
| 1:59:07| You can amend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7147)|
| 1:59:08| You can throw it away if you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7148)|
| 1:59:10| All we're asking these people to do is to come and make a recommendation to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7150)|
| 1:59:16| Ms. Kim Waller is here, who is a member of the ethics panel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7156)|
| 1:59:19| and she called and asked if it would be appropriate for her to speak on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7159)|
| 1:59:22| And if it's appropriate, Mr. Chairman, I'd like to ask her to speak at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7162)|
| 1:59:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7166)|
| 1:59:27| Kim, if you'll come on down to the podium, let me just say a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7167)|
| 1:59:31| Just probably 45 days ago, I tried to do exactly what you were talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7171)|
| 1:59:36| You were quoted in June 19th, the Knoxville News Sentinel, saying we didn't need these 28 exemptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7176)|
| 1:59:42| And that was clarifying this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7182)|
| 1:59:44| And I have the article if you want to see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7184)|
| 1:59:46| There is a difference between exempting and clarifying and improving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7186)|
| 1:59:50| Sir, you withdrew your resolution at the last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7190)|
| 1:59:56| You did not bring it before this body for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7196)|
| 1:59:58| I was prepared to discuss at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7198)|
| 2:00:00| I was prepared to come in and make recommendations and some things that I had some issues with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7200)|
| 2:00:06| But you withdrew that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7206)|
| 2:00:08| And so when you withdrew it, it's very obvious that this policy needs to be looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7208)|
| 2:00:13| And that was when I came with this proposal to allow these citizens an opportunity to come in, look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7213)|
| 2:00:18| bring in people from outside, perhaps use Mr. Owings and his expertise, like Mr. Luthold has said, to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7218)|
| 2:00:24| But let's come up with a policy that we can present to you that's been given quite a bit of thought from a lot of different people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7224)|
| 2:00:31| But, again, you withdrew it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7231)|
| 2:00:33| You did not bring it to the floor for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7233)|
| 2:00:36| There were people in the media and you being quoted that I didn't want to bring something to this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7236)|
| 2:00:42| unless I felt that the commission wanted to deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7242)|
| 2:00:45| I think it's something that needed to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7245)|
| 2:00:47| I think we had some good clarifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7247)|
| 2:00:49| And it was pretty simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7249)|
| 2:00:50| And it was by a party outside of this government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7250)|
| 2:00:54| You're talking about using David Connors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7254)|
| 2:00:56| He works directly for commissioners in this state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7256)|
| 2:01:00| We can make a vote to do away with him if you had enough support by commissioners in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7260)|
| 2:01:07| So I think having him brought in is not using outside people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7267)|
| 2:01:12| He has just offered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7272)|
| 2:01:13| We don't necessarily have to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7273)|
| 2:01:14| But, again, why did you not bring it to the floor for discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7274)|
| 2:01:19| Because you had it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7279)|
| 2:01:20| I was prepared to deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7280)|
| 2:01:21| You voluntarily withdrew it at our last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7281)|
| 2:01:24| I certainly did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7284)|
| 2:01:25| But if you read the papers like I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7285)|
| 2:01:27| Well, I don't always read the paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7287)|
| 2:01:31| But, again, you know, if it's good policy or bad policy, it needs to be discussed regardless of what anybody thinks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7291)|
| 2:01:37| And you made another observation that we appointed these people, and we certainly did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7297)|
| 2:01:43| And I supported it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7303)|
| 2:01:45| I didn't support them for any other thing than what we gave them the charge to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7305)|
| 2:01:48| and that was to investigate ethic violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7308)|
| 2:01:51| So to say that we gave these people broad powers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7311)|
| 2:01:54| my vote certainly wasn't to give them anything other than what they were charged to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7314)|
| 2:01:57| And I appreciate all of them serving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7317)|
| 2:01:59| But my concern is not only us, the selected officials, but also teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7319)|
| 2:02:05| I mean, my daughter didn't graduate, but she got out of the fourth grade last year at A.J. Burnett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7325)|
| 2:02:11| And we take the teacher a gift at the end of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7331)|
| 2:02:14| Certainly, is that an ethics violation for a teacher to accept a gift?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7334)|
| 2:02:18| We don't know, and that's why we need it clarified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7338)|
| 2:02:20| And this is why it would be good for a body of people such as this to take a look at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7340)|
| 2:02:24| and bring recommendations here so that it is clarified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7344)|
| 2:02:27| I don't think it's this body's responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7347)|
| 2:02:30| But, Kim, if you'll go ahead and give us your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7350)|
| 2:02:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7354)|
| 2:02:35| Kim Waller, 2533 Buffett Mill Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7355)|
| 2:02:39| I'm here today speaking as an individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7359)|
| 2:02:42| I would like that to be clear from the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7362)|
| 2:02:45| I'm not speaking for anyone else on the ethics committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7365)|
| 2:02:49| and I'm certainly not speaking for the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7369)|
| 2:02:52| No one on the committee knows anything about what is in my remarks I'm about to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7372)|
| 2:02:57| I'm here to speak in favor of and to urge you to vote for Mr. Hammond's resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7377)|
| 2:03:04| In the few months that the ethics committee has been functioning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7384)|
| 2:03:07| we have received letters protesting or complaining about situations in county government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7387)|
| 2:03:13| but no letters with specific enough complaints to merit the committee's further action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7393)|
| 2:03:19| These letters do, however, point to something important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7399)|
| 2:03:23| and that is the evidence of our citizens in Knox County having a deep concern about government officials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7403)|
| 2:03:29| both elected and appointed, and the behavior of those officials in representing citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7409)|
| 2:03:35| There's also concern over government employees and how they conduct themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7415)|
| 2:03:41| We were selected to be on the committee to represent a cross-section of citizens of our county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7421)|
| 2:03:48| and I believe that as a committee we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7428)|
| 2:03:52| Commissioner Hammond's resolutions ask that the ethics committee make recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7432)|
| 2:03:57| As he said, that's all, a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7437)|
| 2:04:00| It does not ask that we set the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7440)|
| 2:04:03| Ultimately, that is up to this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7443)|
| 2:04:06| and I believe everyone on the ethics committee understands and knows that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7446)|
| 2:04:10| Taking recommendations via the ethics committee would demonstrate to our citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7450)|
| 2:04:16| that this body is serious about the issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7456)|
| 2:04:20| and that this body actually trusts the ethics committee it appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7460)|
| 2:04:24| It would demonstrate a positive and proactive step towards reassuring the public in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7464)|
| 2:04:31| As a member of the committee, I can tell you that in my observance of the committee members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7471)|
| 2:04:36| which does include two county commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7476)|
| 2:04:39| it's clear to me that we take our charge seriously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7479)|
| 2:04:43| and I don't believe any member of the committee has a hidden agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7483)|
| 2:04:47| I myself only seek to represent the constituent group I was appointed on behalf of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7487)|
| 2:04:52| which was school employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7492)|
| 2:04:55| Is that right, Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7495)|
| 2:04:58| I feel that our citizens want to voice their recommendations through the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7498)|
| 2:05:04| And as I wrap up my comments, I just want to leave you with a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7504)|
| 2:05:08| I was privileged to hear Robert Parham,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7508)|
| 2:05:12| who is the executive director of the Baptist Center for Ethics in Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7512)|
| 2:05:17| and he had a wonderful quote in a speech he gave that I heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7517)|
| 2:05:22| And he said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7522)|
| 2:05:23| Ethics is knowing the difference between what you have the right to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7523)|
| 2:05:28| and what is the right thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7528)|
| 2:05:31| I urge your support of these resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7531)|
| 2:05:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7533)|
| 2:05:34| Thank you, Kim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7534)|
| 2:05:35| Mr. Chairman, I think everyone knows how they're going to vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7535)|
| 2:05:39| so I'm not going to belabor this except to say that I think the public should understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7539)|
| 2:05:44| who we are asking to bring these recommendations before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7544)|
| 2:05:48| Reverend Ron Stewart is the chairman who is pastor of one of the largest Baptist churches in the Karnes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7548)|
| 2:05:54| and Knox County in the Karnes area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7554)|
| 2:05:56| Franklin Shanklin, who is a local business person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7556)|
| 2:05:58| Kim, who you just heard from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7558)|
| 2:05:59| Rex Davis, former member of city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7559)|
| 2:06:01| Julia Tucker, who's been on school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7561)|
| 2:06:04| Martha Phillips, who we all know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7564)|
| 2:06:07| Mike Duncan with the Knox County Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7567)|
| 2:06:10| Mr. Pingston and I are on it, and, of course, you can think what you will about myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7570)|
| 2:06:14| But I believe that these are honorable people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7574)|
| 2:06:17| and I believe that they do, as Ms. Waller said, take their charge seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7577)|
| 2:06:20| I don't think that they have hidden agendas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7580)|
| 2:06:22| They want what's best for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7582)|
| 2:06:24| They have agreed to serve on this with no pay, and they're taking some abuse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7584)|
| 2:06:28| and that's okay because that's part of it when you get into public life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7588)|
| 2:06:31| So I would just encourage you to vote to allow the Ethics Committee to make recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7591)|
| 2:06:37| Let's see what they come up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7597)|
| 2:06:38| It may be a great policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7598)|
| 2:06:40| It may be the worst policy ever in the history of county government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7600)|
| 2:06:43| But at least let's give them a chance and let them work on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7603)|
| 2:06:46| Thank you, Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7606)|
| 2:06:47| Commissioner Trammell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7607)|
| 2:06:48| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7608)|
| 2:06:49| And I agree with Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7609)|
| 2:06:51| We do need to put some teeth in this policy, but I think it needs to come from its body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7611)|
| 2:06:55| I think the Ethics Commission needs a guideline to go by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7615)|
| 2:06:59| And, you know, you can bring it up and be vilified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7619)|
| 2:07:01| but you need Mike to bring it up next time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7621)|
| 2:07:03| It may go a little far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7623)|
| 2:07:04| You just need to go to him next time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7624)|
| 2:07:05| Yeah, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7625)|
| 2:07:07| But I think that's our job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7627)|
| 2:07:09| I really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7629)|
| 2:07:10| I mean, we're in, you know, there's tough decisions that we have to make here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7630)|
| 2:07:13| and we need to make these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7633)|
| 2:07:15| You know, we need to put the rules on ourselves and have the Ethics Committee police us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7635)|
| 2:07:20| And, I mean, you can't legislate morality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7640)|
| 2:07:23| You can't put something on paper and tell people not to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7643)|
| 2:07:26| I mean, we have thousands of laws on the books and they're broken every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7646)|
| 2:07:31| You know, everybody knows their own heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7651)|
| 2:07:33| You know right from wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7653)|
| 2:07:34| You just got to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7654)|
| 2:07:35| But I think it's up to this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7655)|
| 2:07:37| I think we should, and if you want to appoint a different committee to expand on policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7657)|
| 2:07:42| and procedures that we need to follow or that county employees and officials need to follow, let's do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7662)|
| 2:07:47| and give it to the Ethics Committee and then let them go to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7667)|
| 2:07:51| But I don't think it's, I don't believe that this is exclusive to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7671)|
| 2:07:56| If you look throughout the state, I mean, the state itself is having problems with this Ethics Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7676)|
| 2:08:02| You know, it's brand new, and it's not going to come out of the gate and work perfectly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7682)|
| 2:08:06| We've got to tweak it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7686)|
| 2:08:07| We've got to work with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7687)|
| 2:08:09| And we have to, you know, listen to the citizens, to what they want, put it into policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7689)|
| 2:08:14| and then let the Ethics Commission do their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7694)|
| 2:08:17| But I think our job is to put that policy in place for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7697)|
| 2:08:22| Thank you, Commissioner Trammell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7702)|
| 2:08:23| Commissioner Cate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7703)|
| 2:08:25| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7705)|
| 2:08:27| A question and a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7707)|
| 2:08:29| Am I to understand that this would apply to all school teachers, county employees as well as?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7709)|
| 2:08:34| Every elected official and every employee in Knox County government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7714)|
| 2:08:38| I really have no problem with the Ethics Committee bringing us recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7718)|
| 2:08:42| I do think that at the same time we need to have the law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7722)|
| 2:08:46| or whoever needs to do this, maybe our staff, gather up all the policies that are in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7726)|
| 2:08:53| so we have something to look at at the same time we do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7733)|
| 2:08:59| Well, we've got a substitute motion on the floor asking the law director to, over the next 60 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7739)|
| 2:09:05| check around the state and come up and see what other counties are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7745)|
| 2:09:08| And with CTASC and our association along with their association, I mean, I'm sure there's people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7748)|
| 2:09:14| As I sit on the Board of Directors for Tennessee County Commissioners Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7754)|
| 2:09:18| I hear commissioners from across the state dealing with the same issues that we are dealing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7758)|
| 2:09:23| And they're saying, you know, what do we need to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7763)|
| 2:09:25| Well, maybe we need to get CTASC, the one that came up with this policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7765)|
| 2:09:28| to go back and revise it for all of the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7768)|
| 2:09:31| Maybe they're already doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7771)|
| 2:09:34| You know, I just think we get in a big hurry around this community whenever the newspaper says we're doing something wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7774)|
| 2:09:40| that we try to do a knee-jerk reaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7780)|
| 2:09:42| And most of the time we end up in a worse situation than we've got right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7782)|
| 2:09:47| So let's just slow down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7787)|
| 2:09:49| You know, like Commissioner Trammell says, you're not going to legislate people to have good ethics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7789)|
| 2:09:54| Either you've got them or you don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7794)|
| 2:09:56| And I think, for the most part, people in Knox County have good ethics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7796)|
| 2:10:01| I think all this started in Nashville with some people breaking laws, not just ethic violations, but broke the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7801)|
| 2:10:07| I mean, when you take $800,000 in contract money, I mean, I'm sure that they wasn't really concerned about an ethics policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7807)|
| 2:10:14| even if they'd had one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7814)|
| 2:10:16| The FBI took care of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7816)|
| 2:10:18| And they'll do us the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7818)|
| 2:10:20| So, Commissioner Norman or Commissioner Cameron.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7820)|
| 2:10:23| Let me make sure I understand the parliamentary situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7823)|
| 2:10:26| If we want to gather up all this information from other places, we need to vote for the substitute motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7826)|
| 2:10:33| which kills the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7833)|
| 2:10:35| Well, yes, it will kill the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7835)|
| 2:10:38| But they can bring it back to us and we can decide what to do with it then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7838)|
| 2:10:41| Maybe we do need somebody to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7841)|
| 2:10:43| But let's get the information to see what everybody else is doing around the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7843)|
| 2:10:46| It doesn't hurt to take 60 days to study something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7846)|
| 2:10:49| And ask the law director to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7849)|
| 2:10:51| I mean, can't we combine these some way and get both things started at the same time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7851)|
| 2:10:55| Well, don't you need the information before you set out somebody having a charge to do something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7855)|
| 2:10:59| Because we're going to be expanding something that the state didn't really set up to give them authority to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7859)|
| 2:11:04| Even though we can give them the authority, wouldn't we rather have the information to look at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7864)|
| 2:11:09| They may come back from CTAS and have a policy that looks good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7869)|
| 2:11:13| I mean, I'm still struggling with the law director's instructions why Miss Waller| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7873)|
| 2:11:16| and everybody else can't just bring us some recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7876)|
| 2:11:19| But that's over my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7879)|
| 2:11:21| Well, in my opinion, whatever the policy comes out is that our local newspaper would be all over it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7881)|
| 2:11:28| and the commissioners who vote against it would be very bad commissioners, that we don't care about people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7888)|
| 2:11:33| And I just think that's unfair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7893)|
| 2:11:36| And I'm not going to be put in a situation like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7896)|
| 2:11:38| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7898)|
| 2:11:40| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7900)|
| 2:11:43| I'm kind of new at this public service job that I've been elected to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7903)|
| 2:11:50| But certainly it's become apparent to me that there's a huge issue of public trust, mistrust in this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7910)|
| 2:12:00| And I'm certainly, I have no fear whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7920)|
| 2:12:07| And I notice that there's hardly been a person on this body that has not been slammed by the newspaper for one reason or another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7927)|
| 2:12:17| And I have no fear of what's going to come from an ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7937)|
| 2:12:25| I would be amazed, and I am amazed, that an ethics committee, that a group of people will try to take on this task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7945)|
| 2:12:34| It will be, and it is, a very difficult task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7954)|
| 2:12:40| And you acknowledge that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7960)|
| 2:12:42| Several of you, Commissioner Lambert, Commissioner Moore, we know it is going to be very difficult to define and clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7962)|
| 2:12:51| But I have no problem whatsoever with anybody that wants to attempt this and give us guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7971)|
| 2:12:57| I'm looking for guidance all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7977)|
| 2:13:04| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7984)|
| 2:13:06| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7986)|
| 2:13:09| What we're looking at here is the very fact that our community cares about ethics, and that's marvelous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7989)|
| 2:13:18| We have an ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7998)|
| 2:13:19| And all we're asking them to do, as Commissioner Hammond has pointed out, is make a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=7999)|
| 2:13:23| And make it by November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8003)|
| 2:13:24| That's not a hurry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8004)|
| 2:13:27| That's reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8007)|
| 2:13:28| That gives plenty of time for the law director, for you, me, CTAS, anyone else to send information to help them make a better recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8008)|
| 2:13:39| And furthermore, we are free to amend, deny, ignore that recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8019)|
| 2:13:47| I'm not afraid of the newspaper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8027)|
| 2:13:48| I'm not afraid of public criticism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8028)|
| 2:13:50| I am afraid that the substitute motion before us is really an effort to defer, delay, and deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8030)|
| 2:13:58| And let's not do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8038)|
| 2:14:00| We can walk and chew gum at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8040)|
| 2:14:02| If the law director wants us to compile good ethics codes and send them over to the commission, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8042)|
| 2:14:08| That doesn't mean we should delay this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8048)|
| 2:14:11| We've been delaying our consideration of ethics long enough, and the community demands better of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8051)|
| 2:14:16| That's why we need to defeat the substitute motion and pass the original.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8056)|
| 2:14:20| Thank you, Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8060)|
| 2:14:22| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8062)|
| 2:14:24| I don't even understand why we have to vote on this to send it to the ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8064)|
| 2:14:30| I served with Commissioner Hammond there, and I think we sent a letter here not too long ago asking the commission to look at something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8070)|
| 2:14:36| Why couldn't we have not just come up with this without it coming for a commission and asking the commission to vote on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8076)|
| 2:14:42| Why could we not come up with some changes we recommend?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8082)|
| 2:14:45| Now, Commissioner Hammond sits on that committee with me, and I've told him several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8085)|
| 2:14:50| Paul, will you pull that mic close to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8090)|
| 2:14:52| I can't even hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8092)|
| 2:14:53| I've told him several times that we need to determine what an ineptitism policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8093)|
| 2:14:57| And I get no backing on the ethics committee, none whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8097)|
| 2:15:01| I believe I understood Commissioner Hammond to say at one of the meetings that those 28 things you had put on there would weaken it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8101)|
| 2:15:09| Now, maybe I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8109)|
| 2:15:10| I may be wrong on that part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8110)|
| 2:15:12| Like I say, I said I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8112)|
| 2:15:13| I never made that statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8113)|
| 2:15:14| But, Commissioner Hammond, you've heard me say several times that we need to determine what an ineptitism is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8114)|
| 2:15:19| and send it to the commission, and you have never backed me on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8119)|
| 2:15:22| but yet you come down here asking the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8122)|
| 2:15:24| I believe this is grandstanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8124)|
| 2:15:26| And I have concerns right now with our ethics committee, and I'll tell you what the concerns I've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8126)|
| 2:15:31| We get these letters from the public out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8131)|
| 2:15:34| They're not supposed to be knowledgeable to anybody but the chairman and the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8134)|
| 2:15:41| And then they are presented to us at the meeting, and we discuss them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8141)|
| 2:15:44| These letters have been leaked out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8144)|
| 2:15:46| and people are defending themselves before the people on the ethics committee even know what the letters say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8146)|
| 2:15:51| before we get the letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8151)|
| 2:15:52| So I'm determined about the ethics of the ethics committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8152)|
| 2:15:55| and that will be brought up at the ethics committee before long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8155)|
| 2:15:59| Now, when somebody comes down here and defending what's said in a letter that I don't even know that the ethics committee got,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8159)|
| 2:16:06| that's wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8166)|
| 2:16:09| And I believe, if I'm not mistaken, Commissioner Hammond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8169)|
| 2:16:11| were these letters supposed to go to the ethics committee chairman only,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8171)|
| 2:16:15| and then he takes them to the law director to see if there is probable cause there for us to talk about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8175)|
| 2:16:23| Mr. Law Director, our procedure is that the complaints go to a certain P.O. box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8183)|
| 2:16:31| They're mailed to the P.O. box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8191)|
| 2:16:32| The chair of the committee, which is Dr. Stewart, reviews those complaints to see if they are credible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8192)|
| 2:16:39| And he makes that determination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8199)|
| 2:16:41| If they are credible, he sends me a copy of the complaint prior to the meeting for my review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8201)|
| 2:16:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8207)|
| 2:16:48| But nobody on the ethics committee gets that letter until that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8208)|
| 2:16:52| That's the way we've been receiving them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8212)|
| 2:16:53| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8213)|
| 2:16:54| Not until the meeting, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8214)|
| 2:16:56| How is this getting out about who we're talking about going to be investigating when the committee members don't even know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8216)|
| 2:17:03| So we need to investigate the ethics of the ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8223)|
| 2:17:12| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8232)|
| 2:17:16| Mr. Chairman, I want to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8236)|
| 2:17:18| Mr. Hammond, I applaud you for doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8238)|
| 2:17:23| Yeah, you went out on your own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8243)|
| 2:17:26| I applaud your leadership in what you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8246)|
| 2:17:29| There's some difference on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8249)|
| 2:17:30| Some people are for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8250)|
| 2:17:31| Some are against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8251)|
| 2:17:34| You know, folks, it's time Knox County moved forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8254)|
| 2:17:36| There's so many things that this body has put aside, put aside, put aside, put aside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8256)|
| 2:17:39| Guys and women, we've got work to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8259)|
| 2:17:41| And this is one of the things we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8261)|
| 2:17:43| Now, if we come back and let's say there's 28 things, Mike, that you all do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8263)|
| 2:17:48| Mike, this is for the law director, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8268)|
| 2:17:50| Say they come back with 28 things the ethics committee says to do, and we adopt that for six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8270)|
| 2:17:55| Then, Mr. Law Director, if the state comes by in six months and now here's something statewide, we just follow on that plan, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8275)|
| 2:18:03| Well, I mean, right now we don't have any requirements by the state of what exactly to put in a policy, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8283)|
| 2:18:15| What the state did, they passed enabling legislation, which, as part of that legislation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8295)|
| 2:18:20| they said the county technical assistance service, CTAS, you come up with a policy that all 95 counties can adopt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8300)|
| 2:18:28| They said the same thing to MTAS for all the cities in the state of Tennessee that they could adopt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8308)|
| 2:18:33| The policies are very similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8313)|
| 2:18:36| What we did, this commission adopted the CTAS policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8316)|
| 2:18:42| We've changed that policy one time, and that was in the makeup of the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8322)|
| 2:18:49| All policies have to be on file or you have to notify the state as of July 1 of this year, of 07,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8329)|
| 2:18:59| of whether you have just adopted the CTAS policy or whether you have adopted a policy of your own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8339)|
| 2:19:07| If you've adopted the CTAS policy, all you were required to do was to notify the state that you had done so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8347)|
| 2:19:15| We have sent the state a copy of our policy because we amended it to address the makeup of the body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8355)|
| 2:19:23| and how that body is selected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8363)|
| 2:19:27| So our policy is on file with the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8367)|
| 2:19:30| I would imagine if other counties have adopted policies that are somewhat different from CTAS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8370)|
| 2:19:37| their policies should be on file with the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8377)|
| 2:19:40| If they weren't on file by the state by July 1, then, according to the legislation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8380)|
| 2:19:45| their legislative body was subject to ouster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8385)|
| 2:19:49| So they should be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8389)|
| 2:19:51| You know, here's the way I look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8391)|
| 2:19:55| All of Knox County is looking at us right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8395)|
| 2:19:57| And I appreciate your leadership, Mr. Hammond, in doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8397)|
| 2:20:01| You know, folks, I'll say it before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8401)|
| 2:20:04| I waited a long time to be a commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8404)|
| 2:20:06| I worked hard to be a commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8406)|
| 2:20:08| And I'm proud to be a commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8408)|
| 2:20:10| But right now we're the laughing stock of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8410)|
| 2:20:12| And I want to move this body forward and let's do what's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8412)|
| 2:20:16| Guys, this is only recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8416)|
| 2:20:18| If we don't like them, then turn it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8418)|
| 2:20:20| What are you afraid of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8420)|
| 2:20:23| Larry, Commissioner Smith, let me say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8423)|
| 2:20:24| This is not only about this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8424)|
| 2:20:26| This is about the sheriff and the sheriff's employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8426)|
| 2:20:28| This is about every elected official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8428)|
| 2:20:30| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8430)|
| 2:20:31| And every employee in Knox County government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8431)|
| 2:20:33| And if they don't like it, then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8433)|
| 2:20:34| These people don't have a charge to do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8434)|
| 2:20:37| We're elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8437)|
| 2:20:38| And people elected us to take care of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8438)|
| 2:20:41| And if they don't like the way we do business, every four years they get a chance to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8441)|
| 2:20:45| you all didn't do what we wanted to get done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8445)|
| 2:20:47| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8447)|
| 2:20:48| These people have to answer to no one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8448)|
| 2:20:50| They're not elected by their citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8450)|
| 2:20:53| Scott, if they come up with, say, 16, 17 things and we approve of 15, then we're the final one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8453)|
| 2:20:59| Larry, then the paper, the new Sentinel that has us sued right now, that obviously has a vendetta against us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8459)|
| 2:21:06| Jack McElroy is going to say in his editorials that we're unethical because we didn't approve the one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8466)|
| 2:21:14| I'll take that chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8474)|
| 2:21:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8476)|
| 2:21:17| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8477)|
| 2:21:18| Just finally, Mr. Chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8478)|
| 2:21:20| I'd just like to remind the folks, my fellow colleagues, that I will be under the same guidelines that you will be when this is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8480)|
| 2:21:30| if indeed you vote to move forward to allow the committee to bring forward these recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8490)|
| 2:21:35| So I'm under no grand delusions that I'm going to be exempt from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8495)|
| 2:21:40| I'm under the same guidelines and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8500)|
| 2:21:42| I am a defendant in this lawsuit, just like everybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8502)|
| 2:21:45| I have been accused of violating the law, and I will be defending myself through the law director when we go to court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8505)|
| 2:21:52| if indeed we do go to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8512)|
| 2:21:54| So I'm well aware of the fact that I'm putting myself under this as well, that I'm not in any way trying to exempt myself from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8514)|
| 2:22:03| Let me just say simply this, that with CTAS, the state organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8523)|
| 2:22:09| what they did was they came up with a proposal that would be good for the entire state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8529)|
| 2:22:15| We in Knox County, we're unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8535)|
| 2:22:18| We have our own ways of doing things here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8538)|
| 2:22:21| Our people voted for charter government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8541)|
| 2:22:24| They said we want to have say-so on how we do things here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8544)|
| 2:22:29| What may be good for O'Brien County and Wheatley County may not be the best thing for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8549)|
| 2:22:35| That's why I think that a Knox County policy made by Knox County residents and voted on by this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8555)|
| 2:22:42| is a step in the right direction toward giving us a good, strong ethics policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8562)|
| 2:22:47| What's wrong with a good, strong ethics policy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8567)|
| 2:22:49| I think we would all agree, nothing, as long as everyone understands the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8569)|
| 2:22:53| A wise man told me once, it doesn't matter what the rules are as long as everybody understands the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8573)|
| 2:22:57| Where we are right now, not everybody understands the rules because what is and what is not a violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8577)|
| 2:23:03| This is what we're attempting to do is let's clarify it, let's look at it, let's have you vote on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8583)|
| 2:23:08| and determine and tell us exactly what that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8588)|
| 2:23:12| I think I would also be remiss if I didn't respond to Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8592)|
| 2:23:16| Let me say that I've known Paul a long time, and Mr. Pinkston, I have a lot of respect for you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8596)|
| 2:23:21| and have a lot of respect for your brother and what you've done for the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8601)|
| 2:23:27| Say what you will about me, and I know that I've been looked at and am being looked at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8607)|
| 2:23:32| and all of this other, that's just the nature of politics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8612)|
| 2:23:35| But, you know, you have Reverend Stewart and Mr. Shanklin and Ms. Waller and all the people that I just met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8615)|
| 2:23:39| These are private citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8619)|
| 2:23:41| And if we have something specific, then let's be specific about who needs to be investigated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8621)|
| 2:23:48| But to have a broad statement of the ethics committee needs to have their ethics looked at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8628)|
| 2:23:54| without them here to even respond or even specific types of allegations, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8634)|
| 2:23:59| I would just really encourage us as members of the ethics committee to be cautious in our statements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8639)|
| 2:24:09| particularly about our private citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8649)|
| 2:24:11| Again, they have accepted to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8651)|
| 2:24:13| It's not like third grade dodgeball where they were standing up and saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8653)|
| 2:24:17| Pick me, pick me, I can't wait to be picked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8657)|
| 2:24:20| They're doing this because we asked them to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8660)|
| 2:24:22| And they're doing it because they want to serve and they feel like this is a worthwhile endeavor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8662)|
| 2:24:27| They're not getting paid a dime to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8667)|
| 2:24:30| And they've already had, you know, their integrity questioned, and now they're having it questioned again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8670)|
| 2:24:35| I would just encourage us to really be cautious about using those kinds of statements about our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8675)|
| 2:24:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8681)|
| 2:24:42| First of all, I didn't call any names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8682)|
| 2:24:45| Did you see the letter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8685)|
| 2:24:49| The letter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8689)|
| 2:24:50| Yeah, where a certain person was accused of ethics and where he defended it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8690)|
| 2:24:56| violations that they wanted us to check into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8696)|
| 2:24:59| Did you see the letter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8699)|
| 2:25:00| The only letters I've seen are those that came in our meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8700)|
| 2:25:02| I mean, if there's something other than the meeting, I haven't seen it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8702)|
| 2:25:04| On July the 6th, when we, the ethics committee, had a special meeting down here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8704)|
| 2:25:09| did you see those letters that someone came up and defended theirself at before that July the 6th meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8709)|
| 2:25:15| You're talking about the mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8715)|
| 2:25:16| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8716)|
| 2:25:17| You want to call his name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8717)|
| 2:25:18| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8718)|
| 2:25:19| We had, no, I mean, yes, I saw the letters that came in, and they were made public, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8719)|
| 2:25:25| I responded to a letter in the Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8725)|
| 2:25:27| Now, hang on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8727)|
| 2:25:28| We've got to have some civil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8728)|
| 2:25:30| Well, and this gentleman just stepped over the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8730)|
| 2:25:32| Well, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8732)|
| 2:25:33| I responded to a letter in the Knoxville News Sentinel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8733)|
| 2:25:36| I didn't know we were investigating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8736)|
| 2:25:37| I didn't have any idea you were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8737)|
| 2:25:39| Well, it's odd that you vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8739)|
| 2:25:40| That's what you vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8740)|
| 2:25:41| Well, it's odd that you vote on things when you're the poster child for nepotism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8741)|
| 2:25:44| Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8744)|
| 2:25:45| If you want a nepotism policy, I'll recommend one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8745)|
| 2:25:46| Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8746)|
| 2:25:49| We need to, you know, we need to get the commissioners and then we can ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8749)|
| 2:25:52| Mr. Hammond, the only thing I'm saying is we asked for this at the ethics committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8752)|
| 2:25:57| and while you did not pick the ball up and go with some of this, instead of coming and asking the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8757)|
| 2:26:03| I'm going to vote for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8763)|
| 2:26:04| I'm not scared of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8764)|
| 2:26:05| I'm going to vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8765)|
| 2:26:06| But what I'm saying is why did you not follow when I asked the ethics committee to come up with some policies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8766)|
| 2:26:13| and you did not carry the ball there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8773)|
| 2:26:16| And this has been a discussion that we've had is what is the authority of the ethics committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8776)|
| 2:26:22| And during our discussions, we have said we did not know if we had the authority to do this or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8782)|
| 2:26:26| This is why we wrote a letter about nepotism, asking them to address nepotism at the appropriate time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8786)|
| 2:26:32| and we all signed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8792)|
| 2:26:34| And so this is why I brought it before this committee was to give us the okay, give us the authority, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8794)|
| 2:26:42| I don't know if the authority is the right word, to go ahead and proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8802)|
| 2:26:45| Now, if we vote it down, then they're not going to proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8805)|
| 2:26:47| But I know that some members of the committee, myself included,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8807)|
| 2:26:50| were a bit hesitant to just take the ball and run with it without some type of direction and guidance from this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8810)|
| 2:26:55| I don't think we're a separate body, the ethics committee and this commission here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8815)|
| 2:26:58| I think we could have come up with it and just sent it down here and asked them to look at it like we did the nepotism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8818)|
| 2:27:03| That's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8823)|
| 2:27:04| That don't mean they're going to vote for it, but I'll vote for sending this because I'm on the ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8824)|
| 2:27:09| And I appreciate it, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8829)|
| 2:27:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8831)|
| 2:27:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8832)|
| 2:27:14| Commissioner Lambert and Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8834)|
| 2:27:17| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8837)|
| 2:27:20| Mike, I just talked to Julia Tucker, and she said that you all did not discuss sending this to county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8840)|
| 2:27:29| Now, here's what I'm concerned about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8849)|
| 2:27:30| You said you and certain members of the ethics committee were for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8850)|
| 2:27:34| Did you have conversations with folks on the ethics committee about bringing this before commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8854)|
| 2:27:40| We did not because, as I stated earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8860)|
| 2:27:42| our law director had informed us at our very first meeting not to have conversations with one another for possible violations of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8862)|
| 2:27:48| sunshine law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8868)|
| 2:27:49| Mr. Stewart, Mr. Stewart was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8869)|
| 2:27:51| We just had another member of the ethics committee come up and speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8871)|
| 2:27:55| How did she decide to come up and speak to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8875)|
| 2:27:58| Because she called me and asked if it would be appropriate for her to come and speak, and I told her, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8878)|
| 2:28:02| She called you, but you just said to my previous question that you had not had a conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8882)|
| 2:28:08| with anyone on the ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8888)|
| 2:28:10| Now, which is the truth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8890)|
| 2:28:11| Did you have a conversation with her, or did you not have a conversation with her?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8891)|
| 2:28:15| Yeah, the short answer is yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8895)|
| 2:28:17| I had a conversation with her about coming down, but did we talk about this policy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8897)|
| 2:28:21| You called and said, I want to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8901)|
| 2:28:23| May I come and speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8903)|
| 2:28:24| And I said, sure, I'd love to have you come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8904)|
| 2:28:25| Did we speak about this policy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8905)|
| 2:28:27| My interpretation of the sunshine law is not that you violated the sunshine law, but it just seems awful funny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8907)|
| 2:28:34| Why didn't you bring this to the ethics committee and vote with your ethics committee of, hey, let's us as a committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8914)|
| 2:28:41| send this to county commission asking for this charge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8921)|
| 2:28:45| Why did you do it on your own and you say there's some that support it, yet you also say you haven't had conversations with them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8925)|
| 2:28:52| It sounds to me like a few of you guys have gotten aside and decided that you're going to ask for this power,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8932)|
| 2:28:58| something that you didn't discuss in your committee with your other members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8938)|
| 2:29:03| Well, Mr. Lambert, I would agree with you that you and I have a disagreement on what the sunshine law says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8943)|
| 2:29:08| We didn't get together and have lunch, and we didn't get together and do all of the things that has been reported that other people have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8948)|
| 2:29:17| But let me also say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8957)|
| 2:29:18| If you have an allegation against me that I am not being truthful before this committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8958)|
| 2:29:24| you have an obligation to take it to the attorney general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8964)|
| 2:29:28| You have an obligation to bring it before the ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8968)|
| 2:29:31| You have an obligation to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8971)|
| 2:29:32| You have made that statement here today, and you have an obligation to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8972)|
| 2:29:37| and I am very happy to do it in open meeting, on television, and doing all of the things that I need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8977)|
| 2:29:42| Mike, I'm not saying that you did anything wrong when you had conversations with people of the ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8982)|
| 2:29:47| I haven't had conversations with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8987)|
| 2:29:49| I'm not saying that the pot's calling the kettle black here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8989)|
| 2:29:51| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8991)|
| 2:29:52| Ms. Waller asked if she could appear, and that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8992)|
| 2:29:53| And that's the only conversation that I've had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8993)|
| 2:29:56| Again, if he feels that he's done so, I challenge you to bring me up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=8996)|
| 2:30:01| I'm more than happy to meet with anybody, anywhere, anytime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9001)|
| 2:30:04| I contend you didn't do anything wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9004)|
| 2:30:06| and I contend that you know that the rest of us, if we have a conversation, aren't doing anything wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9006)|
| 2:30:13| Your grandstanding is. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9013)|
| 2:30:15| I think I'm going to call for the question because I think everybody here knows how they're going to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9015)|
| 2:30:20| So the first thing we're voting on is a substitute motion to defer it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9020)|
| 2:30:23| or send it to the law director to check it out throughout the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9023)|
| 2:30:28| and come back with a recommendation or his recommendation of what should be done in 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9028)|
| 2:30:33| So I guess we ought to take a roll call because I'm sure there will be four in again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9033)|
| 2:30:37| So we'll start in the Ninth District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9037)|
| 2:30:40| Commissioner Pinkston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9040)|
| 2:30:41| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9041)|
| 2:30:43| Commissioner Green?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9043)|
| 2:30:44| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9044)|
| 2:30:45| Commissioner Huddleston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9045)|
| 2:30:46| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9046)|
| 2:30:47| Commissioner Ballard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9047)|
| 2:30:48| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9048)|
| 2:30:49| Commissioner Moore?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9049)|
| 2:30:50| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9050)|
| 2:30:51| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9051)|
| 2:30:52| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9052)|
| 2:30:53| Commissioner Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9053)|
| 2:30:54| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9054)|
| 2:30:55| Commissioner Kaywood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9055)|
| 2:30:57| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9057)|
| 2:30:58| Commissioner Frank Luthod?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9058)|
| 2:31:00| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9060)|
| 2:31:01| Commissioner Craig Luthod?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9061)|
| 2:31:03| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9063)|
| 2:31:04| Commissioner Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9064)|
| 2:31:05| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9065)|
| 2:31:06| Commissioner Trammell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9066)|
| 2:31:07| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9067)|
| 2:31:08| Commissioner Cate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9068)|
| 2:31:10| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9070)|
| 2:31:12| Commissioner Ivan Harmon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9072)|
| 2:31:14| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9074)|
| 2:31:15| Commissioner Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9075)|
| 2:31:17| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9077)|
| 2:31:18| Mr. Bellis. Aye. Mr. Mark Harmon. No. Mr. Strickland. No. Mr. Jordan. No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9078)|
| 2:31:29| Okay, the substitute motion fails with 13 no's and 6 ayes. So we're back on the original| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9089)|
| 2:31:43| motion. Mr. Chairman, I have a substitute motion I'd like to try. Okay, Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9103)|
| 2:31:47| Cate. I don't see why we can't go down both of these roads at one time. I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9107)|
| 2:31:56| and Commissioner Hammond and I have had this discussion, that we need to empower this committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9116)|
| 2:32:00| formally to do anything. Some agree and some don't. Ms. Waller, if we just said to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9120)|
| 2:32:06| Ethics Committee, would you guys go work on a policy and bring us the recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9126)|
| 2:32:11| I would assume that you all would do that. One. Two, at the same time, we could be gathering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9131)|
| 2:32:17| information from across the state and have it all at one time, so we could look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9137)|
| 2:32:23| And I'll make that in the form of a motion. Second. Clarification, Mr. Chairman. So Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9143)|
| 2:32:28| Cate's motion is to simply add to the existing motion that the law director should gather| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9148)|
| 2:32:32| information on ethics codes around the state? Yes. Well, it is to send to the Ethics Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9152)|
| 2:32:38| a request to look at some things. They don't need to, I don't think the term empowerment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9158)|
| 2:32:43| or anything like that needs to be used. That's the current motion, to have them look at these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9163)|
| 2:32:49| matters and come back in November. The resolution says to empower them in some way, and I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9169)|
| 2:32:54| know what that means. That's a big difference. Speak to it. It says here, I think, instructing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9174)|
| 2:33:05| we're instructing the Ethics Panel to make. Requesting the Ethics Committee to send us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9185)|
| 2:33:12| recommendations if they so desire. Of course, we'd have to vote on them. The law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9192)|
| 2:33:19| would like to speak about it. First of all, I represent this body and I represent the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9199)|
| 2:33:26| Ethics Committee as well, and advise the Ethics Committee. And certainly, as part of my duties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9206)|
| 2:33:31| in advising the Ethics Committee, if you instruct them to review and make recommendations regarding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9211)|
| 2:33:39| improvements or clarifications to the policy, the first thing I'm going to do is to go and see what the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9219)|
| 2:33:46| counties have done in the state. So, you know, with that said, I want them to have full knowledge of what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9226)|
| 2:33:52| everybody else has done. I have some other information, too, I'd be glad to share with the Ethics Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9232)|
| 2:33:58| and I'm sure we'll talk about it, if they are empowered to study it and review it. Right now, as we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9238)|
| 2:34:09| talked about on many occasions, I do not believe that they have the power to make recommendations to this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9249)|
| 2:34:18| to spend their time doing that. There's nothing within their authority that grants them that power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9258)|
| 2:34:29| So that's why this matter is brought before this body, is to give them the opportunity to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9269)|
| 2:34:35| Basically, the jurisdiction, the power, the authority to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9275)|
| 2:34:40| That's quite a responsibility for the Ethics Committee. That's quite a bit of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9280)|
| 2:34:45| And I think it just takes more. It certainly takes an act of this body in order to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9285)|
| 2:35:01| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9301)|
| 2:35:03| Let me withdraw that if we're going to have a legal battle about it. I mean, I just don't get it, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9303)|
| 2:35:09| These are citizens of this county that pay taxes. Anybody can walk to that microphone and say anything to us they want to, I thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9309)|

| 2:36:19| I don't go out and do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9379)|
