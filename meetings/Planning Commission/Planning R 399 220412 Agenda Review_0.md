| 0:00:30| Good morning, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=30)|
| 0:00:31| Welcome to the April meeting of the agenda review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=31)|
| 0:00:37| We have a few commissioners that will not be here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=37)|
| 0:00:40| but most will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=40)|
| 0:00:42| At this point, I'll turn it over to Director Brooks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=42)|
| 0:00:45| and then we'll go over the agenda items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=45)|
| 0:00:48| for consideration on Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=48)|
| 0:00:52| Good morning, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=52)|
| 0:00:53| Everyone hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=53)|
| 0:00:54| Here we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=54)|
| 0:00:56| I'm just going to give you a few updates from our staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=56)|
| 0:00:59| and I wanted to call your attention to two new resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=59)|
| 0:01:04| that our information services staff created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=64)|
| 0:01:07| They're in front of you here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=67)|
| 0:01:09| They were created with the intent of taking them to the City of Knoxville's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=69)|
| 0:01:13| Neighborhood Conference, which I'll talk about here in just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=73)|
| 0:01:15| But those of you who might be aware, we have had a full page of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=75)|
| 0:01:20| how to work together, and it's for developers and community members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=80)|
| 0:01:23| So we've created what they call a RACCAR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=83)|
| 0:01:26| which we'll be taking to meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=86)|
| 0:01:28| And if you all attend any meetings and want to bring these with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=88)|
| 0:01:32| or share them with your neighbors, we would be happy to provide those for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=92)|
| 0:01:37| And we also have a snapshot of all of our great tools that we have on our website| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=97)|
| 0:01:41| as well as reports, recent reports that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=101)|
| 0:01:44| that we've created over the last year or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=104)|
| 0:01:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=109)|
| 0:01:50| So speaking of the Neighborhood Conference, after a two-year break,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=110)|
| 0:01:54| the City of Knoxville's Neighborhood Conference reconvened the last weekend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=114)|
| 0:01:59| and planning and our TPO staff participated with two information booths,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=119)|
| 0:02:04| as we have in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=124)|
| 0:02:06| And for those of you, some of you probably attended the meetings in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=126)|
| 0:02:10| but the intent of the conference is to bring together community groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=130)|
| 0:02:14| residents, elected officials, and different departments in the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=134)|
| 0:02:20| to meet one another, exchange ideas, share resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=140)|
| 0:02:24| And there's workshops that are led by citizens as well as local officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=144)|
| 0:02:29| to teach community groups how to navigate city government services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=149)|
| 0:02:32| and how to work better together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=152)|
| 0:02:38| Our staff had a lot of great conversations related to hillside protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=158)|
| 0:02:42| commuting options, lots of questions about cat service and housing in general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=162)|
| 0:02:48| including tiny homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=168)|
| 0:02:50| And then it was a great opportunity for our staff to highlight some of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=170)|
| 0:02:53| online tools that we've developed over the last couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=173)|
| 0:02:59| Last week, we had our first round of community input for Advanced Knox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=179)|
| 0:03:05| It was called Ideas Week, and it was held from March 27th through the 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=185)|
| 0:03:11| But even though that is concluded, we still have an online component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=191)|
| 0:03:15| So all the activities that were offered at that in-person events earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=195)|
| 0:03:22| are available on our website at advancedknox.org.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=202)|
| 0:03:25| And I think you all received an email from me last week about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=205)|
| 0:03:27| so I encourage you all to share it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=207)|
| 0:03:29| And we'll have that remaining open until April 22nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=209)|
| 0:03:33| We had about 250 participants in seven in-person and one online meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=213)|
| 0:03:38| during that week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=218)|
| 0:03:40| And as of yesterday morning, we had about 112 unique online participants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=220)|
| 0:03:45| and over 365 comments on the online map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=225)|
| 0:03:50| So, again, I encourage you all, if you haven't already participated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=230)|
| 0:03:53| please go online and do so and share it out with your friends and colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=233)|
| 0:03:57| We really want to get as much input as possible throughout this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=237)|
| 0:04:04| We have two CAT studies underway that our TPO staff are working on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=244)|
| 0:04:09| CAT Reimagined held two in-person events last week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=249)|
| 0:04:12| and will hold a virtual event tonight at 6 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=252)|
| 0:04:16| And this study is looking at CAT's current bus network| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=256)|
| 0:04:19| and is exploring ways to make it better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=259)|
| 0:04:22| as well as asking the questions of what routes are needed to operate differently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=262)|
| 0:04:26| and does their service currently provide equity and access to all communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=266)|
| 0:04:31| Thank you, Liz, for pulling these up on the screen here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=271)|
| 0:04:34| But this is CAT's website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=274)|
| 0:04:36| I encourage you all to take a look and participate in the survey, catreimagined.com.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=276)|
| 0:04:46| And that concludes my staff updates for this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=286)|
| 0:04:51| If anyone has any questions, I'd be happy to retain those now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=291)|
| 0:04:56| If not, we'll move into the review of agenda items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=296)|
| 0:05:03| Okay, item number eight, under rezoning and plan amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=303)|
| 0:05:06| This is rezoning and two plan amendments, one one-year plan and sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=306)|
| 0:05:11| for Hopeful Housing Huber Properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=311)|
| 0:05:14| And Liz is going to review this for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=314)|
| 0:05:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=316)|
| 0:05:19| So this is in the Inskip community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=319)|
| 0:05:21| This is west of Bruin Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=321)|
| 0:05:23| It's across from the Inskip Park and Pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=323)|
| 0:05:26| It's presently in an area that's zoned RN1, adjacent to RN2 zoning and RN4 zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=326)|
| 0:05:35| The applicant is requesting to go to RN5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=335)|
| 0:05:40| To do this, they also need a one-year plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=340)|
| 0:05:43| and they are asking for medium-density residential slash office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=343)|
| 0:05:48| They also need a sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=348)|
| 0:05:51| So that would be from low-density residential to medium-density residential slash office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=351)|
| 0:05:59| This is a 4.6-acre area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=359)|
| 0:06:02| It's also near the commercial node of Bruin Road and Dutch Valley Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=362)|
| 0:06:08| We'll look at that a little bit more here in a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=368)|
| 0:06:11| Here's what the sector plan and one-year plan looks like for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=371)|
| 0:06:17| You can see the commercial node just a little bit to the south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=377)|
| 0:06:24| This is what transit and the major road plan looks like in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=384)|
| 0:06:28| You can see that there is a CAT bus line that goes down, sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=388)|
| 0:06:34| this Dutch Valley Road at this location, and it also goes down Rita Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=394)|
| 0:06:43| So it's CAT bus route, I think, 20 and 24 that sort of service this commercial node.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=403)|
| 0:06:54| When we look at the land use classification table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=414)|
| 0:06:58| the classification table notes that MDRO should be near community parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=418)|
| 0:07:04| or community commercial office nodes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=424)|
| 0:07:07| It also notes that it should be near a transitional or it should be part of a transitional area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=427)|
| 0:07:13| because of its proximity to low-density residential and commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=433)|
| 0:07:19| It should also be a relatively flat site, and it should also be served by transit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=439)|
| 0:07:25| or in areas proposed to be served by transit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=445)|
| 0:07:29| So this location actually meets all of that criteria for the medium-density residential slash office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=449)|
| 0:07:36| You can see here in this bird's eye view of the area a little bit more clearly the adjacency to the park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=456)|
| 0:07:43| and to the commercial and office uses down along Dutch Valley Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=463)|
| 0:07:53| The orange areas on the map are also presently multifamily developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=473)|
| 0:08:03| This is the difference between the RN-4 and the RN-5, in case you were wondering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=483)|
| 0:08:09| There's not a huge difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=489)|
| 0:08:11| The RN-4 does require 40,000 square foot lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=491)|
| 0:08:16| so they could potentially get five lots in this area to accommodate multifamily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=496)|
| 0:08:23| The difference between the two is probably about 30 dwelling units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=503)|
| 0:08:31| and staff is recommending approval of RN-5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=511)|
| 0:08:36| We're also recommending approval of MDR-0 for both the sector plan and the one-year plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=516)|
| 0:08:42| because it is compatible with the surrounding area and meets the location criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=522)|
| 0:08:49| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=529)|
| 0:08:59| There are some sidewalks in the general area, not in front of this parcel currently, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=539)|
| 0:09:05| and there are recommendations that are in the NSCIP small area plan for sidewalk improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=545)|
| 0:09:11| and pedestrian improvements in this area as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=551)|
| 0:09:15| Is there any RN-5 in that area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=555)|
| 0:09:18| Let's zoom out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=558)|
| 0:09:20| There is across actually here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=560)|
| 0:09:23| I'll just show you on this map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=563)|
| 0:09:25| The Christenberry Heights over here is RN-5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=565)|
| 0:09:29| It's just on the other side of the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=569)|
| 0:09:32| Let me turn this little laser on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=572)|
| 0:09:36| Over here, this is RN-5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=576)|
| 0:09:41| There's also some RN-5 to the north as well, along East NSCIP Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=581)|
| 0:09:50| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=590)|
| 0:09:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=596)|
| 0:09:57| Thank you, Liz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=597)|
| 0:09:58| We'll move on to item number 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=598)|
| 0:10:00| This is 4E22RZ, Jerry Price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=600)|
| 0:10:03| Sorry, I think Scott Smith had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=603)|
| 0:10:06| Yeah, I just was this – I remember this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=606)|
| 0:10:08| This is a property that I think that Wendt Bourgeois owned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=608)|
| 0:10:13| and that he came up because I think there was a rezoning of that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=613)|
| 0:10:18| and he claimed he didn't get notified, and it was a down-zoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=618)|
| 0:10:22| I think that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=622)|
| 0:10:23| You could say years ago he got down-zoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=623)|
| 0:10:26| Yeah, I remember when he came before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=626)|
| 0:10:30| This was a number of years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=630)|
| 0:10:31| but there was a general rezoning in this area that the city pursued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=631)|
| 0:10:34| It was zoned RB previously, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=634)|
| 0:10:36| I'm not 100% – I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=636)|
| 0:10:37| It was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=637)|
| 0:10:38| I think it was zoned R2 because it's in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=638)|
| 0:10:45| and it was recommended to be rezoned, I believe, to R1A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=645)|
| 0:10:50| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=650)|
| 0:10:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=651)|
| 0:10:52| So this is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=652)|
| 0:10:53| This may make him whole or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=653)|
| 0:10:56| I guess potentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=656)|
| 0:10:59| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=659)|
| 0:11:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=661)|
| 0:11:02| Going on to item number 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=662)|
| 0:11:04| It's along John Sevier Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=664)|
| 0:11:06| You all have a revised staff report in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=666)|
| 0:11:10| It was a minor clarification that we had to make to this report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=670)|
| 0:11:14| to reference to the 500-year floodplain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=674)|
| 0:11:17| Liz will review this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=677)|
| 0:11:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=679)|
| 0:11:20| So this is an application for a 17.5-acre area adjacent to the French Broad River| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=680)|
| 0:11:26| and along the John Sevier Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=686)|
| 0:11:30| It's currently zoned agriculture, which allows one dwelling unit per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=690)|
| 0:11:34| and they're requesting to go to planned residential up to five dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=694)|
| 0:11:40| It's in the planned growth area of the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=700)|
| 0:11:45| This is what the sector plan looks like for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=705)|
| 0:11:48| You can see that it shows up as low-density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=708)|
| 0:11:51| with some hillside protection and steep –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=711)|
| 0:11:55| or hillside protection and stream protection overlays| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=715)|
| 0:11:59| along the northern portion of the property that abuts the French Broad River.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=719)|
| 0:12:09| And staff is recommending approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=729)|
| 0:12:12| but we are reducing our recommendation for density to three dwelling units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=732)|
| 0:12:19| and we're also recommending two conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=739)|
| 0:12:22| because of the John Sevier Scenic Highway Corridor Study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=742)|
| 0:12:26| that was done a few years ago for this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=746)|
| 0:12:29| and we are inserting one condition that says to maintain a tree buffer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=749)|
| 0:12:35| with a 50-foot depth along John Sevier Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=755)|
| 0:12:40| and also to have no clearing and grading during –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=760)|
| 0:12:45| until an approved concept plan or use on review plan is reviewed by this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=765)|
| 0:12:54| Other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=774)|
| 0:12:57| Yeah, I didn't – I was just – this one kind of confused me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=777)|
| 0:13:01| This is a property that the slope analysis shows 17 acres at five units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=781)|
| 0:13:08| It's a pretty flat piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=788)|
| 0:13:10| It's on a major road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=790)|
| 0:13:14| You know, the mine – they have a rock quarry on the other side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=794)|
| 0:13:19| a utility treatment plant kind of –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=799)|
| 0:13:22| why would we not get an LDR sector plan in planned growth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=802)|
| 0:13:26| Why would we stick – it seems like five units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=806)|
| 0:13:29| if it's appropriate anywhere, might be appropriate here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=809)|
| 0:13:33| I think if you look at what's happening in this area currently, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=813)|
| 0:13:38| Serenity River is really the only subdivision that's been built out in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=818)|
| 0:13:43| so it's generally much larger lots still.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=823)|
| 0:13:46| I mean, I know that the Veterans Cemetery shows up as planned residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=826)|
| 0:13:50| but that's obviously a cemetery, not residential development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=830)|
| 0:13:57| I think there's some question about utility service in this area too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=837)|
| 0:14:03| So I do believe it goes – at least wastewater goes to Serenity River,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=843)|
| 0:14:08| but I don't know if it goes beyond that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=848)|
| 0:14:10| I think they would probably need to figure that out during the use on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=850)|
| 0:14:14| concept plan stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=854)|
| 0:14:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=857)|
| 0:14:20| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=860)|
| 0:14:21| It just seemed like that would be a good place, but I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=861)|
| 0:14:30| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=870)|
| 0:14:33| How does it relate to this other – is this a plat?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=873)|
| 0:14:39| That little parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=879)|
| 0:14:41| Oh, the one that's across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=881)|
| 0:14:43| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=883)|
| 0:14:44| It's, like, adjacent to it along the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=884)|
| 0:14:46| It shows up as a case on the planning map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=886)|
| 0:14:49| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=889)|
| 0:14:52| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=892)|
| 0:14:55| I probably will have to zoom out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=895)|
| 0:14:57| Are you sure you don't mean the one that is across John Sevier Highway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=897)|
| 0:15:02| There's one next to the – like, up against the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=902)|
| 0:15:05| Actually, it's, like, right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=905)|
| 0:15:08| I believe that plat is – they're fixing an access issue to one of the properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=908)|
| 0:15:16| The properties themselves won't change along the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=916)|
| 0:15:18| I think they're just fixing the access to a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=918)|
| 0:15:23| It's kind of – it's all kind of related to this project, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=923)|
| 0:15:25| rezoning and selling this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=925)|
| 0:15:28| It's not incorporated into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=928)|
| 0:15:29| It's just for the access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=929)|
| 0:15:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=932)|
| 0:15:51| Let's move on to item number 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=951)|
| 0:15:54| Dennis Patterson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=954)|
| 0:15:57| This is on the west side of Maynardville Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=957)|
| 0:16:00| It's between Loyston Road and Old Maynardville Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=960)|
| 0:16:04| This is an area of old CA zoning out in the county in a very rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=964)|
| 0:16:11| It's probably been here since at least the 1980s, if not before, zoned CA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=971)|
| 0:16:17| The sector plan did recognize this area as rural commercial, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=977)|
| 0:16:23| because it's in the rural area of the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=983)|
| 0:16:28| And because of that reason, CA is not recommended in the rural area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=988)|
| 0:16:36| nor is CA zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=996)|
| 0:16:39| So staff is recommending an expansion of the rural commercial sector plan area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=999)|
| 0:16:49| and then we are also recommending, instead of the CA zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1009)|
| 0:16:54| rural commercial zoning at this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1014)|
| 0:16:57| You can see some of the other uses that are occurring in this area in the CA zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1017)|
| 0:17:06| There's not really any major landscaping that's happening to sort of protect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1026)|
| 0:17:11| the surrounding rural land uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1031)|
| 0:17:14| If we look at where it's at in the county, it's all the way north here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1034)|
| 0:17:20| the border with Union County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1040)|
| 0:17:24| While there is CA zoning there, staff recommends if the commercial zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1044)|
| 0:17:28| is expanded that it should be rural commercial zoning because it does intend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1048)|
| 0:17:34| for limited retail and service-oriented uses for outlined rural areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1054)|
| 0:17:40| and it also requires landscaping to maximize compatibility between the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1060)|
| 0:17:47| commercial uses and the surrounding rural areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1067)|
| 0:17:54| Are there questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1074)|
| 0:17:58| This looks like an expansion of an existing business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1078)|
| 0:18:02| I mean, not for sure, but it kind of looks that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1082)|
| 0:18:06| So you say that landscaping would be required in the additional area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1086)|
| 0:18:10| that they're picking up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1090)|
| 0:18:12| Where the rural commercial zoning is located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1092)|
| 0:18:18| And what is required in rural commercial for landscaping?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1098)|
| 0:18:22| For the landscaping?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1102)|
| 0:18:23| I'll have to pull up that section of the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1103)|
| 0:18:27| But there's some buffering and screening for parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1107)|
| 0:18:30| and outdoor storage areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1110)|
| 0:18:34| Any other specifics I can pull up if you'd like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1114)|
| 0:18:56| So the existing business is zone CA, right, to the north?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1136)|
| 0:19:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1141)|
| 0:19:02| That whole little node up there is zoned CA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1142)|
| 0:19:07| And would RC allow the uses that are currently occurring at CA property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1147)|
| 0:19:18| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1158)|
| 0:19:27| So without knowing for sure what they're doing at that location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1167)|
| 0:19:30| that would be a good question for the applicant if they're asking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1170)|
| 0:19:34| and intending to expand their business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1174)|
| 0:19:37| But there's retail sales that are allowed in CR that include farm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1177)|
| 0:19:44| equipment supplies, nurseries, soils and mulch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1184)|
| 0:19:51| fueling service stations with or without convenience stores,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1191)|

| 0:20:05| And then there is a landscaping, side yard setback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1205)|
| 0:20:10| and landscaping section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1210)|
| 0:20:13| And then landscaping requirements as well in the front yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1213)|
| 0:20:18| And I can read these to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1218)|
| 0:20:22| The required front yard must contain a minimum of one native tree capable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1222)|
| 0:20:26| of reaching 50 feet in height at maturity per every 50 feet or portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1226)|

| 0:20:34| They have street frontage on three sides of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1234)|
| 0:20:39| The native shade trees must be spaced a minimum of 50 feet apart at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1239)|

| 0:20:45| One ornamental tree is required every 25 feet of linear street frontage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1245)|
| 0:20:52| And then there are different regulations for the side yard setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1252)|
| 0:20:57| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1257)|
| 0:21:07| Seeing no more questions, let's move on to item number 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1267)|
| 0:21:13| It's the rezoning and plan amendment I-75 land partners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1273)|
| 0:21:17| and the Gibbs community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1277)|
| 0:21:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1280)|
| 0:21:21| This is on the west side of Thompson School Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1281)|
| 0:21:24| This is northwest of Carnes Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1284)|
| 0:21:27| Applicant is requesting to go from the existing agricultural zoning to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1287)|
| 0:21:31| planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1291)|
| 0:21:33| They're asking for up to five dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1293)|
| 0:21:37| They're also asking for a sector plan amendment from agriculture and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1297)|
| 0:21:41| hillside protection and stream protection to low-density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1301)|
| 0:21:47| and hillside protection and stream protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1307)|
| 0:21:50| This is a 108-acre area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1310)|
| 0:21:53| It's in the rural area of the growth policy plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1313)|
| 0:21:55| but it is adjacent to the planned growth area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1315)|
| 0:22:00| Just for reference, this is where the planned growth area stops and where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1320)|
| 0:22:08| it becomes the rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1328)|
| 0:22:10| So it's adjacent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1330)|
| 0:22:14| There is a stream on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1334)|
| 0:22:16| On the rear portion of the property there are forested hillsides with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1336)|
| 0:22:23| some steep slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1343)|
| 0:22:26| There is some floodway on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1346)|
| 0:22:30| This is a slope map that just shows where some of the HP areas are on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1350)|
| 0:22:36| the property as well as where some of the FEMA floodway area is and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1356)|
| 0:22:42| floodplain designations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1362)|
| 0:22:50| So why are we cutting back to three units per acre from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1370)|
| 0:22:53| recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1373)|
| 0:22:55| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1375)|
| 0:22:56| So staff is recommending, well, sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1376)|
| 0:23:00| let me just say that over the last 20 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1380)|
| 0:23:02| rezonings in this area have been in the range of four dwelling units per| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1382)|
| 0:23:06| acre, but because this is in the rural area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1386)|
| 0:23:10| it's constrained by steep slopes and floodplain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1390)|
| 0:23:13| staff is recommending up to two dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1393)|
| 0:23:17| also consistent with the rural residential sector plan classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1397)|
| 0:23:22| A traffic impact study was done, or sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1402)|
| 0:23:25| traffic impact letter was submitted as part of this rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1405)|
| 0:23:28| so further analysis will be required of some of the roads in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1408)|
| 0:23:35| The traffic impact letter did note a deficiency in the width of Carnes Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1415)|
| 0:23:42| which is probably the likely cut through to get over to the Gibbs School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1422)|
| 0:23:46| area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1426)|
| 0:23:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1428)|
| 0:23:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1429)|
| 0:23:50| This is what I'm trying to get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1430)|
| 0:23:51| When I look at the slope analysis on this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1431)|
| 0:23:54| the non-hillside area is allocated two units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1434)|
| 0:24:01| And on the one I just brought up on John Sevier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1441)|
| 0:24:04| the non-hillside was allocated at five units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1444)|
| 0:24:08| And again, we've talked about this before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1448)|
| 0:24:11| but I'm trying to understand how to predict where we end up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1451)|
| 0:24:16| because it would seem that everything around us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1456)|
| 0:24:19| I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1459)|
| 0:24:20| there is some element of the growth policy plan that comes into play,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1460)|
| 0:24:23| too, which, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1463)|
| 0:24:24| Which you still can do up to three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1464)|
| 0:24:28| The growth policy plan with sewer and adjoining LDR, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1468)|
| 0:24:34| I think in this sector plan, I believe it's rural residential is up to two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1474)|
| 0:24:42| I think it's three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1482)|
| 0:24:43| Under the growth policy plan, up to three with a traffic impact analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1483)|
| 0:24:47| You can consider three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1487)|
| 0:24:48| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1488)|
| 0:24:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1489)|
| 0:24:50| So, but still, if this is a slope analysis, should we, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1490)|
| 0:24:55| shouldn't we just consider this based on the slopes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1495)|
| 0:24:59| I mean, if you're going to allocate the flat stuff out at two units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1499)|
| 0:25:05| it doesn't, I don't know, I don't get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1505)|
| 0:25:08| We can run this and show you what it would look like with the five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1508)|
| 0:25:12| and the non-hillside, and we'll share that out with you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1512)|
| 0:25:15| I'm not, yeah, I'm not saying anybody's not doing something right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1515)|
| 0:25:19| I'm just trying to understand the way we should be able to predict| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1519)|
| 0:25:23| how this is used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1523)|
| 0:25:25| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1525)|
| 0:25:26| Well, and we've talked about this before because it's so ambiguous,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1526)|
| 0:25:30| basically, the way it appears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1530)|
| 0:25:32| It may or may not be actually when you all are thinking about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1532)|
| 0:25:35| but it appears that somebody outside looking in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1535)|
| 0:25:38| you've got five units on a flat on one and the other one are two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1538)|
| 0:25:41| and it just appears like we're kind of making an effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1541)|
| 0:25:44| to bring the density down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1544)|
| 0:25:47| Again, we'll rerun this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1547)|
| 0:25:49| In the hillside ridge top plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1549)|
| 0:25:50| when you look at this chart that's included in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1550)|
| 0:25:53| it does identify the non-hillside as up to five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1553)|
| 0:25:57| So we can share that information with you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1557)|
| 0:26:00| so it can help inform the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1560)|
| 0:26:03| The other thing, everything that has been developed out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1563)|
| 0:26:05| has been developed at four and a quarter or four or four and a quarter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1565)|
| 0:26:11| It's been developed in PR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1571)|
| 0:26:12| Everything else is still agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1572)|
| 0:26:16| I mean, and I've said this before to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1576)|
| 0:26:19| when we're talking about density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1579)|
| 0:26:20| we're talking about population moving here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1580)|
| 0:26:23| Somehow we've got to have some responsible density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1583)|
| 0:26:30| Can you, when you are sharing that back to us with the different densities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1590)|
| 0:26:37| I think that one of the things that introduces a sense of ambiguity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1597)|
| 0:26:41| is that each one of these cases has different context| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1601)|
| 0:26:46| in terms of what is around it, the area that it's in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1606)|
| 0:26:49| not just the zoning, but what are the other build-outs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1609)|
| 0:26:52| So we're never comparing an apple to an apple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1612)|
| 0:26:56| There's always this changing context,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1616)|
| 0:27:00| which I think makes it feel different case to case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1620)|
| 0:27:05| and you're looking for that absolute, and it can be tricky to get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1625)|
| 0:27:18| I would agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1638)|
| 0:27:19| All I'm saying is that for the purposes of a slope analysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1639)|
| 0:27:24| we should consider the slope, and we shouldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1644)|
| 0:27:29| Otherwise, you're just going to use other conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1649)|
| 0:27:34| to inject into a slope analysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1654)|
| 0:27:37| and it's not really focused on the slopes, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1657)|
| 0:27:41| I found that slope analysis a few years back was consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1661)|
| 0:27:47| all across different parts of the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1667)|
| 0:27:49| and I found it came up with some pretty accurate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1669)|
| 0:27:52| and at the end of the day, it was pretty accurate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1672)|
| 0:27:54| the numbers you ended up being able to actually use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1674)|
| 0:27:58| Anyone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1678)|
| 0:28:05| Okay, let's move on to item number 26.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1685)|
| 0:28:07| This is another rezoning and plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1687)|
| 0:28:09| along the John Speer Highway corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1689)|
| 0:28:12| Liz is going to cover this one as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1692)|
| 0:28:15| I appreciate Liz covering all of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1695)|
| 0:28:17| We have had a staff member who's been out this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1697)|
| 0:28:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1705)|
| 0:28:26| Okay, so this is in the area across John Speer Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1706)|
| 0:28:31| from the other rezoning that we looked at earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1711)|
| 0:28:34| It's a smaller tract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1714)|
| 0:28:37| and there are some constraints on the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1717)|
| 0:28:40| related to easements that are on the site currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1720)|
| 0:28:46| It is 2.91 acres, and it shows up as agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1726)|
| 0:28:52| Again, this is another place where this side of the highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1732)|
| 0:28:55| is in the rural area of the growth policy plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1735)|
| 0:28:59| while the other side of the highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1739)|
| 0:29:00| is in the planned growth area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1740)|
| 0:29:05| The sector plan classification for this area is agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1745)|
| 0:29:12| There are no steep slopes on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1752)|
| 0:29:17| Staff is recommending up to, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1757)|
| 0:29:22| two dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1762)|
| 0:29:24| We're also recommending rural residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1764)|
| 0:29:27| Part of the reason for that, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1767)|
| 0:29:30| are these constraints related to this easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1770)|
| 0:29:35| that's on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1775)|
| 0:29:37| It takes up quite a bit of area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1777)|
| 0:29:40| and again, that's what our recommendation is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1780)|
| 0:29:44| We're also inserting three conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1784)|
| 0:29:48| and because this one does not have a buffered tree yard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1788)|
| 0:29:53| that exists currently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1793)|
| 0:29:55| we are hoping that they will preserve a 50-foot depth buffer yard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1795)|
| 0:30:01| along the frontage of the roadway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1801)|
| 0:30:04| so that future tree planting could occur,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1804)|
| 0:30:09| and that would roll with the concept plan and use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1809)|
| 0:30:17| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1817)|
| 0:30:28| Thank you, Liz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1828)|
| 0:30:32| We can switch it over to Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1832)|
| 0:30:39| We're looking at item number 33, the Morning Ridge subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1839)|
| 0:30:42| This request is for a 57-lot subdivision on Ball Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1842)|
| 0:30:46| and we'll share with you the highlights of this request with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1846)|
| 0:31:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1860)|
| 0:31:01| This one was postponed last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1861)|
| 0:31:04| Part of the reasons here in a sec,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1864)|
| 0:31:08| but I just want to first just make sure everybody understands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1868)|
| 0:31:11| where this one's located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1871)|
| 0:31:13| So this property is on the north side of Ball Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1873)|
| 0:31:16| If you see this little dashed line coming through here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1876)|
| 0:31:18| this is where Shod Road extension is coming through soon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1878)|
| 0:31:23| and the Oak Ridge Highway and so on is off to the east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1883)|
| 0:31:31| And from a zoning perspective, it's predominantly ag in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1891)|
| 0:31:36| There's RA on both sides of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1896)|
| 0:31:39| This property is rezoned to PR up to $3 billion per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1899)|
| 0:31:42| and around the area where Shod Road is coming in is an area where PC zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1902)|
| 0:31:47| is located, so it's not too far away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1907)|
| 0:31:52| So going to the changes since last month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1912)|
| 0:31:57| they provided a preliminary grading plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1917)|
| 0:32:00| They have now provided how much area they anticipate disturbing within the HP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1920)|
| 0:32:04| area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1924)|
| 0:32:06| They're providing additional privacy fencing on the south| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1926)|
| 0:32:09| and west sides of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1929)|
| 0:32:11| They're asking for additional peripheral setback reductions to 25 feet along the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1931)|
| 0:32:15| west property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1935)|
| 0:32:17| In reality, it's along the entire boundary of the development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1937)|
| 0:32:20| but this is a new part of the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1940)|
| 0:32:24| And they're providing locations where they anticipate having basement-style| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1944)|
| 0:32:29| houses, and this is kind of important for how their grading plan works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1949)|
| 0:32:35| So just a reminder that the backside of this property is the really steep part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1955)|
| 0:32:40| where it goes up to the top of the ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1960)|
| 0:32:44| This is where we wanted them to show how much grading they're going to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1964)|
| 0:32:49| because their previous plan did not have the proper location of the hillside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1969)|
| 0:32:55| protection area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1975)|
| 0:32:56| As you can see here, this was the old plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1976)|
| 0:32:58| They showed the hillside protection area north of their cul-de-sac.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1978)|
| 0:33:03| On their new plan, you can see that they've modified their cul-de-sac.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1983)|
| 0:33:07| It's just a T turnaround now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1987)|
| 0:33:09| But the green area is the hillside area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1989)|
| 0:33:13| The hillside protection plan recommends up to 2.6 acres of disturbance in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1993)|
| 0:33:18| HP area, and they're proposing 1.97 acres of disturbance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=1998)|
| 0:33:24| which you can see in the red area is what their proposed disturbance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2004)|
| 0:33:28| into the hillside area is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2008)|
| 0:33:32| So they are asking for a 25-foot peripheral setback,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2012)|
| 0:33:35| so the standard 35 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2015)|
| 0:33:37| The dashed red lines indicate where they're proposing an 8-foot-tall privacy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2017)|
| 0:33:41| fence around the exterior of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2021)|
| 0:33:43| so basically in the rear yards of all the lots that back up to another property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2023)|
| 0:33:48| including on the west, which is new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2028)|
| 0:33:50| The previous plan did have the privacy fence on the east side of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2030)|
| 0:33:58| And I just wanted to point out where they're – so where we see orange boxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2038)|
| 0:34:02| on here is where they're proposing basement houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2042)|
| 0:34:08| You can see that there's quite a bit of grading on these properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2048)|
| 0:34:14| It's actually – a lot of these are higher up than the adjacent property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2054)|
| 0:34:17| That's why there's a walk-out basement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2057)|
| 0:34:20| But I just wanted to point out that while they are showing a privacy fence along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2060)|
| 0:34:24| the adjacent properties, I'm not sure how much they're going to do to screen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2064)|
| 0:34:31| the houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2071)|
| 0:34:33| Just as a point of reference, this point here, the first floor elevation of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2073)|
| 0:34:40| house will be about 17 feet higher than this adjacent property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2080)|
| 0:34:44| So, I mean, the basement level will be screened with the privacy fence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2084)|
| 0:34:50| but really the house will be substantially higher than the adjacent property will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2090)|
| 0:34:54| And the same thing on the north side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2094)|
| 0:34:56| At this point, the first floor of this house is about 13 feet higher than the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2096)|
| 0:35:00| adjacent property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2100)|
| 0:35:06| Anybody have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2106)|
| 0:35:12| Any way we can get the road widths down to something a little more reasonable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2112)|
| 0:35:16| than 25 feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2116)|
| 0:35:18| Well, on this one they are proposing a 25-foot wide road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2118)|
| 0:35:21| I mean, it's not much different than the 26.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2121)|
| 0:35:25| They do have – this is a private road, so it's not a public road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2125)|
| 0:35:30| They are proposing a 40-foot wide right-of-way instead of a 50-foot right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2130)|
| 0:35:36| But if they get much lower than that, it's going to – it would probably be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2136)|
| 0:35:40| challenging to have anybody park on the street and get cars through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2140)|
| 0:35:44| But, I mean, it's a private road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2144)|
| 0:35:46| They could request it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2146)|
| 0:35:47| It would be less of a concern in this case than it would be if it was a public road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2147)|
| 0:35:52| If they came in asking for 22 feet, would that be considered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2152)|
| 0:35:56| They could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2156)|
| 0:35:58| How serious they considered it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2158)|
| 0:36:01| You can ask if they were interested in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2161)|
| 0:36:04| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2164)|
| 0:36:05| They never requested anything less than what they proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2165)|
| 0:36:10| I mean, I think for a private drive, a loop like that, 25 feet is excessive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2170)|
| 0:36:16| in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2176)|
| 0:36:19| Hey, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2179)|
| 0:36:21| These lower – you're saying those are basement lots and the slope goes up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2181)|
| 0:36:26| No, it's going down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2186)|
| 0:36:27| So is there any pad backyard at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2187)|
| 0:36:30| I mean, it looks like it falls from the –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2190)|
| 0:36:31| Well, I think their grading plan is probably not very representative of what the final| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2191)|
| 0:36:36| final is going to be when the houses go in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2196)|
| 0:36:38| I think they're showing it probably more like it's an onslaught house without the basement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2198)|
| 0:36:44| because with the – I'm assuming – I'm just going to make an assumption that they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2204)|
| 0:36:47| going to be walkout basements because of how much topography change there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2207)|
| 0:36:52| So if that's the case, it'll look different when it's finally constructed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2212)|
| 0:36:57| I think these – they do show quite a bit of topography, like the tailpole lines between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2217)|
| 0:37:03| the houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2223)|
| 0:37:04| So they are trying to bring that grade down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2224)|
| 0:37:07| But, you know, these are so high that there's a good chance, I guess, these could be just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2227)|
| 0:37:12| a slope in their backyard down to the fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2232)|
| 0:37:14| I mean, normally you'd have at least 10 feet for a patio or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2234)|
| 0:37:17| I just didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2237)|
| 0:37:18| It looks like it from the – okay, it falls just straight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2238)|
| 0:37:21| Yeah, that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2241)|
| 0:37:23| Maybe it's a sleeting or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2243)|
| 0:37:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2252)|
| 0:37:33| Mike, do you want to move on to item number 38?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2253)|
| 0:37:37| Concept use on review for Gallagher Ferry Field Division.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2257)|
| 0:37:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2259)|
| 0:37:41| So, yeah, this is the West Gallagher Ferry Subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2261)|
| 0:37:44| It's on Hickory Creek Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2264)|
| 0:37:47| It's west of the terminus of Hardin Valley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2267)|
| 0:37:53| There was a revision to the staff report modifying condition number three to include language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2273)|
| 0:38:03| that says that all offsite road improvements are to be completed before the first phase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2283)|
| 0:38:09| of the subdivision is plotted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2289)|
| 0:38:12| And that's part of the condition related to improvements to the West Gallagher Ferry Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2292)|
| 0:38:22| implementing the requirements of the Transportation Impact Study and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2302)|
| 0:38:29| So, as I mentioned just now, there is a realignment proposed as part of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2309)|
| 0:38:35| Gallagher Ferry Subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2315)|
| 0:38:37| I'm just going to kind of step through the major points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2317)|
| 0:38:39| But the sidewalk is being proposed down to Hickory Creek Road intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2319)|
| 0:38:45| There's quite a few losses up front on West Gallagher Ferry Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2325)|
| 0:38:48| which is something we've been kind of worried about and working with the applicant on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2328)|
| 0:38:53| Disturbance in the hillside protection area is within the recommended limits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2333)|
| 0:38:56| and they aren't proposing a stub out road to adjacent properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2336)|
| 0:39:00| but I'll kind of explain that a little bit more to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2340)|
| 0:39:03| So the realignment of West Gallagher Ferry, you can see in blue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2343)|
| 0:39:06| is essentially what the existing road is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2346)|
| 0:39:08| It comes in at an angle to Hickory Creek Road, which is not ideal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2348)|
| 0:39:12| As part of this project, they're able to create a proper 90-degree intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2352)|
| 0:39:19| with Hickory Creek, introduce a new horizontal curve here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2359)|
| 0:39:23| and then increase the radius of an existing sharper turn in the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2363)|
| 0:39:31| They're also going to be lowering the road in this general area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2371)|
| 0:39:35| just south of their proposed access point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2375)|
| 0:39:38| I'll show you right here real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2378)|
| 0:39:42| So this is how they're going to be changing that vertical curve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2382)|
| 0:39:46| Right now the road is the dashed line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2386)|
| 0:39:49| As you can see, this is the new access point, the new road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2389)|
| 0:39:53| If they need 300 feet of sight distance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2393)|
| 0:39:57| if they can't get it right now without lowering the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2397)|
| 0:40:02| their sight distance goes right through the hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2402)|
| 0:40:05| So they have to lower the road, do some grading along the edge of their property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2405)|
| 0:40:08| to get that sight distance to 300 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2408)|
| 0:40:13| Going back, so they will need a sight distance easement along Hickory Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2413)|
| 0:40:19| It goes through Lot 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2419)|
| 0:40:23| All these lots in orange are the ones that will have access directly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2423)|
| 0:40:27| to West Gallagher Ferry, the realigned West Gallagher Ferry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2427)|
| 0:40:32| The road itself will be widened to 22 feet wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2432)|
| 0:40:35| It's less than what we would typically see at 26,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2435)|
| 0:40:38| but being that this is a through street, it's not part of the subdivision street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2438)|
| 0:40:42| we don't want it 26 because we don't want people parking on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2442)|
| 0:40:46| We want to encourage people to park off the road on the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2446)|
| 0:40:51| We're also requiring, or there's a recommended condition to require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2451)|
| 0:40:55| that all these lots have to have an on-site turnaround for safety reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2455)|
| 0:41:08| The applicant provided this map that shows how much grading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2468)|
| 0:41:12| they're going to be doing within the hillside protection area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2472)|
| 0:41:15| Everything you see in red here will be graded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2475)|
| 0:41:18| as well in this back left corner of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2478)|
| 0:41:23| but they are staying within their limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2483)|
| 0:41:25| They're allowed 7.99.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2485)|
| 0:41:28| I'm sorry, there's 7.99 acres within the hillside protection area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2488)|
| 0:41:33| and they're serving 7.24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2493)|
| 0:41:38| I think I'd have to look it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2498)|
| 0:41:40| What they're allowed is just a little bit more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2500)|
| 0:41:45| I can look it up if needed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2505)|
| 0:41:46| but I think it was something like 92% of the area they were allowed to serve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2506)|
| 0:41:49| and they're only disturbing like 90% to 91% of the HP area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2509)|
| 0:41:55| You can see on the right, it's predominantly all green,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2515)|
| 0:41:59| which is those 0% to 15% grade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2519)|
| 0:42:01| with only a little bit of 15% to 25% grade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2521)|
| 0:42:04| so it's actually not too steep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2524)|
| 0:42:08| How do you classify West Gallagher?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2528)|
| 0:42:10| Do you use a collector?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2530)|
| 0:42:12| Well, actually, it is a local street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2532)|
| 0:42:15| In the transportation impact study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2535)|
| 0:42:17| the engineer did say that even though it is a local street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2537)|
| 0:42:20| it acts more like a collector, so I think it's fair to treat it similarly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2540)|
| 0:42:27| If this was a true collector street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2547)|
| 0:42:30| onsite turnarounds would be required during the permitting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2550)|
| 0:42:36| We wouldn't need a condition to require the onsite turnaround,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2556)|
| 0:42:39| but in this case it makes sense because of the horizontal curves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2559)|
| 0:42:42| and the vertical curves in the road that all these lots have onsite turnarounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2562)|
| 0:42:51| I'll just point out that there's not a lot of great opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2571)|
| 0:42:55| for future road connections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2575)|
| 0:42:56| so staff's not recommending any stub-outs in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2576)|
| 0:43:00| There is a fairly large property to the north| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2580)|
| 0:43:02| that also has a fairly large sinkhole on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2582)|
| 0:43:05| so everything you see here that's circled in kind of that orange color,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2585)|
| 0:43:08| that's a sinkhole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2588)|
| 0:43:11| So we just don't believe there's a great opportunity for stub-outs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2591)|
| 0:43:15| The property to the west is pretty small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2595)|
| 0:43:19| It's already a residential house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2599)|
| 0:43:21| There is a fairly good-sized property to the northwest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2601)|
| 0:43:26| That one is pretty well built out already with some significant improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2606)|
| 0:43:30| so it could always be developed at some point in time with more intensity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2610)|
| 0:43:35| but at this point I don't really see that happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2615)|
| 0:43:39| So we're not recommending any stub-outs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2619)|
| 0:43:41| I just want to point that out because I know it's been a point of –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2621)|
| 0:43:45| so that's something we're trying to make sure that we evaluate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2625)|
| 0:43:48| and make recommendations on when appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2628)|
| 0:43:55| Does anybody have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2635)|
| 0:44:05| Thank you, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2645)|
| 0:44:07| Well, that is all the items that staff has identified to discuss today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2647)|
| 0:44:10| Is there anything else that any of the commissioners have questions on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2650)|
| 0:44:16| Yeah, I've got a question on item number 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2656)|
| 0:44:20| On which one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2660)|
| 0:44:21| 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2661)|
| 0:44:23| Hold on, I had it pulled up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2663)|
| 0:44:29| 4J22SP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2669)|
| 0:44:35| The Knoxville College one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2675)|
| 0:44:38| 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2678)|
| 0:44:39| Agenda item 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2679)|
| 0:44:46| They have requested postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2686)|
| 0:44:50| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2690)|
| 0:44:51| They have not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220412-agenda-review?start=2691)|
