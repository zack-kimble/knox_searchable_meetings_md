| 0:01:00| Okay, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=60)|
| 0:01:03| This morning I'm really excited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=63)|
| 0:01:04| We have Dr. Liz Norton, who's the Assistant Superintendent of Strategy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=64)|
| 0:01:09| and she's going to go over our annual plan and quarterly report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=69)|
| 0:01:12| I know the board members did hear this the past month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=72)|
| 0:01:15| but I'm really excited that we have this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=75)|
| 0:01:17| We've got this data now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=77)|
| 0:01:18| That's really focused around our four priorities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=78)|
| 0:01:21| and I love that our superintendent has these four priorities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=81)|
| 0:01:24| which we'll go over, and the staff is doing a tremendous job just focusing on these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=84)|
| 0:01:32| creating these action items, and being real intentional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=92)|
| 0:01:35| So welcome, Dr. Liz Norton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=95)|
| 0:01:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=97)|
| 0:01:39| The first thing I want to do is just talk through briefly how the quarterly plan is laid out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=99)|
| 0:01:44| and sort of the intentions behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=104)|
| 0:01:46| So what we did was we took the annual plan and the metrics there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=106)|
| 0:01:50| and thought about which metrics would be most critical to look at at different points in time in the year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=110)|
| 0:01:57| and when we would need to report out on them based on when the data rolls in on our calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=117)|
| 0:02:03| So the report is laid out around the four priorities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=123)|
| 0:02:06| so you'll notice that each one of those four priorities is represented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=126)|
| 0:02:10| It starts with sort of a narrative around what the work is looking like in the field,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=130)|
| 0:02:15| a little story around how that's playing out, what you might see if you went into a school or a classroom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=135)|
| 0:02:21| and then the data for that priority is on the corresponding page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=141)|
| 0:02:27| So you'll notice the very first page,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=147)|
| 0:02:30| we have just some general updates around some of the work that's been happening at this point in the school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=150)|
| 0:02:37| We've opened Mill Creek, and we just had the launch of the Bright Steps initiative with the United Way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=157)|
| 0:02:43| and then our HR team has been working to revise our principal recruitment process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=163)|
| 0:02:49| as well as has started an early hiring process for teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=169)|
| 0:02:54| so trying to work to make sure that we're prepared to fill vacancies moving into the next school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=174)|
| 0:03:00| The next section you'll see is our excellence in foundational skills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=180)|
| 0:03:04| So for foundational skills for us, that is both early literacy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=184)|
| 0:03:08| so really thinking about how we're improving the outcomes for specifically getting to that third grade mark,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=188)|
| 0:03:15| and then also our middle grades math into Algebra I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=195)|
| 0:03:18| So we know that that mark of third grade reading, as well as that Algebra I, are really precursors to success for students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=198)|
| 0:03:24| so that's the focus when we think about foundational skills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=204)|
| 0:03:27| So you'll see there both data for reading and data for math represented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=207)|
| 0:03:33| With our third grade reading, you see that Aimsweb data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=213)|
| 0:03:37| So Aimsweb is our skills screener, our universal screener that's required by state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=217)|
| 0:03:43| We do give that screener three times a year, so the data you see represented here is our fall data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=223)|
| 0:03:50| In the next report, you'll have the winter data, which was given as this report was being printed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=230)|
| 0:03:56| and then we also have spring data for Aimsweb, which will come out in the final annual report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=236)|
| 0:04:04| We also have there our master review predictive assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=244)|
| 0:04:08| So you can see in that our third grade ELA, our 3.5 ELA, as well as our 6.8 math and our Algebra I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=248)|
| 0:04:15| That assessment we have given twice this year, so once in the fall, and then once again in the spring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=255)|
| 0:04:21| We actually just got data back from that, so again that will be in the next report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=261)|
| 0:04:26| But as you can see there, we're trending about the same that we have in previous years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=266)|
| 0:04:31| when it comes to overall assessment and proficiency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=271)|
| 0:04:35| So what that MVP assessment does is it's a predictor assessment, so it's based around standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=275)|
| 0:04:41| which is different than the universal screener, which is based around discrete skills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=281)|
| 0:04:46| and it really gives us a window into what we might anticipate in terms of TCAP proficiency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=286)|
| 0:04:52| And then you can see at the bottom also our TCAP proficiency from the previous years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=292)|
| 0:04:58| You'll notice on these graphs that the years are in school year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=298)|
| 0:05:02| so you have school year 21, school year 22, school year 23.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=302)|
| 0:05:06| There are some data sets in here that you will notice you do not have school year 23 data for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=306)|
| 0:05:12| That would be because that data is produced annually and we just don't have it yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=312)|
| 0:05:16| but thought it would be important in this report to highlight some of the data from previous years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=316)|
| 0:05:21| which you'll notice I think on the next page or the next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=321)|
| 0:05:26| So the next section is great educators in every school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=326)|
| 0:05:30| This one is about ensuring we have both high-quality teachers and leaders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=330)|
| 0:05:35| You'll notice we have our teacher demographic data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=335)|
| 0:05:38| There has been a request from the Board of Ed to include population data as a comparison for this data point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=338)|
| 0:05:46| so you'll see that in the next report, as well as some of our teacher pipeline data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=346)|
| 0:05:51| So some of the things that we're doing to try and increase recruitment and retention with teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=351)|
| 0:05:57| include our Grow Your Own initiative and the job-embedded practitioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=357)|
| 0:06:02| So you'll see the numbers represented there in terms of how those programs have been growing over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=362)|
| 0:06:12| The next set of data you'll see is our career empowerment and preparation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=372)|
| 0:06:17| So this one is really connected to that transformation and redesign of our high schools around the 865 academies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=377)|
| 0:06:24| and thinking about how we connect the student experience to what's expected both in career| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=384)|
| 0:06:31| and in our own community when it comes to student success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=391)|
| 0:06:35| The data that we're tracking there, again, is the data that was laid out in the annual plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=395)|
| 0:06:39| So you'll see the EPSO data there. You'll see industry credentials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=399)|
| 0:06:44| On the industry credentials and certifications in particular, you'll notice you don't have this year's data yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=404)|
| 0:06:49| Again, that data is reported annually, so it will be in either the next one or the final one that we present in October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=409)|
| 0:07:00| And then the last set of data you have is around success for every student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=420)|
| 0:07:04| So included in that is our chronic absenteeism goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=424)|
| 0:07:07| So you'll see data represented there in terms of how we're trending for chronic absenteeism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=427)|
| 0:07:13| It's important to note in that SY23 data that that is the data at the point in time that it was pulled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=433)|
| 0:07:21| So when you think about chronic absenteeism, you're looking at the total number of days that have been available for a student to attend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=441)|
| 0:07:28| and how are they tracking in terms of absenteeism related to those numbers of days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=448)|
| 0:07:34| So that number could shift slightly 5% up, 5% down generally in terms of trend toward the final.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=454)|
| 0:07:43| With that, any questions? We have the full team here if you have questions about that data or questions about the work in particular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=463)|
| 0:08:02| Thank you all so much. You all do an incredible job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=482)|
| 0:08:05| Having two students going through the public school system, I'm always so grateful for the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=485)|
| 0:08:11| That all of our teachers and administrators do in our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=491)|
| 0:08:15| I'm actually going to miss my kids being in public schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=495)|
| 0:08:19| I have a senior graduating and then we're empty nesters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=499)|
| 0:08:23| Just regarding this report, just a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=503)|
| 0:08:27| You hit on one. I was going to ask if we could also include the student demographic data as a comparison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=507)|
| 0:08:36| Also, would it be possible, I don't know how difficult it would be, to include financial investment per student per school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=516)|
| 0:08:43| If that's something we could possibly include, that might be kind of difficult, or per district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=523)|
| 0:08:50| Something to think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=530)|
| 0:08:52| Yes, I don't know, and I might let Jennifer speak to it if she wants to come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=532)|
| 0:08:58| I don't know that we could do that real clear at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=538)|
| 0:09:01| Where we are right now in terms of transition with the TESA funding model,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=541)|
| 0:09:05| is having been under the BEP, that was a resource allocation model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=545)|
| 0:09:09| Our budgeting framework has also been a resource allocation model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=549)|
| 0:09:14| It's easier to report out in terms of what resources are we funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=554)|
| 0:09:19| and then where are those resources going, versus a per pupil expenditure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=559)|
| 0:09:24| It's certainly something that we can look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=564)|
| 0:09:27| As we think about how we transition that budgeting framework as we move into TESA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=567)|
| 0:09:33| there are opportunities to think about the difference between where we want to stay a resource allocation model,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=573)|
| 0:09:39| and where we want to move to a student-based budgeting model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=579)|
| 0:09:43| Perfect. Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=583)|
| 0:09:44| Also, I know there's been several conversations about post-secondary education and training readiness of our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=584)|
| 0:09:51| Is that something we could also include, just to kind of keep us updated on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=591)|
| 0:09:56| Because I know we've kind of hit some goals collectively with different agencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=596)|
| 0:10:02| but maybe that's something we could also include and monitor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=602)|
| 0:10:06| Yes, we're actually working with Hanover Research right now to solidify our logic model for the 865 academies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=606)|
| 0:10:13| and what leading indicator data we can track towards particularly post-secondary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=613)|
| 0:10:18| Shannon's also doing some work with the Tennessee Achieves group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=618)|
| 0:10:22| to think about data sharing agreements with post-secondary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=622)|
| 0:10:25| and how we might look at both perseverance as well as enrollment rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=625)|
| 0:10:30| So as we get those systems established, that's certainly data that could be included in future reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=630)|
| 0:10:35| Sure. And you mentioned, too, that we're trending similarly to previous years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=635)|
| 0:10:42| One of my questions, just as a parent having a freshman college student coming out of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=642)|
| 0:10:48| especially during the times of COVID, he was a high flyer, an honors student,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=648)|
| 0:10:53| but he really found he was struggling in math on the college level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=653)|
| 0:10:58| And so I guess my question is, logically, I was trying to identify, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=658)|
| 0:11:05| where were those foundational skills deficient in his experience in the public school system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=665)|
| 0:11:12| And of course, you know, I went to, well, COVID, you know, he was online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=672)|
| 0:11:17| There wasn't that direct interaction with teachers and instruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=677)|
| 0:11:22| But if we're trending as in previous years, is that something that we maybe should look a little bit closer to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=682)|
| 0:11:31| Because, I mean, I'll have to be really honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=691)|
| 0:11:34| I was very alarmed at the proficiency rate on the Algebra 1 graph, because that's exactly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=694)|
| 0:11:43| I mean, I have a personal experience with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=703)|
| 0:11:45| I have a student who took Algebra 1 in high school online during COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=705)|
| 0:11:51| And, you know, he was really questioning his abilities in college and just trying to kind of work backwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=711)|
| 0:11:59| How can we enhance that experience for other students and help them, you know, not question their capabilities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=719)|
| 0:12:07| Yep. Algebra 1 is actually an interesting one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=727)|
| 0:12:10| That data tracks pretty similarly to the rest of the state in terms of the achievement for students in Algebra 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=730)|
| 0:12:18| I think there are high hopes for new Algebra 1 curriculum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=738)|
| 0:12:22| And so we are in a math adoption year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=742)|
| 0:12:24| And so looking at getting new instructional materials and certainly as a state and as a nation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=744)|
| 0:12:30| the move towards thinking about the role of instructional materials in terms of the student experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=750)|
| 0:12:36| and helping them meet standards has definitely been elevated in the past several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=756)|
| 0:12:41| So we are, we have adopted and we are purchasing new materials for Algebra 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=761)|
| 0:12:47| So I think that there is a good amount of hope we can have that those materials will help with some of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=767)|
| 0:12:54| There's also just a very high level of rigor for that Algebra 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=774)|
| 0:12:58| And so that assessment in particular seems to be more difficult than other EOC assessments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=778)|
| 0:13:04| in addition to just the content being pretty meaty in terms of what students have to accomplish in the course of a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=784)|
| 0:13:12| So there are certainly also the other things that we're doing like tutoring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=792)|
| 0:13:16| that can potentially play into making students more successful in that Algebra 1 space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=796)|
| 0:13:23| But it's definitely something to keep an eye on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=803)|
| 0:13:26| It's definitely something where we're trying to figure out what are the root causes for why students aren't meeting proficiency in Algebra 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=806)|
| 0:13:33| And that's certainly not a Knox County only problem, but a statewide issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=813)|
| 0:13:38| And if it's helpful to talk to some of those college freshmen and their experience, I'm happy to help coordinate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=818)|
| 0:13:45| I just, I love hearing from students and their experience and how the data kind of, you know, aligns with their actual experiences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=825)|
| 0:13:55| So thank you so much for answering my questions. I greatly appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=835)|
| 0:13:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=839)|
| 0:14:01| Reverend Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=841)|
| 0:14:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=842)|
| 0:14:03| Butler, it's laid back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=843)|
| 0:14:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=845)|
| 0:14:06| I just want to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=846)|
| 0:14:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=849)|
| 0:14:10| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=850)|
| 0:14:12| I echo appreciation for the work that is done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=852)|
| 0:14:17| Two questions or two areas of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=857)|
| 0:14:20| One is this is from the district perspective, but we do have some low performing schools on the state list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=860)|
| 0:14:30| Is it data specific for them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=870)|
| 0:14:32| And it may not be ready to come out yet, but we have some data specific things for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=872)|
| 0:14:38| We do have the capability to look at this data down to the school level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=878)|
| 0:14:43| So certainly, if that's a request of the board, we can put together some reports around how the individual schools compare to the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=883)|
| 0:14:54| And in particular, which schools you might want highlighted in this report in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=894)|
| 0:14:58| I just think it's important when you have a deficiency identified by the state that we put attention on that to make sure that we're doing the things we need to do to correct it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=898)|
| 0:15:11| If you keep on doing what you've been doing, you'll keep on getting what you've been getting type of concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=911)|
| 0:15:16| So, yes, I'd like to see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=916)|
| 0:15:20| And then on the last page, we did see what I call gap information at the bottom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=920)|
| 0:15:31| And the thought process that when we look at this across the board, it's affecting all of our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=931)|
| 0:15:39| But there's a group of students that maybe the data is reporting that they're doing less or not doing as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=939)|
| 0:15:49| So the question is, what are we doing to address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=949)|
| 0:15:54| And one of the things I think about is that a number of students who are in the black, Hispanic, Native American, economic disadvantaged group, particularly, start off school behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=954)|
| 0:16:09| Start off kindergarten not at grade level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=969)|
| 0:16:13| So I think that as a system, we may need to look at how do we prepare them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=973)|
| 0:16:19| Although right now we're K through 12, we do have some pre-K opportunities, but we may need to think that, and this may be a broader discussion than just for this committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=979)|
| 0:16:33| but we may think about, and just let me give a little history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=993)|
| 0:16:38| When I went to school, we didn't have pre-K.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=998)|
| 0:16:41| We had K. We didn't have K. We had first grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1001)|
| 0:16:44| And so someone said, well, first grade is not enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1004)|
| 0:16:47| We need to start with kindergarten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1007)|
| 0:16:49| Now we're at a point where we understand kindergarten is not enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1009)|
| 0:16:52| We may need to invest dollars into pre-K.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1012)|
| 0:16:58| Because if we continue to have kids coming into K behind, then logic is that unless we do something extremely aggressive, they're going to come to third grade and still be behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1018)|
| 0:17:14| So that's the concern I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1034)|
| 0:17:16| Are we doing things to change the root cause versus just treating symptoms?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1036)|
| 0:17:23| I'll share a little bit, and then I'll see if Jason wants to come in and add to that in terms of what his team is doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1043)|
| 0:17:29| I think the first layer of approach to that is really making sure that we're providing high quality grade level content across all grades in terms of a high quality tier one experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1049)|
| 0:17:43| And so the team's been working really hard this year to help with the continued rollout and implementation of high quality instructional materials and literacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1063)|
| 0:17:52| I'm really making sure that all of our early literacy teachers are attending that state training around the science of reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1072)|
| 0:17:58| And really starting to help think about how we support our principals and leaders in knowing what to look for to ensure that we're setting really the floor for what all students should be experiencing in their tier one classroom experiences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1078)|
| 0:18:13| That will continue on as we roll into this math adoption of really thinking about how do we ensure that that floor level is consistent, is equitable, is meeting our standard for excellence across the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1093)|
| 0:18:26| And so a lot of work has been going into how do we standardize that, how do we ensure quality, and how do we support our teachers, our staff, and our leaders to make sure that that quality exists across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1106)|
| 0:18:37| So that's the first layer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1117)|
| 0:18:39| The second then is making sure that we have the right interventions in place and the supports for students who need more than just that tier one experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1119)|
| 0:18:47| So really been focusing also on thinking about our RTI, what interventions we offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1127)|
| 0:18:53| I know Jason's team has been working on procuring additional interventions so that we can have the right interventions to meet student needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1133)|
| 0:19:01| And then making sure that all students are getting access to quality interventions based on the needs that they have for them as individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1141)|
| 0:19:10| And then the next layer of that is also the tutoring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1150)|
| 0:19:13| So tutoring is an extension of that intervention experience in that it provides additional opportunities for students to get access points back to that tier one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1153)|
| 0:19:24| So when we think about a gap, it's important that students get opportunities at grade level, but we also need opportunities to support them in reaching that bar, and that's the role that tutoring can play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1164)|
| 0:19:35| So really helping to kind of pull those pieces together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1175)|
| 0:19:38| And so as the team focuses on those three parts of the priority work, those are things that we should see, influence, and fill gaps, and help us see more equitable outcomes over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1178)|
| 0:19:51| But Jason, would you like to add to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1191)|
| 0:19:58| Dr. Norton did a really great job. Good morning. I'm Jason Myers, Assistant Superintendent of Student Success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1198)|
| 0:20:05| So back to Dr. Butler's question about some of the schools that have traditionally been low performing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1205)|
| 0:20:11| I know since the beginning of this school year we've talked a lot about the region structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1211)|
| 0:20:15| and there have been a lot of questions that we've addressed about Region 5 and its placement in the Division of Student Success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1215)|
| 0:20:22| And we've been talking about we're working on a strategic plan so that we can bring some new ideas, new initiatives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1222)|
| 0:20:28| and a new way of promoting excellence in our Region 5 schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1228)|
| 0:20:33| And so I wanted to touch on that briefly since we had everyone here together, and Dr. Butler asked a question that was relevant to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1233)|
| 0:20:39| So we've been working through this process, honestly, really since the beginning of the year, but really digging in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1239)|
| 0:20:45| starting in November of last semester, working with a team to really dig in and get a lot of feedback from community partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1245)|
| 0:20:55| They've done a great job of doing everything from individual interviews to focus group interviews,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1255)|
| 0:21:01| to really dig in and start to collaborate with our community partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1261)|
| 0:21:06| They've worked with principals, they've worked with our teaching force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1266)|
| 0:21:09| and they've even met with kids to talk about our Region 5 schools, what we see there that's going well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1269)|
| 0:21:16| and where we see areas of opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1276)|
| 0:21:19| And what we've done is worked to develop a strategic plan, a five-year strategic plan, to start addressing some of those needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1279)|
| 0:21:26| We'll be rolling that plan out in the coming weeks, and I can tell you it's exciting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1286)|
| 0:21:31| We really are putting a lot of work, and I think we're going to be putting a lot of resources toward improving our schools there in Region 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1291)|
| 0:21:42| So I think when you see the budget proposal, you're going to see a lot of things where we're really, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1302)|
| 0:21:48| it's one thing to say you're committed, it's another thing to show you that we're committed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1308)|
| 0:21:51| And so I think as we start looking at budget proposals for the coming school year, you mentioned pre-K access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1311)|
| 0:21:58| I know Dr. Reiswick is very committed to making sure that we're getting kids those early opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1318)|
| 0:22:04| because really our best way to get kids ready is to get them ready early, early, early, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1324)|
| 0:22:09| And so I think you'll see that in our budget proposals, which will be forthcoming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1329)|
| 0:22:15| So just, again, just a brief update on where we're at with Region 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1335)|
| 0:22:19| The plan will be coming out in the coming weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1339)|
| 0:22:21| and I think it's going to be a really great opportunity for kids and a great opportunity for our staff to engage in some really important work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1341)|
| 0:22:29| When that plan comes out, is that a meeting, or will it be presented at your school board meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1349)|
| 0:22:35| or is it a special community meeting that will happen to discuss those results?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1355)|
| 0:22:40| Sir, I think that's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1360)|
| 0:22:42| And so really what our plan is, because we've been so purposeful in how we've gathered this information, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1362)|
| 0:22:48| So one of the first steps we're going to take is we want to make sure we close that communication loop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1368)|
| 0:22:52| with the groups that have been involved in helping us draft this plan, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1372)|
| 0:22:57| So at this point, we're still working with our team to determine how exactly we want to go about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1377)|
| 0:23:03| I don't know that we envision there being just a big, like, ribbon-cutting kind of ceremony where we roll this plan out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1383)|
| 0:23:09| because to be quite honest, from my perspective, this is the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1389)|
| 0:23:14| This is what school is, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1394)|
| 0:23:16| Like, we're executing a five-year strategic plan, you know, to try to do what's best for kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1396)|
| 0:23:22| To me, the big event is after year one, and we've shown some growth, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1402)|
| 0:23:28| Like, a plan is just a plan until we actually make something happen, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1408)|
| 0:23:32| And I think that that's where my commitment is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1412)|
| 0:23:35| I know we've, as part of this process, working toward establishing very strong and ambitious metrics around success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1415)|
| 0:23:41| How are we going to know we did a good job?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1421)|
| 0:23:43| So to me, the thing that's worthy of celebration is not that we made a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1423)|
| 0:23:47| School leaders should have, we should have a plan, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1427)|
| 0:23:50| To me, what's worthy of pomp and circumstance and excitement is when the plan has actually worked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1430)|
| 0:23:57| and we've done something to benefit our kids and our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1437)|
| 0:24:01| Well, thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1441)|
| 0:24:04| I feel like we're going through a disruption of education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1444)|
| 0:24:08| Especially, I spoke at an elementary school in my district, and the burden is heavy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1448)|
| 0:24:16| and you can see it and you can sense it on the teachers and the support staff of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1456)|
| 0:24:22| when I spoke to a group of kids, I didn't realize some of them were homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1462)|
| 0:24:29| Some of them may have gave me hints of being in gangs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1469)|
| 0:24:37| And I'm trying to figure out how do we really do the education and empowerment of those students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1477)|
| 0:24:44| It seems like, you know, are we here to purely educate, or is it like a social work system, too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1484)|
| 0:24:51| I mean, the expansion of how do we raise a family together so the student will be educated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1491)|
| 0:24:57| And I hope what I say is making sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1497)|
| 0:24:59| But I'm just trying to figure this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1499)|
| 0:25:03| Because, I mean, I know the teachers care and the support staff care, and it's becoming heavy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1503)|
| 0:25:09| and I'm also concerned about the mental health of our teachers having to serve those communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1509)|
| 0:25:19| I'm doing too much. I'm sorry, Doctor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1519)|
| 0:25:23| So thanks for that, for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1523)|
| 0:25:27| And thanks for Jason. I mean, it cut him off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1527)|
| 0:25:29| You did a great job talking through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1529)|
| 0:25:31| I think, like, we hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1531)|
| 0:25:33| So we've said this from the beginning about eight months ago that some of the things you're talking about are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1533)|
| 0:25:39| we are part of the community, but we can't be the full community in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1539)|
| 0:25:43| You know, we don't have, you know, that level of counseling and all those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1543)|
| 0:25:49| So we made that call a couple months ago to the full community and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1549)|
| 0:25:52| hey, if we're going to raise this next generation up to be successful in Knox County, it's going to take all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1552)|
| 0:25:57| And so I think that's been the beautiful thing about this Region 5 plan that Jason was talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1557)|
| 0:26:04| It really has been purposeful in interviewing people and talking to people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1564)|
| 0:26:08| And part of that rollout to that, so I'm going to answer your question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1568)|
| 0:26:11| but part of the reason we've gotten to that is we don't want it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1571)|
| 0:26:14| This is not a, okay, great, we heard you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1574)|
| 0:26:16| Like, in the past, my two cents, long generation of us engaging the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1576)|
| 0:26:22| we've done it in a way that has been kind of like, okay, there's a fever pitch in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1582)|
| 0:26:27| Let's have a meeting, let the air out of the balloon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1587)|
| 0:26:29| and then let's go back to our corners and keep doing what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1589)|
| 0:26:32| That's not how we've approached any of these things over the last eight months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1592)|
| 0:26:35| Even our community engagement strategies where we've had regional teacher teams,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1595)|
| 0:26:38| where we've had regional family teams, you know, they've been working groups this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1598)|
| 0:26:44| And in June, they're going to come present to the board what each of those regions, what their work was this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1604)|
| 0:26:49| You know, so we've done the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1609)|
| 0:26:51| I have a CASEL group that is a student accelerated learning group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1611)|
| 0:26:55| and that's been about 40 just really dedicated community people from all across the district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1615)|
| 0:27:01| who have broken into four working groups, and they're working on plans that they want to continue into the fall to bring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1621)|
| 0:27:05| And so we've engaged differently, and to Jason's point, we want to avoid just like an event, a ribbon cutting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1625)|
| 0:27:13| Okay, guys, here's the answer, you know, and everybody goes, all right, we took care of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1633)|
| 0:27:17| and now we have something on paper, but we don't move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1637)|
| 0:27:19| So we're trying to, we keep saying everything is a three to five year process for us that is well thought out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1639)|
| 0:27:26| and then fluid as we continue to work with folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1646)|
| 0:27:29| So on that region five, I'll add this to what Jason said, on that region five rollout,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1649)|
| 0:27:33| we've embraced the community and we've asked the community to be part of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1653)|
| 0:27:37| We don't want to stand up and talk back to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1657)|
| 0:27:40| Our goal is to have those core stakeholders, and we've identified 40 to 50 to have those kinds of conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1660)|
| 0:27:46| Back in with them when we've got this thing finished and go, this is what we all agreed on, right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1666)|
| 0:27:50| and then stand hand in hand with them together in the conversation with the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1670)|
| 0:27:55| not all those folks line up on the front row and go, you know, we're going to judge whether we like it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1675)|
| 0:27:59| Like that's not a community answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1679)|
| 0:28:02| So we want to come back to these guys and ladies and women and leaders and kind of say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1682)|
| 0:28:08| this is what we're committed to for the next three to five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1688)|
| 0:28:10| There's going to be times it's going to be hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1690)|
| 0:28:12| There's going to be times it's going to be rough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1692)|
| 0:28:14| I had a conversation with Paul Hancock yesterday when we met in our regular meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1694)|
| 0:28:18| and I said, you do understand to your point about changing landscape education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1698)|
| 0:28:22| That's not what you're referring to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1702)|
| 0:28:23| There are other things changing on the landscape of education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1703)|
| 0:28:26| For us to be ready to compete, we're not afraid to compete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1706)|
| 0:28:29| For us to be ready to compete, there's going to be some cheese moved in some schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1709)|
| 0:28:33| to get those programs up to what we need to get done rapidly so we can compete with charters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1713)|
| 0:28:39| Now it sounds like vouchers and ESAs and all those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1719)|
| 0:28:42| We're not afraid of the competition, but we can't, to your point, Reverend Butler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1722)|
| 0:28:45| we can't continue to do what we've been doing or we'll get the same results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1725)|
| 0:28:49| So I told her, be ready, because there will be some people who call you and go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1729)|
| 0:28:52| this is moving fast, and it's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1732)|
| 0:28:54| It is going to be, because we have to for the kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1734)|
| 0:28:58| We're not doing it because we just want to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1738)|
| 0:29:00| But we need to make sure, and that's why we've tried to take time in the last couple months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1740)|
| 0:29:03| to reach to that next layer of community people so that they're informed, they're on board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1743)|
| 0:29:08| and when times do get tough again, we join hands and go, we're doing this for kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1748)|
| 0:29:11| and we think these are the right things to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1751)|
| 0:29:14| We won't get it all right either, and we know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1754)|
| 0:29:16| That's why, to Mr. Meyer's point, we don't want to do this kind of ribbon-cutting, boom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1756)|
| 0:29:21| 400 people in the meeting, and could you sign off, could you sign off, and what am I signing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1761)|
| 0:29:25| Okay, I'll do that if you sign this for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1765)|
| 0:29:27| That's how it happens sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1767)|
| 0:29:28| That's not what we want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1768)|
| 0:29:30| We want to get back into the communities where we probably will do multiple,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1770)|
| 0:29:33| we're still working through this, we'll probably do multiple meetings in communities that are in Region 5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1773)|
| 0:29:37| so that transportation is not a barrier to come to the meetings and hear the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1777)|
| 0:29:40| and do those sorts of things, and then really share, guys, this is where we are right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1780)|
| 0:29:44| this is what we believe the ultimate goal for Year 5 is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1784)|
| 0:29:47| this is why this matters, and talking through those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1787)|
| 0:29:49| That, to me, is real engagement of the community and real commitment moving forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1789)|
| 0:29:53| and I think that's the same way, back to your original question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1793)|
| 0:29:56| that we address some of these social issues that are coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1796)|
| 0:29:59| We want to be at the table as part of the community with the churches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1799)|
| 0:30:03| and with the government and with the businesses, but we aren't the full answer for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1803)|
| 0:30:07| So there will be times we ask, and I think our issue in the past has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1807)|
| 0:30:12| we've figured out our own solutions on our own, we've kind of been shut off to things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1812)|
| 0:30:16| and I think we're seeing that with things like our 865, overwhelming support from the business community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1816)|
| 0:30:21| of people wanting to be part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1821)|
| 0:30:23| That was because we approached differently what we were doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1823)|
| 0:30:26| We came to the community and said, here's what's best for kids for the next generation of the workforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1826)|
| 0:30:31| We embraced the chamber, we embraced both mayors, we embraced this whole conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1831)|
| 0:30:34| and people are going, oh, you really want us in the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1834)|
| 0:30:37| It's not just something you're going to do and you're telling us about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1837)|
| 0:30:40| And so that's our whole plan with Region 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1840)|
| 0:30:42| You're going to see things coming up with the special education deep dive we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1842)|
| 0:30:46| All of these things have multiple steps that we'll be rolling out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1846)|
| 0:30:49| and we'll continue to talk to the public about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1849)|
| 0:30:51| It's just, again, our administration has been in for eight months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1851)|
| 0:30:54| and building all those things to get those systems right so we make sure when we talk about them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1854)|
| 0:30:58| we're not just tickling people's ears, but we're actually delivering on what we said we're going to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1858)|
| 0:31:02| and there's an actual plan to get that done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1862)|
| 0:31:04| So I would say, yes, you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1864)|
| 0:31:07| We want to be at the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1867)|
| 0:31:09| I know Mayor Kincaid has been an example of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1869)|
| 0:31:11| We had a conversation when we were talking about reducing violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1871)|
| 0:31:14| She asked us to be at the table, and my conversation with her was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1874)|
| 0:31:18| we'll be at the table as a community member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1878)|
| 0:31:20| And she said, this is not a school issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1880)|
| 0:31:22| And I said, yeah, but at the same time, we're part of that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1882)|
| 0:31:25| So we want to be at the table with, again, the faith leaders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1885)|
| 0:31:29| and all those other business leaders and everyone else as part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1889)|
| 0:31:32| But it's not a, you know, it's your problem, it's our problem, it's that problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1892)|
| 0:31:35| So I know I've talked a lot, but that's kind of how we're trying to develop everything that we do and present those out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1895)|
| 0:31:40| Well, yeah, I definitely appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1900)|
| 0:31:42| And I know, Reverend Bullard, you know, we represent the same district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1902)|
| 0:31:46| and I love the conversation that, you know, we are no longer working in silos anymore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1906)|
| 0:31:52| and we are all here called to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1912)|
| 0:31:55| So I appreciate you for, I don't know who's decision, but I know it's a team effort of focusing on Region 5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1915)|
| 0:32:01| because we know the struggle, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1921)|
| 0:32:04| And we live it and we see it, and it gets hard on me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1924)|
| 0:32:08| So, and I know it's a heavy lift on everybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1928)|
| 0:32:11| So I just want to say I appreciate where we're going, and I know that what we're heading to is really a war.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1931)|
| 0:32:18| We are trying to take back, take away the negativity and bring back our positivity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1938)|
| 0:32:25| and give light to District 1, and I know it's our time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1945)|
| 0:32:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1949)|
| 0:32:31| Let me say that I agree, because I've been part of this process, I believe, not from the beginning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1951)|
| 0:32:41| but because it began before I came on board, but I feel like we're just starting, almost starting together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1961)|
| 0:32:47| And so I like, and I've worked with Region 5 assistant principal and director and principals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1967)|
| 0:32:57| and also came to KICMA, which is Ministerial Alliance of Majority Black Ministers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1977)|
| 0:33:07| who represent black congregations in the black community, and we've had a chance to have input and continue to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1987)|
| 0:33:16| But I do also think there needs to be, as you say, community meetings, but meetings in the communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=1996)|
| 0:33:25| because there's a lot of people who are involved with this that are not on the focus groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2005)|
| 0:33:32| And as much as we like for it to think it happens this way, the trickle-down effect don't always work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2012)|
| 0:33:39| with funds or with information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2019)|
| 0:33:43| So I think we have to get out there and share the plan and invite everyone to be involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2023)|
| 0:33:52| whether they are part of a focus organization or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2032)|
| 0:33:57| So I think that's going to be a major piece, and certainly not a celebration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2037)|
| 0:34:02| In fact, I can assure you that there are going to be some folk who ain't in the celebrating mood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2042)|
| 0:34:09| But I do think it's a time that we say this is what we want to do, and we want you to be involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2049)|
| 0:34:15| and give persons a chance to first become aware of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2055)|
| 0:34:20| There's still some folk who are not aware of it, and then once they become aware of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2060)|
| 0:34:25| understand this is what we're trying to do, and then spend some time with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2065)|
| 0:34:29| and then coming back periodically and say this is where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2069)|
| 0:34:35| So I think that that's a piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2075)|
| 0:34:37| But going back to one of the questions I raised was the early childhood component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2077)|
| 0:34:44| I really believe if we don't start earlier, and I'm not going to get muddled down in the third-grade retention law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2084)|
| 0:34:53| but if we don't get started earlier, between this is what I'm understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2093)|
| 0:34:59| and there's folk who know more about it than I do here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2099)|
| 0:35:02| But there are certain things if you get between one age from birth to five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2102)|
| 0:35:08| that's when you're just soaking in information, soaking in information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2108)|
| 0:35:13| And I knew that, but then when I watched my youngest grandchild who was turning three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2113)|
| 0:35:21| and I said to all of my children, because I watched them do it, whatever you say, they're going to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2121)|
| 0:35:28| And so it's so true that that's an age where they're just accumulating, and we're starting at five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2128)|
| 0:35:37| And I'm saying that we as a society, as a district, as a system needs to reach earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2137)|
| 0:35:43| and be very intentional about starting earlier, because what's happening is, and this is how I see it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2143)|
| 0:35:52| 865 is awesome. I'm excited about it. I really am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2152)|
| 0:35:58| But there are some kids who could benefit from 865 that's not going to make it there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2158)|
| 0:36:03| simply because we missed them between one and five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2163)|
| 0:36:07| So I think that's a piece that I just can't let go, and I know this is built in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2167)|
| 0:36:13| We talked about it, and we looked at some plans, but I think we really have to be careful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2173)|
| 0:36:18| that we don't try to fix it on the back end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2178)|
| 0:36:21| We've got to fix it on the front end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2181)|
| 0:36:24| Yeah, I agree, and I'll let you speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2184)|
| 0:36:27| Also, Dr. Risewick, and I think that that's one of those pieces, too, where community comes together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2187)|
| 0:36:32| because we are a K through 12, and when I kind of started diving into this whole literacy thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2192)|
| 0:36:38| which is a big passion of mine, literacy really, if they're behind in kindergarten, they're going to be behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2198)|
| 0:36:47| So really that birth through five is a vital piece, the vital piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2207)|
| 0:36:52| But that's where community can also come together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2212)|
| 0:36:54| I know United Way has launched their Bright Steps campaign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2214)|
| 0:36:58| So that's another way, and I'm really excited about our school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2218)|
| 0:37:01| because I think we're really at a tipping point of where community is really coming together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2221)|
| 0:37:07| and not just talking about it, not just saying, you know, yeah, that sounds fantastic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2227)|
| 0:37:12| and we all want those things, but I think we're actually seeing that intentional plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2232)|
| 0:37:18| and those steps and those action items and really coming together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2238)|
| 0:37:21| And I know that, and I'll let you speak to that a little bit more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2241)|
| 0:37:24| but that is another piece where community is coming together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2244)|
| 0:37:27| and how do we not work in silos and come together around our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2247)|
| 0:37:32| I appreciate that, and I'll say Dr. Lackey, our pre-K supervisor, was the co-chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2252)|
| 0:37:37| She's amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2257)|
| 0:37:38| She was the co-chair of that with Ellie from United Way on Bright Steps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2258)|
| 0:37:42| and so that's work we have been involved in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2262)|
| 0:37:45| Let me shed a little light into that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2265)|
| 0:37:47| We agree 100%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2267)|
| 0:37:50| This is why it takes time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2270)|
| 0:37:51| We're tackling areas that the district, you know, it just, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2271)|
| 0:37:55| a lot of stuff happens over 30 years, right, that we haven't tackled in a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2275)|
| 0:37:59| You know, nonprofit supports after school and before school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2279)|
| 0:38:02| It's messy, and they're great folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2282)|
| 0:38:04| Every one of those organizations are great folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2284)|
| 0:38:06| There's grants and there's this and there's that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2286)|
| 0:38:08| and it's restricted by this and that, when they can have kids and we can't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2288)|
| 0:38:11| how they use our facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2291)|
| 0:38:12| I mean, we've been having all those conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2292)|
| 0:38:14| A really good conversation with Bart McFadden and Jim Dixon at YMCA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2294)|
| 0:38:17| and, you know, some of those things we'll be able to solve, some we won't initially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2297)|
| 0:38:21| but we're having real conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2301)|
| 0:38:23| I think this pre-K space is another one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2303)|
| 0:38:25| You know, we don't have any legal jurisdiction over there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2305)|
| 0:38:28| so it totally has to be a will thing that everyone wants to come together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2308)|
| 0:38:32| So we applaud Matt and Ellie and what they're doing at United Way to kind of say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2312)|
| 0:38:35| can we get in that space and kind of map what's there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2315)|
| 0:38:37| and then let's see what we can do with a whole lot of support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2317)|
| 0:38:40| You know, we're on board with that, and, you know, I think to what Mr. Meyer said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2320)|
| 0:38:44| I don't want to totally get out there yet because we haven't talked to all the board members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2324)|
| 0:38:47| and that sort of thing, but I think you'll see a commitment in this budget cycle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2327)|
| 0:38:50| to some pre-K things that we want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2330)|
| 0:38:52| And, again, everything is a three- to five-year project, so it's not going to be, boom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2332)|
| 0:38:56| we figured out pre-K this year, and budgets will never handle that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2336)|
| 0:38:59| But just that commitment to try to structurally build supports for those kinds of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2339)|
| 0:39:03| to happen and how we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2343)|
| 0:39:04| What we're finding lots of times is we haven't even had point people in the district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2344)|
| 0:39:08| to run the nonprofit conversations or the pre-K conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2348)|
| 0:39:12| So, you know, we're not behind in the game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2352)|
| 0:39:14| I mean, we are as a community, but they're in the same place at United Way right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2354)|
| 0:39:18| We're trying to figure out who those right people are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2358)|
| 0:39:20| So there will be things we'll fail forward on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2360)|
| 0:39:22| There will be things that we'll think are great ideas that end up not being great ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2362)|
| 0:39:26| But I think the thing we all share is that commitment to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2366)|
| 0:39:28| how do we start getting good models in that space?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2368)|
| 0:39:31| You've got federally funded programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2371)|
| 0:39:33| You've got locally funded programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2373)|
| 0:39:34| You've got grant funded programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2374)|
| 0:39:36| And all that together has to be patchworked together to make a better network| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2376)|
| 0:39:40| before kids come to kindergarten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2380)|
| 0:39:42| And we have to also be aware of turf and how people have claimed turf in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2382)|
| 0:39:48| and who's better suited for that and can we give that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2388)|
| 0:39:51| So that's a lot of vulnerability for a lot of very successful organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2391)|
| 0:39:55| and a lot of those raised funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2395)|
| 0:39:56| So the fact that we're at the table having those conversations, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2396)|
| 0:40:00| will probably be a multi-year step and some missteps in the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2400)|
| 0:40:02| But it doesn't mean we don't need to have it because it is critical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2402)|
| 0:40:05| So I agree with what you are saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2405)|
| 0:40:07| And I know we're short on time, and I'm the newbie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2407)|
| 0:40:09| So I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2409)|
| 0:40:11| And I'm also one of those that is relentless about asking questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2411)|
| 0:40:14| But quickly, some additional questions and comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2414)|
| 0:40:17| And if we need to have a follow-up conversation, I know I can grab any of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2417)|
| 0:40:21| But I also sit on the Hardin Valley Academy High School Advisory Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2421)|
| 0:40:26| And at the last meeting, it was very apparent to me that our teachers feel like they're in crisis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2426)|
| 0:40:31| as well as the students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2431)|
| 0:40:33| Part of that is the mental health component that we're all kind of mucking through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2433)|
| 0:40:37| and trying to figure out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2437)|
| 0:40:39| But suicide assessments are up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2439)|
| 0:40:41| And staff turnover has not only impacted our students but our teacher teams as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2441)|
| 0:40:49| And I'm just wondering, I saw where we've got about 100 openings system-wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2449)|
| 0:40:55| What have been the numbers through the year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2455)|
| 0:40:58| I mean, I know that, like, for instance, my child has had three teachers in one class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2458)|
| 0:41:04| And that is kind of, you know, it's tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2464)|
| 0:41:07| It's tough on kids and it's tough on our teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2467)|
| 0:41:10| You know, how you're addressing that, that's one point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2470)|
| 0:41:13| And then also at our legislative conference with local legislators across the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2473)|
| 0:41:20| the TISA funding breakout session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2480)|
| 0:41:22| there were questions about sustainability with that model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2482)|
| 0:41:25| And then also it was brought up that they were giving us historical data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2485)|
| 0:41:30| that charter schools traditionally are not successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2490)|
| 0:41:34| And so many of the local legislators were kind of trying to figure that out as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2494)|
| 0:41:40| And I guess I'm just curious as to your thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2500)|
| 0:41:43| And then the last point was, I'm sorry I have so many points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2503)|
| 0:41:48| I also serve on the Community Action Committee and youth homelessness is on the rise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2508)|
| 0:41:54| And it's very sad because we can't, we don't have the data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2514)|
| 0:41:58| because those children and those students are leaving home and they're not reporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2518)|
| 0:42:04| And so they don't go into the database because they don't want to be flagged, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2524)|
| 0:42:11| And so that's another concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2531)|
| 0:42:13| And then also talking about the earlier education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2533)|
| 0:42:18| our Head Start programs through the Community Action Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2538)|
| 0:42:22| right now 13 out of 39 classrooms are closed because of staffing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2542)|
| 0:42:27| And we have a waiting list for those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2547)|
| 0:42:29| So like you said, it's very difficult kind of getting in the weeds with all of these partnering agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2549)|
| 0:42:36| But I have to say I absolutely love the fact that we are as communities coming together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2556)|
| 0:42:42| because for over a century our schools have been the heart and the soul and the spirit of communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2562)|
| 0:42:50| And I really feel like we are shifting back to embracing that concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2570)|
| 0:42:56| and embracing our schools as the heart, as the gathering place of community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2576)|
| 0:43:02| And, you know, I represent the entire county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2582)|
| 0:43:05| And I can tell you that for years businesses, other nonprofits have said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2585)|
| 0:43:09| how can we get involved, how can we get engaged?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2589)|
| 0:43:12| And now I have an answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2592)|
| 0:43:14| You know, I have an answer, and I'm really, really excited about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2594)|
| 0:43:18| And I want to thank you all because this is not easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2598)|
| 0:43:22| The amount of information and concerns that you all have to consider, it's exhausting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2602)|
| 0:43:32| It is exhausting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2612)|
| 0:43:33| And so on those bad days, just remember that we support you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2613)|
| 0:43:38| We all want what is best for our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2618)|
| 0:43:41| That's the game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2621)|
| 0:43:42| I mean, that is the end game, whatever is best for our students to succeed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2622)|
| 0:43:46| And I love that we're having intentional conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2626)|
| 0:43:50| And, you know, I really do feel like you have commissioners who have good relationships with their school board representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2630)|
| 0:43:58| and who talk and are just doing life together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2638)|
| 0:44:02| And that makes all the difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2642)|
| 0:44:04| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2644)|
| 0:44:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2646)|
| 0:44:07| And I'll just say again, I'm blessed with an incredible team that you guys see today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2647)|
| 0:44:12| Also, we are out in the field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2652)|
| 0:44:14| I mean, I've been able to get to about 60.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2654)|
| 0:44:16| I'm going to get to every school before we're done, but about 60 already this year for pretty deep visits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2656)|
| 0:44:20| And a lot of the things you're talking about, I hear those same things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2660)|
| 0:44:23| I do want to say one thing, and then if Ms. Himmelgaard wants to address the one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2663)|
| 0:44:27| I was trying to write them all down in my head, Kim, but I'm not sure I got to them all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2667)|
| 0:44:31| But if she wants to talk about the retentions, not retentions, but openings from past years and how it was this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2671)|
| 0:44:38| I will say this, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2678)|
| 0:44:39| Interesting kind of you're right on the suicidal part and the mental challenges that are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2679)|
| 0:44:46| It's interesting, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2686)|
| 0:44:47| I kind of think there is that definitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2687)|
| 0:44:50| There's also this thing of, you know, we all grew up saying there wasn't anybody with a peanut butter allergy that we knew,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2690)|
| 0:44:54| and now there's a lot of people, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2694)|
| 0:44:56| And I think what happens is medicine got better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2696)|
| 0:44:58| Medicine figured out, you know, where a kid might have had an upset stomach or this or that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2698)|
| 0:45:01| Oh, that was a peanut allergy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2701)|
| 0:45:02| We didn't know it, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2702)|
| 0:45:03| And then you build systems to take care of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2703)|
| 0:45:05| I would say kudos to Jason's team, Janice Cook and her team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2705)|
| 0:45:08| You know, we've built over a short amount of time, I think four years ago, we didn't have a Janice and a school culture team, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2708)|
| 0:45:15| And so we've built out a tremendous team to get a lot of that done and build out response and crisis response and how we do those assessments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2715)|
| 0:45:22| So some of the increase in those are I think we're actually getting to them, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2722)|
| 0:45:27| We actually have a system and a way to do that and identify that we probably weren't four or five years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2727)|
| 0:45:32| And so, you know, there is now it's very obvious how to do that, and the counselors are trained in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2732)|
| 0:45:39| and there's a team from downtown that assesses and looks through all those assessments, and, like, that didn't exist before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2739)|
| 0:45:44| So, you know, some of the uptick is we're probably catching what we weren't catching before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2744)|
| 0:45:48| and then we also know, you know, society is as society is right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2748)|
| 0:45:51| So, you know, we continue to build out on that and work to get better at doing those kinds of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2751)|
| 0:45:55| and I think that make a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2755)|
| 0:45:56| But I'm going to be quiet now and let Ms. Hemwell-Garner, if she wants to speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2756)|
| 0:46:00| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2760)|
| 0:46:05| Yes, our vacancies, specifically where they are, I'll answer the specific question first and then give you a little detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2765)|
| 0:46:12| So where we are with vacancies right now compared to last year is about the same,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2772)|
| 0:46:16| because at this point we've opened all of our vacancies for next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2776)|
| 0:46:20| So if you go on our website, look at a list of vacancies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2780)|
| 0:46:23| not all of those are vacancies in the classroom right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2783)|
| 0:46:26| because we've posted all the known vacancies for next year as a result of retirements or resignations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2786)|
| 0:46:32| So that's the number in the book that's a little under 200 for next year, but there are more than 200 on our site right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2792)|
| 0:46:39| To fill those vacancies, our Talent Acquisition Department is implementing a lot of new strategies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2799)|
| 0:46:46| doing some tried and true, but implementing a lot of new strategies this year as well that we're really excited about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2806)|
| 0:46:52| They are, one, making candidates more accessible to our principals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2812)|
| 0:46:57| So our candidates are getting lists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2817)|
| 0:46:59| Our principals are getting lists of candidates that have applied to the district, not just their specific posting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2819)|
| 0:47:05| So without that extra step, they wouldn't necessarily see all those candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2825)|
| 0:47:10| Our Talent Acquisition Department is doing early interviews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2830)|
| 0:47:13| So candidates that have expressed an interest in Knox County schools before these positions for next year even posted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2833)|
| 0:47:20| doing early screenings, recording those interviews, using the same rubric, making those candidate lists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2840)|
| 0:47:26| and recorded interviews available to our principals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2846)|
| 0:47:29| And our principals had an opportunity to early hire all of those pre-screened candidates for next year as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2849)|
| 0:47:36| So, yes, we recognize that there are new strategies needed because we do still have vacancies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2856)|
| 0:47:44| Of course, the goal is to start the school year with zero vacancies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2864)|
| 0:47:48| because one vacancy doesn't sound like a lot, but we recognize that that's one whole classroom full of students without a teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2868)|
| 0:47:54| So our talent team is very aware of that and is implementing some very new and exciting things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2874)|
| 0:48:08| I know we're kind of running low on time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2888)|
| 0:48:10| I mean, I could talk about this stuff for hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2890)|
| 0:48:13| I love this committee because it really does bring together the two boards and really highlights education and what is going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2893)|
| 0:48:22| because our schools are such a bedrock of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2902)|
| 0:48:28| And I just want to thank Dr. Ryswick and his team for all you guys do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2908)|
| 0:48:32| I think you guys are incredible and are really taking our schools to the next level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2912)|
| 0:48:36| and being intentional with our regions and the priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2916)|
| 0:48:41| So thank you so much for everything y'all do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2921)|
| 0:48:44| I think the only other thing we have on the agenda, does anybody else have any other business they want to discuss?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2924)|
| 0:48:49| Okay, I know our next meeting is, and I think it's our last meeting actually, is going to be May 19th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2929)|
| 0:48:55| And so I am working on some topics for that, which I'm pretty excited about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2935)|
| 0:49:01| And does anybody else have anything else they want to add or questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2941)|
| 0:49:05| I would like to go with what Knox County is doing with AI, the future of AI,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2945)|
| 0:49:11| and the ethics of using chat GPT in the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2951)|
| 0:49:15| And I would love to know how that's integrated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2955)|
| 0:49:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2959)|
| 0:49:22| All righty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2962)|
| 0:49:24| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2964)|
| 0:49:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2966)|
| 0:49:27| Well, with that, we are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2967)|
| 0:49:28| Let me use this little gavel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2968)|
| 0:49:33| Thank you for speaking, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230324-joint-education-committee-meeting?start=2973)|
