| 0:02:01| Okay. Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=121)|
| 0:02:04| Thank you to all of Council for continuing these much needed conversations in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=124)|
| 0:02:09| We've had several workshops with KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=129)|
| 0:02:12| This is our fourth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=132)|
| 0:02:14| And I know there's been a lot of extra time commitment by Council members, but you are all super committed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=134)|
| 0:02:19| And I really appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=139)|
| 0:02:21| And this is a complicated subject matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=141)|
| 0:02:23| So the more we can inform ourselves, the more then we can share that information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=143)|
| 0:02:28| and ideas for solutions and improvements with the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=148)|
| 0:02:33| I'm proud to say that while some other communities are shying away from real analysis of tough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=153)|
| 0:02:38| topics, the city of Knoxville continues to face matters head on in a transparent and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=158)|
| 0:02:43| inclusive manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=163)|
| 0:02:44| In past workshops, we've discussed KPD's calls for service data, the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=164)|
| 0:02:50| of the crisis intervention team, training academy curriculum, including cultural competency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=170)|
| 0:02:56| training and our use of force policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=176)|
| 0:02:59| Today's presentation and discussion into violent crimes and shooting statistics will help us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=179)|
| 0:03:03| better understand what has been happening in our community and hopefully lead discussions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=183)|
| 0:03:08| surrounding real solutions to reduce crime in all corners of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=188)|
| 0:03:13| So thank you again for continuing the dialogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=193)|
| 0:03:15| And I also want to take a moment to thank Chief Eve Thomas and Crimes Analysis Supervisor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=195)|
| 0:03:20| Joan Crick for putting together today's presentation and being here to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=200)|
| 0:03:25| So I'll turn things over to Chief Thomas now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=205)|
| 0:03:30| Thank you, Mayor. I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=210)|
| 0:03:32| And Council, I really do appreciate you spending all this time meeting with us to let| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=212)|
| 0:03:37| us tell you how we do business and actually asking all the questions that you ask so that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=217)|
| 0:03:44| you're able to go back to the community and inform them as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=224)|
| 0:03:48| I would really hope at some point that we can do some ride alongs once we get through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=228)|
| 0:03:52| through COVID, hopefully one day, because I think that will enable you to see us put all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=232)|
| 0:03:59| this into action. And I think it would be a good experience for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=239)|
| 0:04:02| But putting that aside this evening, we're going to talk about our violent crime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=242)|
| 0:04:08| statistics. And I have our Crime Analysis Supervisor Joan Crick here who's going to go over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=248)|
| 0:04:13| that. She is actually has the data, but we can all get numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=253)|
| 0:04:18| It's interpreting those numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=258)|
| 0:04:19| And that's what an analyst does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=259)|
| 0:04:20| And so she interprets those, shows us trends, and she's going to discuss all that with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=260)|
| 0:04:25| this evening. Following that, I've got Deputy Chief Kenny Miller and Deputy Chief Cindy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=265)|
| 0:04:30| Gass here. As you may recall, Deputy Chief Miller is our patrol commander, and we're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=270)|
| 0:04:35| to talk, he's going to talk just briefly how we translate that information into action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=275)|
| 0:04:40| within the patrol division, the meetings we have both inside and with outside agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=280)|
| 0:04:45| And then Deputy Chief Gass is over our Criminal Investigations Division, and she's going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=285)|
| 0:04:50| give you a little bit of information on how we use that information forensically and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=290)|
| 0:04:55| investigatively, just really quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=295)|
| 0:04:57| So that'll be very brief right at the end after you receive all the statistics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=297)|
| 0:05:00| But if you don't have any questions of me, I'm going to go ahead and turn it over to Joan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=300)|
| 0:05:05| Crick. Hello, everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=305)|
| 0:05:22| Thank you for this opportunity to allow us to present this information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=322)|
| 0:05:27| So if we could bring that slide presentation up on the screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=327)|
| 0:05:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=336)|
| 0:05:38| Can we go to the next slide, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=338)|
| 0:05:40| And the next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=340)|
| 0:05:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=342)|
| 0:05:44| So as she said, my name is Joan Crick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=344)|
| 0:05:46| I'm the Crime Analysis Supervisor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=346)|
| 0:05:48| I've been with the department for 23 years, and I think as a supervisor for over 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=348)|
| 0:05:52| I'm not quite sure the exact number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=352)|
| 0:05:54| But I just wanted to recognize that Christine Mullen has assisted me with pulling some of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=354)|
| 0:05:59| this information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=359)|
| 0:06:01| She's a mapping expert in our unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=361)|
| 0:06:03| And Calvin Cox also assisted in pulling some of the data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=363)|
| 0:06:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=367)|
| 0:06:09| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=369)|
| 0:06:11| So just a very quick brief, some information I just want to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=371)|
| 0:06:15| So for all these slides that you're going to see that are coming up, just a couple of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=375)|
| 0:06:19| that I wanted you to understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=379)|
| 0:06:21| First point is that the date range is going to be from 2015 to August 9th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=381)|
| 0:06:26| That was the cutoff date when we started preparing this information for this presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=386)|
| 0:06:30| And you'll always see an asterisk after the 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=390)|
| 0:06:33| What that's reflecting is that it is just August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=393)|
| 0:06:36| It goes up to August 19th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=396)|
| 0:06:38| It's just easier to put that instead of every slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=398)|
| 0:06:40| Second thing is that what we tried to do is to – KPD breaks things down in beats and grids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=400)|
| 0:06:46| And what we tried to do is to put it into more meaningful information for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=406)|
| 0:06:52| So we set up boundaries, north, south, east, and west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=412)|
| 0:06:55| It may not be exactly what your council boundary is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=415)|
| 0:06:58| But we hope it's close so that the data is more meaningful to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=418)|
| 0:07:02| And the third thing is that TBI requires or gives the definition of how we define crimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=422)|
| 0:07:10| And shooting is not a TIBERS offense, Tennessee Incident Based Reporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=430)|
| 0:07:16| So what we have to do in crime analysis is we read these reports and we code them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=436)|
| 0:07:20| and that's how I'm coming about that these are shootings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=440)|
| 0:07:23| There's just not a crime associated per TIBERS definitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=443)|
| 0:07:27| And that's what we have to go by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=447)|
| 0:07:29| So just so that you understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=449)|
| 0:07:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=452)|
| 0:07:33| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=453)|
| 0:07:36| So these are the boundaries that we have set as an aside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=456)|
| 0:07:39| And you can kind of figure out where your council boundary is in relation to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=459)|
| 0:07:44| And we hope it's close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=464)|
| 0:07:45| But these are the boundaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=465)|
| 0:07:46| We have the north, east, south, west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=466)|
| 0:07:49| And I put on this map just to – and you're going to understand as we get further into this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=469)|
| 0:07:54| it's kind of a breakdown of the population for those particular boundaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=474)|
| 0:08:00| I think everybody has a copy of this presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=480)|
| 0:08:03| So is that true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=483)|
| 0:08:05| I think they were given a copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=485)|
| 0:08:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=487)|
| 0:08:08| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=488)|
| 0:08:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=491)|
| 0:08:12| So first graph, we're going to look at shootings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=492)|
| 0:08:14| One of the things that I forgot to say is I'm going to just look at the shootings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=494)|
| 0:08:18| I'm going to break it down by victim, age range, race, sex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=498)|
| 0:08:24| And so I'm going to do that and then we're going to look at fatal shootings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=504)|
| 0:08:27| So this first one are shootings with victims.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=507)|
| 0:08:30| And if you look over the left-hand side of the graph, this is broken down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=510)|
| 0:08:34| shootings per year in totals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=514)|
| 0:08:37| And so what's the outtake for this particular graph?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=517)|
| 0:08:39| Well, one of the things that you can see is just, you know, the east boundary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=519)|
| 0:08:43| we do see some drops in the numbers since 2015 up until 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=523)|
| 0:08:50| So that's one thing that is an outlier in it or an outtake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=530)|
| 0:08:56| The other thing is that the north boundary, we see an increase most years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=536)|
| 0:09:00| except for 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=540)|
| 0:09:02| So kind of we're starting to see an increase in the north boundary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=542)|
| 0:09:05| and a decrease in the east boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=545)|
| 0:09:07| And if you look on the right-hand side of the screen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=547)|
| 0:09:09| this is taking all that information and kind of chunking it into one little pie graph.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=549)|
| 0:09:18| But the east, out of all those shootings, 43% of them occurred in the east boundary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=558)|
| 0:09:23| and 33% occurred within the west boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=563)|
| 0:09:28| And what we see is we have about an average of seven shootings a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=568)|
| 0:09:37| If you look at it and count all the numbers and divide it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=577)|
| 0:09:40| it's about seven shootings a month with the victim, shooting the victim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=580)|
| 0:09:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=585)|
| 0:09:46| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=586)|
| 0:09:48| So this is a map of the shootings with the victim and just kind of tell you a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=588)|
| 0:09:52| percentage of how many in each of the boundaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=592)|
| 0:09:55| Forty-three percent of them occurred in the east division,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=595)|
| 0:10:01| 33% in the west boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=601)|
| 0:10:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=605)|
| 0:10:06| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=606)|
| 0:10:11| So here's a breakdown of the victims that were shot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=611)|
| 0:10:15| And we broke down, you know, you can look at it a little more in depth later on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=615)|
| 0:10:20| I'm not going to go over every single number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=620)|
| 0:10:22| I just want to kind of look at one of the big things that stands out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=622)|
| 0:10:25| and this has stood out historically when we looked at any kind of data for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=625)|
| 0:10:28| victims of violent crimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=628)|
| 0:10:31| This over and over, you see this age range of 18 to 34.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=631)|
| 0:10:36| Over and over, we've seen this for years on end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=636)|
| 0:10:39| And this, again, in this data is showing the same kind of trend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=639)|
| 0:10:45| And if you break it down, you know, percentage-wise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=645)|
| 0:10:51| the age range of 25 to 34 is 31% of that group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=651)|
| 0:10:56| So all those cases are in the 25 to 34 age range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=656)|
| 0:11:00| And from 18 to 24, we have about 45% of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=660)|
| 0:11:03| So, you know, you've got a lot of that young age range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=663)|
| 0:11:08| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=668)|
| 0:11:12| So this slide here is looking at the race of victims.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=672)|
| 0:11:16| And what you see is a – in each division, each of these boundaries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=676)|
| 0:11:21| we break it down in the little graphs that you see there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=681)|
| 0:11:24| So in the east, you had 88% of the victims are blacks, 10% are whites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=684)|
| 0:11:30| And then over in the west boundary, predominantly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=690)|
| 0:11:34| we have 60% of them that are black and 42% that were white.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=694)|
| 0:11:40| Those were just ones that stood out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=700)|
| 0:11:42| I mean, you can see all the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=702)|
| 0:11:43| I'm not going to read them all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=703)|
| 0:11:44| but those are some of the things that just kind of stand out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=704)|
| 0:11:48| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=708)|
| 0:11:51| So we look at shootings overall, and looking at the race,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=711)|
| 0:11:54| when I just combine all those numbers and add them up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=714)|
| 0:11:57| we're looking at about 71% of the victims of shooting are black, 29% are white.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=717)|
| 0:12:04| That's what stands out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=724)|
| 0:12:05| And then if you look at the graph to the right, on the right-hand side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=725)|
| 0:12:08| all the shootings by race is what's in this graph, broken down by year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=728)|
| 0:12:12| That's one of the things that was asked by one of the council members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=732)|
| 0:12:15| just, you know, kind of break these things down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=735)|
| 0:12:17| So that's why I keep jumping back to years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=737)|
| 0:12:19| and then try to look at it in the big picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=739)|
| 0:12:22| But one of the things that kind of stands out, if you look,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=742)|
| 0:12:24| you do start to see a decrease in the black male or blacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=744)|
| 0:12:32| We see a decrease in the last, since 2017, almost every year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=752)|
| 0:12:36| just a decrease, which is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=756)|
| 0:12:37| Now, of course, we're not all the way through 2020, but that's a good indicator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=757)|
| 0:12:43| Another thing that I just wanted to point out is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=763)|
| 0:12:46| of all these shootings with the victim, in 2019,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=766)|
| 0:12:49| six of them were domestic-related, and in 2020,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=769)|
| 0:12:52| four of them were domestic-related year-to-date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=772)|
| 0:12:55| Now, that may change the last couple of months, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=775)|
| 0:12:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=779)|
| 0:13:00| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=780)|
| 0:13:02| Move on to fatal shootings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=782)|
| 0:13:04| So these are any kind of shootings where somebody died, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=784)|
| 0:13:09| So the first graph on the left-hand side is a breakdown of these boundaries again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=789)|
| 0:13:18| And you can kind of see just visually one of the things that stood out was that in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=798)|
| 0:13:23| the east boundary, we do see, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=803)|
| 0:13:25| that decline as far as the number of shootings in the east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=805)|
| 0:13:28| So possibly, you know, that's down to some of the things that we're doing with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=808)|
| 0:13:32| some of the neighborhood projects and the churches and things, whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=812)|
| 0:13:36| could be having an impact, we are seeing a decrease in the fatal shootings in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=816)|
| 0:13:41| that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=821)|
| 0:13:42| So that's good news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=822)|
| 0:13:43| Now, what happens there, if you look over in the west, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=823)|
| 0:13:46| you go from a 5-5-9 to a 5-6-6 and then a 9,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=826)|
| 0:13:49| so you see somewhat of an increase in the west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=829)|
| 0:13:51| I don't know if we're displacing the things that are going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=831)|
| 0:13:54| but that is something that has come up a couple of different places,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=834)|
| 0:13:57| as I mentioned already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=837)|
| 0:14:00| If you look at the pie graph on the right-hand side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=840)|
| 0:14:02| it's the total fatal shootings in those particular boundaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=842)|
| 0:14:06| And the fatal shootings, 38% did occur in the east boundary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=846)|
| 0:14:10| and 35% occurred in the west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=850)|
| 0:14:12| So here again, we have these two boundaries that are having a lot of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=852)|
| 0:14:17| along the fatal shootings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=857)|
| 0:14:19| And if you look at fatal shootings per month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=859)|
| 0:14:22| we average about one a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=862)|
| 0:14:25| I mean, sometimes you can have three a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=865)|
| 0:14:27| It varies, but the average is about one a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=867)|
| 0:14:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=871)|
| 0:14:32| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=872)|
| 0:14:34| So this is just fatal shootings by the boundaries, the percentages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=874)|
| 0:14:40| Of course, most of the fatal shootings occur in the east boundary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=880)|
| 0:14:44| followed again by the west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=884)|
| 0:14:46| Same thing that we saw for just all shootings in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=886)|
| 0:14:49| Most of them are occurring in the east boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=889)|
| 0:14:55| It's a total of 43.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=895)|
| 0:14:56| If you look at the legend down there on the right, it's 48, the number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=896)|
| 0:14:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=899)|
| 0:15:00| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=900)|
| 0:15:02| Another thing that I was asked by the council to kind of present is to look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=902)|
| 0:15:06| at the cases, arrest information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=906)|
| 0:15:09| And in law enforcement, we call it clearance information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=909)|
| 0:15:12| if a case is closed or cleared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=912)|
| 0:15:16| So I had to pull this from a different location because, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=916)|
| 0:15:20| there's no definition of shooting as far as Tigers goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=920)|
| 0:15:25| So I had to pull something close to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=925)|
| 0:15:27| So this information is just going to be this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=927)|
| 0:15:29| The rest of the information in this presentation are going to be based on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=929)|
| 0:15:32| clearance information for aggravated assault and murders where a firearm is used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=932)|
| 0:15:36| It's apples and oranges as far as the other data I presented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=936)|
| 0:15:41| but I wanted to try to answer the question in the best way possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=941)|
| 0:15:44| And the site, I've listed the site that I pulled this from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=944)|
| 0:15:47| It's Crime Insight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=947)|
| 0:15:48| It's available to anybody that wants to go look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=948)|
| 0:15:51| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=951)|
| 0:15:54| So this first graph here on the left-hand side, we're looking at clearances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=954)|
| 0:15:58| And that top line that you see right there is the clearances for KPD per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=958)|
| 0:16:03| And, you know, back in 2015, we cleared 60% of the cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=963)|
| 0:16:07| and 52% last year in 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=967)|
| 0:16:10| And some people are just like, that's not very many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=970)|
| 0:16:13| That's half of the cases you only cleared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=973)|
| 0:16:15| And, well, look at it in relationship to other agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=975)|
| 0:16:18| That's really, really a good number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=978)|
| 0:16:20| We should be proud as citizens of Knoxville that we do that much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=980)|
| 0:16:24| We clear a lot more, you know, 36% by one agency versus 52% for us even last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=984)|
| 0:16:32| So is it good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=992)|
| 0:16:34| I did compare all of the agencies in the state of Tennessee together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=994)|
| 0:16:39| The closest one, or they were just 36% and we were 52.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=999)|
| 0:16:44| Nashville, Memphis, and Chattanooga,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1004)|
| 0:16:46| I tried to get some other agencies from the larger cities as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1006)|
| 0:16:49| I could pull any city that you want to compare to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1009)|
| 0:16:51| but I just wanted to give you an idea that even though some people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1011)|
| 0:16:55| that don't really understand how cases are closed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1015)|
| 0:16:57| that's really a good clearance rate and do a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1017)|
| 0:17:01| And then on the graph on the right is just overall, all those years put together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1021)|
| 0:17:05| we clear on the average of 55%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1025)|
| 0:17:08| And the closest ones, the ones that I compared it to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1028)|
| 0:17:12| was all the agencies in the state of Tennessee put together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1032)|
| 0:17:16| they only cleared 39% of these type of offenses, aggravated assaults and murders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1036)|
| 0:17:22| All right, next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1042)|
| 0:17:27| All right, aggravated assaults, arrest information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1047)|
| 0:17:31| So your offenders, who are the offenders that are being arrested for these offenses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1051)|
| 0:17:36| Predominantly what we're finding, your age range first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1056)|
| 0:17:40| Again, it goes back to that 25 to 34 year age range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1060)|
| 0:17:44| 63% of the arrestees are within that age range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1064)|
| 0:17:47| The next closest one is the 18 to 24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1067)|
| 0:17:50| Again, that really correlates to the age ranges of the victims as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1070)|
| 0:17:54| If you look at the graph on the right, I've tried to break it down by the race.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1074)|
| 0:17:58| And just for the purpose of this presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1078)|
| 0:18:01| because predominantly the numbers were white and black,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1081)|
| 0:18:03| I just want to focus on just those two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1083)|
| 0:18:07| Predominantly 63% of the offenders were black,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1087)|
| 0:18:11| and 6% were white for the Knoxville people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1091)|
| 0:18:15| the clearances that we did here in the Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1095)|
| 0:18:18| And I just wanted to show you that if I looked at all the agencies throughout the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1098)|
| 0:18:21| we're very comparable to other agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1101)|
| 0:18:24| For these type of offenses, 64% were black, 35% were white.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1104)|
| 0:18:30| That's all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1110)|
| 0:18:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1115)|
| 0:18:37| So do you have any questions for Joan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1117)|
| 0:18:40| A lot of numbers, a lot of facts and figures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1120)|
| 0:18:42| I'm hoping you all have a copy of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1122)|
| 0:18:45| If not, I'll make sure you get a copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1125)|
| 0:18:48| But any questions you may have on all that, we went through it pretty quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1128)|
| 0:18:52| But we wanted you to see numbers-wise kind of how we deal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1132)|
| 0:18:55| how we compare to other agencies and how much we do have in our city or lack of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1135)|
| 0:19:06| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1146)|
| 0:19:07| Councilman Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1147)|
| 0:19:08| Thank you, Mr. Craig.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1148)|
| 0:19:09| One of the slides referenced domestic as a category to describe the shooting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1149)|
| 0:19:16| What other categories are there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1156)|
| 0:19:18| And maybe I missed why you called the domestic category out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1158)|
| 0:19:23| So we had, I think Councilwoman Singh had actually specifically asked for those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1163)|
| 0:19:28| So we did break that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1168)|
| 0:19:31| In either an aggravated assault or a homicide that is determined to be domestic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1171)|
| 0:19:38| I'm not sure how to put this in a nice way, but we know who the offender is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1178)|
| 0:19:44| And we can kind of understand the motivations once we interview people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1184)|
| 0:19:52| So it's not like it's an unknown assailant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1192)|
| 0:19:55| But that was specifically asked for is why we added that in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1195)|
| 0:19:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1199)|
| 0:20:00| And some of the other categories that you might classify those in besides domestic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1200)|
| 0:20:04| what are those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1204)|
| 0:20:07| Maybe drug-related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1207)|
| 0:20:08| We talk about that a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1208)|
| 0:20:10| Drug-related or what other categories would they have for homicides?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1210)|
| 0:20:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1213)|
| 0:20:14| There are so many different ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1214)|
| 0:20:16| You can look at relationships of the offender to the victim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1216)|
| 0:20:19| You can look at gang-related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1219)|
| 0:20:21| Well, it's just some extra categories that the officer codes that Tigers requires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1221)|
| 0:20:26| I can give you a link to the manual that tells you all the different things that the state requires us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1226)|
| 0:20:33| if that would help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1233)|
| 0:20:34| I'm just curious what the most common categories are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1234)|
| 0:20:37| I'm not sure what we're asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1237)|
| 0:20:41| Just off the cuff, it would be gang and drug.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1241)|
| 0:20:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1244)|
| 0:20:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1245)|
| 0:20:46| That's what I was looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1246)|
| 0:20:47| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1247)|
| 0:20:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1248)|
| 0:20:49| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1249)|
| 0:20:50| Councilwoman Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1250)|
| 0:20:51| So I'm just curious sort of what this looks like county-wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1251)|
| 0:20:56| And, you know, I know there may be cases that are in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1256)|
| 0:21:00| but I'm just curious what the most common categories are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1260)|
| 0:21:04| So I'm just curious sort of what this looks like county-wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1264)|
| 0:21:07| And, you know, I know there may be cases that both agencies, Sheriff's Office and KPD,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1267)|
| 0:21:13| work dually together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1273)|
| 0:21:15| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1275)|
| 0:21:16| But, you know, are we looking at the highest percentage within the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1276)|
| 0:21:20| or how does that start to translate county-wide?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1280)|
| 0:21:23| And do you all, you know, I'm guessing you all might share analytics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1283)|
| 0:21:28| but then, you know, how are you all working together?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1288)|
| 0:21:32| You know, holistically for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1292)|
| 0:21:36| So I'll go ahead and respond to that, but I'll have them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1296)|
| 0:21:40| have my deputies jump in at any time because, yes, we work with the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1300)|
| 0:21:44| We by far have the higher number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1304)|
| 0:21:46| I think they're up quite a bit this year over last year, if I'm not mistaken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1306)|
| 0:21:49| but so are we in homicides and ag assaults.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1309)|
| 0:21:52| That's across the nation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1312)|
| 0:21:53| But they come to our crime meetings that Deputy Chief Miller will talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1313)|
| 0:21:59| on Wednesday mornings quite often and actually sit in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1319)|
| 0:22:02| and we talk about these different offenders as do state investigators, ATF agents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1322)|
| 0:22:07| We invite everybody, UTPD officers and supervisors will come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1327)|
| 0:22:12| Another way that we share information that's really good as far as forensic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1332)|
| 0:22:16| information is through the NIBIN system, which is ballistics information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1336)|
| 0:22:20| and Deputy Chief Gass is going to talk about that a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1340)|
| 0:22:23| But, you know, our investigators, and especially with Chattanooga,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1343)|
| 0:22:27| they talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1347)|
| 0:22:28| There's personal relationships with the investigators and even the officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1348)|
| 0:22:32| on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1352)|
| 0:22:33| So, yes, there's good relationship there and we do discuss cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1353)|
| 0:22:36| Is that what you're asking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1356)|
| 0:22:40| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1360)|
| 0:22:41| I just, again, having two agencies, really, I was just curious kind of what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1361)|
| 0:22:46| that collaboration looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1366)|
| 0:22:48| And then statistically, I think you answered, would be my assumption that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1368)|
| 0:22:52| city really sees the majority of the homicides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1372)|
| 0:22:55| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1375)|
| 0:22:56| I know on a property level, they have access to our RMS, which is our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1376)|
| 0:23:00| records management system, so all of our crime reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1380)|
| 0:23:04| There is a new initiative that the governor is trying to start called,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1384)|
| 0:23:09| let's talk about it today, where we're going to get data from all agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1389)|
| 0:23:13| across the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1393)|
| 0:23:15| Man, it escapes me anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1395)|
| 0:23:17| It's a system kind of like Google, where you can put somebody's name in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1397)|
| 0:23:23| and any record from any police agency, which is public record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1403)|
| 0:23:26| across the state will pop up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1406)|
| 0:23:29| So, right now, you can subscribe to this service and you'll get the agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1409)|
| 0:23:34| who participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1414)|
| 0:23:37| But we're going to get CopLink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1417)|
| 0:23:39| Yes, I'm sorry, CopLink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1419)|
| 0:23:41| And so, it's a service that's provided now, but what we're trying to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1421)|
| 0:23:44| and the government office is working on through the Office of Homeland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1424)|
| 0:23:47| Security is trying to get that free for all the agencies in Tennessee to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1427)|
| 0:23:52| 100% participation from the agencies in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1432)|
| 0:23:54| And so, that would allow for information sharing at the stroke of a key,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1434)|
| 0:23:58| which is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1438)|
| 0:23:59| You wouldn't have to pick up the phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1439)|
| 0:24:00| And then, if you find a nexus, you can pick up the phone and call that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1440)|
| 0:24:03| investigator or that officer who did that report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1443)|
| 0:24:06| So, there's a lot of technology out there, and we're trying to all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1446)|
| 0:24:09| communicate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1449)|
| 0:24:10| I think it has to do with interfaces is the issue right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1450)|
| 0:24:14| Not everybody has the same records management system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1454)|
| 0:24:16| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1456)|
| 0:24:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1457)|
| 0:24:18| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1458)|
| 0:24:23| Chief Thomas, if you will, I have a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1463)|
| 0:24:26| First, I want to ask, could you tell me what district Lonsdale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1466)|
| 0:24:31| and Mechanicsville falls into?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1471)|
| 0:24:34| West District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1474)|
| 0:24:35| So, Lonsdale and Mechanicsville fall into the West District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1475)|
| 0:24:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1478)|
| 0:24:39| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1479)|
| 0:24:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1480)|
| 0:24:41| And I noticed that, of course, when we looked at the charts and graphs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1481)|
| 0:24:46| we saw the highest percentage in the East District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1486)|
| 0:24:51| But, again, now I see that there's some, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1491)|
| 0:24:56| bleed over in the West District as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1496)|
| 0:25:00| But, off the top of your head, what percentage of what we looked at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1500)|
| 0:25:05| as far as those numbers are concerned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1505)|
| 0:25:07| would you guesstimate might be gang-related?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1507)|
| 0:25:14| In terms of ag and substance abuse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1514)|
| 0:25:17| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1517)|
| 0:25:19| What do you want me to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1519)|
| 0:25:23| I would say it would be fairly low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1523)|
| 0:25:25| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1525)|
| 0:25:28| About 39%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1528)|
| 0:25:31| And when we look at gang-related, generally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1531)|
| 0:25:33| we're looking at drug-related as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1533)|
| 0:25:35| because that's how the gangs support themselves is through drugs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1535)|
| 0:25:38| So, that's probably a good number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1538)|
| 0:25:40| And then some will be just drugs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1540)|
| 0:25:43| We have home invasions over drug sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1543)|
| 0:25:47| And, unfortunately, people are injured and killed over those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1547)|
| 0:25:50| But, yeah, 39% is what we've got over the last five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1550)|
| 0:25:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1554)|
| 0:25:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1559)|
| 0:26:00| Those were some of the top things that just kind of jumped out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1560)|
| 0:26:03| I needed to get some clarification on those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1563)|
| 0:26:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1565)|
| 0:26:07| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1567)|
| 0:26:09| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1569)|
| 0:26:16| You're muted, Councilwoman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1576)|
| 0:26:17| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1577)|
| 0:26:20| Well, I'm unmuted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1580)|
| 0:26:24| Well, I unplugged my headphones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1584)|
| 0:26:25| I don't know how to fix that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1585)|
| 0:26:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1586)|
| 0:26:27| Now I'm going to fall down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1587)|
| 0:26:31| I know KPD is divided into East Command and West Command.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1591)|
| 0:26:35| Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1595)|
| 0:26:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1596)|
| 0:26:37| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1597)|
| 0:26:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1598)|
| 0:26:39| The stats, though, are East, West, North, South.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1599)|
| 0:26:42| So, how is that divvied out, considering East and West Command?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1602)|
| 0:26:47| So, West is pretty much – East is going to be most of your North and your South.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1607)|
| 0:26:54| It's all going to be in the East District Command.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1614)|
| 0:26:56| West will be South, including any of the East District Command.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1616)|
| 0:27:02| North will be South, including Alcoa Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1622)|
| 0:27:06| It's the only part of South that will be in the West District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1626)|
| 0:27:09| We did it by population and, you know, we looked at traffic zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1629)|
| 0:27:14| but population mostly calls for service, and that divided it pretty much down 275.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1634)|
| 0:27:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1640)|
| 0:27:21| So, you take geographic boundaries and –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1641)|
| 0:27:25| Geographically, neighborhood-wise, but traffic zones as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1645)|
| 0:27:28| because everything the state does is done by traffic zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1648)|
| 0:27:31| So, we try and keep those as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1651)|
| 0:27:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1654)|
| 0:27:35| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1655)|
| 0:27:40| Anyone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1660)|
| 0:27:42| Good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1662)|
| 0:27:43| Councilwoman Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1663)|
| 0:27:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1664)|
| 0:27:45| Thank you for putting all of this together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1665)|
| 0:27:47| I know it's a lot of work, and you guys have been giving me statistics for a while,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1667)|
| 0:27:52| and I really appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1672)|
| 0:27:54| One of the ways that it was organized and given to me was by BEAT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1674)|
| 0:27:58| and I found that to be really helpful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1678)|
| 0:28:00| because then I could look to see what's in my district and what areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1680)|
| 0:28:04| you know, to get more specific with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1684)|
| 0:28:08| But – well, I guess the main question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1688)|
| 0:28:13| there are statistics kept on the city level, then TBI, FBI,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1693)|
| 0:28:20| and then I think there's a national justice clearinghouse of statistics also for crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1700)|
| 0:28:28| And each group does – tries to glean different information from those statistics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1708)|
| 0:28:34| What type of things are we trying to learn from these stats?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1714)|
| 0:28:40| Well, of course, the biggest thing we want to learn is, where do we deploy our resources?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1720)|
| 0:28:45| How can we stop this from happening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1725)|
| 0:28:47| So that's – you know, we deal with that on a weekly basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1727)|
| 0:28:50| On Monday morning, the command staff discusses what happened over the previous week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1730)|
| 0:28:54| Every Monday we look at line by line what happened in every type of crime, property crimes as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1734)|
| 0:29:00| all of our major crimes against persons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1740)|
| 0:29:03| And then on Wednesday morning, and Chief Miller will talk about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1743)|
| 0:29:07| we have meetings with outside agencies and inside people to discuss what strategies can we use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1747)|
| 0:29:13| based upon what we're seeing each week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1753)|
| 0:29:15| We don't wait for the – you know, the federal statistics and the state statistics come out well into the year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1755)|
| 0:29:20| or the prior year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1760)|
| 0:29:21| We don't get those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1761)|
| 0:29:22| We provide those to the state and the feds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1762)|
| 0:29:25| So we don't wait for those to come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1765)|
| 0:29:27| We start acting on the statistics that we're seeing and the trends that we're seeing now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1767)|
| 0:29:32| Is that answering your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1772)|
| 0:29:34| Yes, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1774)|
| 0:29:35| It's – this is where I get really curious because, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1775)|
| 0:29:39| so we see where crime is going on and we don't want it to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1779)|
| 0:29:44| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1784)|
| 0:29:45| In my area of domestic violence, preventing it is very, very different than disrupting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1785)|
| 0:29:56| And the prevention of it could be other things like having housing available that a family member could go to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1796)|
| 0:30:05| before the violence occurs versus disrupting it is having a police officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1805)|
| 0:30:11| or some sort of agent to come in and keep people safe or get them out of harm's way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1811)|
| 0:30:20| So that's what I guess I want to look at is if we're seeing gang activity in a certain area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1820)|
| 0:30:29| and it picked up a lot suddenly in one area, we could look at it as who do we –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1829)|
| 0:30:36| what kind of numbers of police officers do we need to send in to keep people safe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1836)|
| 0:30:42| But then it's sort of like whack-a-mole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1842)|
| 0:30:45| It's like we're just trying to find where it is rather than why –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1845)|
| 0:30:50| what was going on that increased the gang violence that week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1850)|
| 0:30:55| Was there – I'm throwing stuff out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1855)|
| 0:30:58| Was there a big place of employment that closed down a few months ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1858)|
| 0:31:03| and now we're seeing the consequences of more poverty and more desperation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1863)|
| 0:31:08| So seeing it in that way of not how to figure out who's going –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1868)|
| 0:31:15| because if we are just looking to see where do we need to deploy more police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1875)|
| 0:31:21| so that we can see when a crime is occurring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1881)|
| 0:31:25| does that just mean if there's not a police officer around that it will occur anyway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1885)|
| 0:31:31| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1891)|
| 0:31:32| I got what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1892)|
| 0:31:34| And that's some of the things that Chief Miller is going to talk about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1894)|
| 0:31:37| but I can tell you that we do look specifically when things are starting to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1897)|
| 0:31:42| We have a lot of drug dealers coming down, gang members from Detroit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1902)|
| 0:31:46| We know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1906)|
| 0:31:47| We've got people who talk to Detroit officers and law enforcement all the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1907)|
| 0:31:51| because we're trying to figure out where these folks are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1911)|
| 0:31:54| Several of our murders, in fact, I think we just had one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1914)|
| 0:31:56| We went to Detroit to biggle up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1916)|
| 0:31:59| We also – Chattanooga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1919)|
| 0:32:01| We run back and forth from Chattanooga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1921)|
| 0:32:03| So we have some very good relationships with the Chattanooga gun teams down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1923)|
| 0:32:07| So we are – once we see one thing, we start reaching out and saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1927)|
| 0:32:10| hey, what do you guys know about this person?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1930)|
| 0:32:12| We don't – it's not merely deploying officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1932)|
| 0:32:15| It's deploying resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1935)|
| 0:32:17| So that's what we want to do is put our resources in the most efficient way possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1937)|
| 0:32:21| Does that make any sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1941)|
| 0:32:22| Is that –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1942)|
| 0:32:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1943)|
| 0:32:24| I'd like to just see if there are more resources we could use to get at it sooner and sooner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1944)|
| 0:32:31| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1951)|
| 0:32:32| I would like that too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1952)|
| 0:32:34| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1954)|
| 0:32:35| So we're exploring all possibilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1955)|
| 0:32:37| and one of the novel things that we are really having a lot of good luck with –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1957)|
| 0:32:42| not good luck, but good results from is what Chief Gass is going to talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1962)|
| 0:32:46| with our gun crimes team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1966)|
| 0:32:48| So, you know, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1968)|
| 0:32:50| So, you know, once we get to that, please ask questions about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1970)|
| 0:32:53| That's something that we've started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1973)|
| 0:32:55| You know, as we move along, we may find something else that we decide, hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1975)|
| 0:32:59| we're going to invest in this because we're having great results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1979)|
| 0:33:02| So, yeah, any suggestions are welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1982)|
| 0:33:04| If you've got one, let us know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1984)|
| 0:33:06| We're well – that's why community meetings are so important to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1986)|
| 0:33:09| and that's what's hurt us recently is to find out what's going on in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1989)|
| 0:33:14| What are these groups thinking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1994)|
| 0:33:15| What have they seen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1995)|
| 0:33:17| And so we're hurting now with COVID, unfortunately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=1997)|
| 0:33:22| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2002)|
| 0:33:24| All right, well, let me pass it along to Deputy Chief Miller,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2004)|
| 0:33:27| let him give his presentation, and then on to Deputy Chief Gass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2007)|
| 0:33:30| and then you may have some more questions after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2010)|
| 0:33:33| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2013)|
| 0:33:34| It's nice to see you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2014)|
| 0:33:36| A couple things I want to touch base with you about, some of the things that we've been doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2016)|
| 0:33:40| actually for some time, that we're trying to institute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2020)|
| 0:33:43| and trying to impact violence and crime overall in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2023)|
| 0:33:47| You know, one of the things that I want to talk about is our weekly concept meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2027)|
| 0:33:51| Every Wednesday at 8.30 a.m., unfortunately, during this pandemic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2031)|
| 0:33:54| it's not been that – it's been hard to get together with everybody because of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2034)|
| 0:33:59| and because of the area, it's hard to social distance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2039)|
| 0:34:01| because we do have a pretty good turnout of folks that come to these meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2041)|
| 0:34:04| So we have these concept meetings, and what we do is we talk about crime of the previous week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2044)|
| 0:34:10| what happened, what occurred, offenders, and patterns that we can see that we can disrupt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2050)|
| 0:34:16| And what our district commanders take away from that is how they deploy resources that week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2056)|
| 0:34:21| to try to change and alter the patterns that we've seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2061)|
| 0:34:24| That also helps us be proactive in the coming week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2064)|
| 0:34:27| I mean, I think we can be – a lot of times the best indicator of the future is what's in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2067)|
| 0:34:31| So sometimes we can look at that and see where things are trending and get ahead of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2071)|
| 0:34:36| So we look at that fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2076)|
| 0:34:37| So with the help of Jones people who do a great job of collecting and screening, really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2077)|
| 0:34:43| and analyzing the data and putting that out for us, we identify offenders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2083)|
| 0:34:47| We do identify hotspot locations that we're dealing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2087)|
| 0:34:53| And it also helps us address both those issues because we find that offender-focused,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2093)|
| 0:34:59| not only known offenders or people that we know have offended a crime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2099)|
| 0:35:04| but possible offenders in the area, parole probationers, have similar MOs as what we're seeing in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2104)|
| 0:35:11| It gives us kind of a starting base to go in that area and deal with those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2111)|
| 0:35:15| And through that, what we see is an uptick in parole, probation checks that we do on offenders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2115)|
| 0:35:21| show cap offenders who are really our serious, habitual offenders that are juveniles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2121)|
| 0:35:26| There's not a lot of them, but they're pretty prolific when they're out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2126)|
| 0:35:30| So we try to keep close tabs on them, and it kind of gives us direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2130)|
| 0:35:34| And, of course, that meeting has been very successful, and it's been around for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2134)|
| 0:35:39| Coming out of that meeting, one thing that we started looking at was, in terms of violent offenders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2139)|
| 0:35:44| is how do we identify violent offenders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2144)|
| 0:35:46| What are we going to look at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2146)|
| 0:35:47| What are the parameters, the indicators that would say, hey, we think this person is a likely offender.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2147)|
| 0:35:53| He's been mentioned in some shootings recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2153)|
| 0:35:55| We don't have enough to charge him, but he's either been a victim, he's been a suspect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2155)|
| 0:36:01| or even a witness of a violent crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2161)|
| 0:36:03| So what that tells us, he's in the area when violence occurs, or she's in the area when violence occurs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2163)|
| 0:36:08| So we look at those folks because we want to know, because that's a good indicator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2168)|
| 0:36:14| because today's victim might be tomorrow's shooter, a retaliation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2174)|
| 0:36:18| So that's what we're kind of looking at, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2178)|
| 0:36:20| Not always, but in some cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2180)|
| 0:36:22| And so we look at whether they're gang membership, whether the courts are recognizing them as gang members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2182)|
| 0:36:28| if they're active in gangs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2188)|
| 0:36:30| Not only that, but also their prior history, propensity for violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2190)|
| 0:36:34| So we look at those different factors, and what we've begun to come up with is a top 25 offender list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2194)|
| 0:36:40| that kind of gives us those names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2200)|
| 0:36:42| We have a top 25 offender list that we think are committing acts of violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2202)|
| 0:36:46| We also have a top 25 list of violent offenders who have active warrants on file.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2206)|
| 0:36:51| So if we can get one of these violent offenders off the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2211)|
| 0:36:56| we reduce the chance of them committing additional acts of violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2216)|
| 0:36:59| So that list with warrants on file is an actionable list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2219)|
| 0:37:02| They've got warrants on file, we can act on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2222)|
| 0:37:05| The other ones we just keep tabs on, can't do a whole lot with them, but we're aware of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2225)|
| 0:37:10| One thing also that we've noticed of late, and I've been talking to our violence reduction team about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2230)|
| 0:37:16| and they've been talking to our domestic violence unit about it, about domestic violence offenders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2236)|
| 0:37:23| You know, we're seeing some of our guys who are bad domestic violence offenders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2243)|
| 0:37:28| are also violent offenders on other people on the streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2248)|
| 0:37:31| So that translates in both areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2251)|
| 0:37:34| And so we're trying to find a link.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2254)|
| 0:37:36| I mean, this year we had a gentleman commit a triple homicide who was a gang member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2256)|
| 0:37:41| who was also a very bad domestic violence offender.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2261)|
| 0:37:45| So we're starting to try to link those two, because I think domestic violence is a key indicator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2265)|
| 0:37:50| of other acts of violence against other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2270)|
| 0:37:53| Because I think if they're doing that against people they love,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2273)|
| 0:37:56| then they may do that against people they don't know or don't know very well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2276)|
| 0:38:00| or very likely to do that against people they don't like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2280)|
| 0:38:03| So we're looking at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2283)|
| 0:38:05| So we've kind of looked at that, and the violence reduction team has played a good role in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2285)|
| 0:38:09| The other thing to kind of complement that just a little bit is what we're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2289)|
| 0:38:15| we're also tracking shootings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2295)|
| 0:38:17| So when any type of shooting occurs, our violence reduction team takes that information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2297)|
| 0:38:22| we're going out, and we're doing neighborhood canvases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2302)|
| 0:38:25| And what we're trying to communicate to the neighborhood is that we care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2305)|
| 0:38:29| Even if there's no solvability factors, if there's a shooting in the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2309)|
| 0:38:33| we want to try to communicate that we care, that we're concerned about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2313)|
| 0:38:37| because we want to encourage them to get involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2317)|
| 0:38:40| If we have people, witnesses cooperate with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2320)|
| 0:38:44| literally our murder rate would be 90-plus percent, if not 100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2324)|
| 0:38:48| Because most of our murders have a witness, and they know who did it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2328)|
| 0:38:52| but if people won't come forward, that's critical to what we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2332)|
| 0:38:56| So we're looking at that, and what we're hoping with this follow-up gun| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2336)|
| 0:39:01| or follow-up shooting team, we go out door-to-door, talk to folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2341)|
| 0:39:05| and say, hey, did you see anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2345)|
| 0:39:07| There was a shooting here last night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2347)|
| 0:39:09| Is there anything you can tell us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2349)|
| 0:39:11| So that communicates that we care and are concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2351)|
| 0:39:13| about what's going on in that neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2353)|
| 0:39:15| and we think that's critically important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2355)|
| 0:39:17| So we've been doing that more often as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2357)|
| 0:39:19| and so we've found we get a lot of good information that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2359)|
| 0:39:22| Sometimes it's actionable, sometimes it's not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2362)|
| 0:39:24| but information is information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2364)|
| 0:39:26| We'll take what we can get, and so we go with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2366)|
| 0:39:29| So that's a few things that we're doing in patrol to help address violent crime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2369)|
| 0:39:34| that specifically are targeted for violent crime in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2374)|
| 0:39:38| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2378)|
| 0:39:48| Deputy Chief Miller, I had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2388)|
| 0:39:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2390)|
| 0:39:52| You were talking about that program of going into a neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2392)|
| 0:39:56| when a shooting has occurred, and I think that's a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2396)|
| 0:40:00| Is that something you've already implemented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2400)|
| 0:40:03| or is that something you're planning on implementing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2403)|
| 0:40:05| No, we're doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2405)|
| 0:40:06| I think we're doing that about a year, year and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2406)|
| 0:40:09| April 2019 is kind of when we started getting that involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2409)|
| 0:40:12| and getting that going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2412)|
| 0:40:14| And so we've been doing that more often since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2414)|
| 0:40:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2417)|
| 0:40:18| And then I guess what has the – speaking of neighborhood engagements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2418)|
| 0:40:23| I think we've all been to neighborhood meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2423)|
| 0:40:26| and had an officer come and talk about things that are being seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2426)|
| 0:40:30| in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2430)|
| 0:40:32| When you think about, like, walking tour of a neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2432)|
| 0:40:38| or biking through the neighborhood, are those types of things still going on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2438)|
| 0:40:45| Were they more prevalent in the past than they are currently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2445)|
| 0:40:48| And what are we looking at there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2448)|
| 0:40:50| Well, actually, we just started the command staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2450)|
| 0:40:53| walking through neighborhoods now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2453)|
| 0:40:55| We did Island Home, and I think our next one will be in Lonsdale Homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2455)|
| 0:40:58| here next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2458)|
| 0:41:00| Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2460)|
| 0:41:01| So we have been getting out on foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2461)|
| 0:41:03| Our command staff is getting out on foot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2463)|
| 0:41:04| and we encourage our officers to get out on foot when they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2464)|
| 0:41:07| Our KCBC units do walking patrols.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2467)|
| 0:41:10| Of course, we have our neighborhood bike officers who we assign to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2470)|
| 0:41:13| not only specifically greenways, because our greenways are so hard to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2473)|
| 0:41:17| bleach from the street, trying to get our bike officers in those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2477)|
| 0:41:21| And, of course, that includes parks and neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2481)|
| 0:41:23| So we do encourage that, and we try to model that behavior as well for our people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2483)|
| 0:41:30| Part of that has to do with our dwindling manpower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2490)|
| 0:41:33| As you've heard me talk about in the past, we are authorized at 416 officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2493)|
| 0:41:38| We today are at 354 officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2498)|
| 0:41:42| So we are way down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2502)|
| 0:41:44| When you look at the clearance salvation rate, the clearance rate of homicides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2504)|
| 0:41:50| you see them go down a little bit, 56, 53, 52.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2510)|
| 0:41:54| I don't have the homicide investigators I had in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2514)|
| 0:41:56| I don't have the patrol officers I had in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2516)|
| 0:41:58| This has affected everything we do across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2518)|
| 0:42:01| But I want you to – and that was a great graph.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2521)|
| 0:42:04| I'm glad that Joan put that up there because Chattanooga has 500 officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2524)|
| 0:42:09| Chattanooga has 10,000 less people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2529)|
| 0:42:12| Chattanooga has 10,000 less calls for service a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2532)|
| 0:42:15| This is based on 2019 information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2535)|
| 0:42:18| Chattanooga Police Department's percent of the overall city budget is 28%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2538)|
| 0:42:23| minus 17.9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2543)|
| 0:42:25| So I want you to realize what a great bargain you're getting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2545)|
| 0:42:27| These guys are working their butts off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2547)|
| 0:42:29| They are out there on the streets every day trying to make a difference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2549)|
| 0:42:32| and they really care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2552)|
| 0:42:34| And it shows because we have good numbers, even though we have less people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2554)|
| 0:42:37| But, you know, I can't do that forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2557)|
| 0:42:39| So we are – you know, the recent recruitment efforts with the marketing firm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2559)|
| 0:42:49| are coming to fruition now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2569)|
| 0:42:51| So we hope to see that bump in March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2571)|
| 0:42:53| We're running two academies a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2573)|
| 0:42:55| We've got 21 getting ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2575)|
| 0:42:57| So there's hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2577)|
| 0:42:58| I want to show the light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2578)|
| 0:42:59| We've got 21 getting ready to graduate a week from Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2579)|
| 0:43:02| We started a new class of 26.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2582)|
| 0:43:05| We're down to 23, 24 now, Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2585)|
| 0:43:10| So we're working our way back to our authorized strengths slowly, slowly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2590)|
| 0:43:15| But we're hoping to get there pretty quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2595)|
| 0:43:17| So I got off on a tangent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2597)|
| 0:43:18| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2598)|
| 0:43:19| But I want you to realize some of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2599)|
| 0:43:21| No, I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2601)|
| 0:43:22| The other question I had was about, and maybe more for the criminal analysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2602)|
| 0:43:29| in the charts we were looking at earlier, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2609)|
| 0:43:33| you could look at the changes in shootings over years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2613)|
| 0:43:39| But, of course, the current year was stopped at August 9th because, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2619)|
| 0:43:45| we're not into that part into the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2625)|
| 0:43:49| So we don't know what those numbers are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2629)|
| 0:43:51| But what I was curious about is, is there a time of year that you see more shootings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2631)|
| 0:43:58| You know, is it something that's more in the summer months or in the spring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2638)|
| 0:44:02| or in the fall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2642)|
| 0:44:04| Or is it kind of evenly spread out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2644)|
| 0:44:11| Yeah, I don't think we've got any clear trends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2651)|
| 0:44:15| They seem to come in rashes is all I can say, but not a specific time of year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2655)|
| 0:44:19| I think if we look back over the past five years, we would see them all different times of year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2659)|
| 0:44:23| You know, we unfortunately just can't plan for those things like we plan for DUIs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2663)|
| 0:44:29| or parties at UT for all incomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2669)|
| 0:44:32| You know, warm weather seems to be an indicator at times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2672)|
| 0:44:37| Holidays as well when we talk about domestic violence and other types of violence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2677)|
| 0:44:42| when people are together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2682)|
| 0:44:43| That's, I think, why COVID has had such a profound effect this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2683)|
| 0:44:46| and our aggravated assaults and our homicides were up almost 50% on homicides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2686)|
| 0:44:54| And the trend across the country was 38%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2694)|
| 0:44:57| That was a couple of months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2697)|
| 0:44:59| So I daresay their trend is up too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2699)|
| 0:45:01| I need to take another look at the nationwide numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2701)|
| 0:45:03| But it's unfortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2703)|
| 0:45:05| I think people being clustered together and not being able to be social with other people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2705)|
| 0:45:08| is really having some, you know, and, of course, people who have addiction issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2708)|
| 0:45:12| are not able to go to meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2712)|
| 0:45:14| There's a lot going on there that I think there's just a lot of factors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2714)|
| 0:45:18| along with the COVID epidemic that are hurting us, or pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2718)|
| 0:45:24| And I got off on a tangent at the end of that answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2724)|
| 0:45:26| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2726)|
| 0:45:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2727)|
| 0:45:28| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2728)|
| 0:45:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2731)|
| 0:45:33| Councilwoman Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2733)|
| 0:45:35| I had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2735)|
| 0:45:36| I wanted to go back to Councilwoman Singh's question about how the data is used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2736)|
| 0:45:45| It seemed like what was being described was using the data to see if you can predict| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2745)|
| 0:45:52| where future crime might happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2752)|
| 0:45:54| Would you say that's a way to describe what you shared?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2754)|
| 0:45:57| That's part of it, trying to interrupt a pattern that might be going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2757)|
| 0:46:01| you know, a process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2761)|
| 0:46:04| And are you using a specific software program to analyze the data?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2764)|
| 0:46:09| We use LexisNexis product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2769)|
| 0:46:15| It's a tech workstation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2775)|
| 0:46:16| It's not predictive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2776)|
| 0:46:17| It's more forecast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2777)|
| 0:46:19| I've never liked the word prediction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2779)|
| 0:46:21| Prediction you can only do with looking at a specific person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2781)|
| 0:46:24| focusing on their forecasting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2784)|
| 0:46:26| You look at certain crime types and look at, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2786)|
| 0:46:29| what time last year did they occur,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2789)|
| 0:46:31| what time this year might they occur based on historical data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2791)|
| 0:46:36| And that's more forecasting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2796)|
| 0:46:38| And you're looking at specific crime types,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2798)|
| 0:46:40| not focusing on necessarily individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2800)|
| 0:46:43| Does that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2803)|
| 0:46:45| What's the LexisNexis program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2805)|
| 0:46:48| This, I called it tech workstation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2808)|
| 0:46:52| It's actually going away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2812)|
| 0:46:54| We've had it for quite a few years and it's going away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2814)|
| 0:46:57| And so currently we're developing our own internal SQL data program to store,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2817)|
| 0:47:04| you know, to look at the data and analyze it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2824)|
| 0:47:05| So we don't have a program that takes algorithms and predicts crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2825)|
| 0:47:08| Is that what you're asking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2828)|
| 0:47:10| Well, really what I'm getting at is that relying on historical data to try to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2830)|
| 0:47:17| forecast future crime often leads to profiling and,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2837)|
| 0:47:23| I can see deep breaths taking place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2843)|
| 0:47:27| But not achieving the outcomes that we would hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2847)|
| 0:47:33| Crime data is often incomplete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2853)|
| 0:47:36| There's crimes that aren't reported that we don't know about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2856)|
| 0:47:40| And so we tend to criminalize an area if we tend to only focus on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2860)|
| 0:47:45| historical data and try to predict what might happen next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2865)|
| 0:47:48| That was just one concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2868)|
| 0:47:50| I know that there's been a lot of concerns raised about that historical data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2870)|
| 0:47:56| being used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2876)|
| 0:47:58| And it's come about in the last couple of years because there have been new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2878)|
| 0:48:02| software products developed and police forces have adopted these programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2882)|
| 0:48:10| But I think even without the program, just relying on that historical data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2890)|
| 0:48:18| could criminalize, you know, could actually bring more police to an area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2898)|
| 0:48:27| bring more stress and anxiety and all of the issues that can actually create| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2907)|
| 0:48:35| more crime in an area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2915)|
| 0:48:37| So that was one of my concerns with that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2917)|
| 0:48:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2919)|
| 0:48:44| That's all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2924)|
| 0:48:45| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2925)|
| 0:48:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2926)|
| 0:48:47| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2927)|
| 0:48:48| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2928)|
| 0:48:49| You know, if I may, Chief Thomas and my colleagues, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2929)|
| 0:48:54| and I want to thank you guys for pulling this information together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2934)|
| 0:48:59| And thank you, Council Member Singh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2939)|
| 0:49:01| I think that you actually helped generate this level of information being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2941)|
| 0:49:05| presented today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2945)|
| 0:49:06| And it's been very enlightening, to say the least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2946)|
| 0:49:09| What I will say is that KPD could have a thousand officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2949)|
| 0:49:18| but that still would not solve our crime and murder rates here in the city of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2958)|
| 0:49:24| Knoxville and in our districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2964)|
| 0:49:26| When I, you know, and I sit here and I look that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2966)|
| 0:49:29| even in my district alone, but across the city, we have 17% of our,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2969)|
| 0:49:34| roughly around 17% of our population is African American,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2974)|
| 0:49:38| and yet 42% of African Americans live in poverty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2978)|
| 0:49:43| And so I think we'd be remiss if we did not say that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2983)|
| 0:49:46| realize that there's a correlation in poverty and crime that exacerbates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2986)|
| 0:49:51| itself in violence when people lack resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2991)|
| 0:49:55| when they lack opportunities for employment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2995)|
| 0:49:58| and just being able to survive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=2998)|
| 0:50:01| And so there are several community groups that are meeting and having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3001)|

| 0:50:11| do and what commitments can the community make to help curb some of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3011)|
| 0:50:16| to help fill the gap, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3016)|

| 0:50:26| But it is going to take every entity across this city working together to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3026)|
| 0:50:32| able to combat this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3032)|
| 0:50:34| It's not just a policing issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3034)|
| 0:50:37| The police law enforcement has its place in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3037)|
| 0:50:40| and I appreciate the work and the additional strategies that you guys look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3040)|
| 0:50:45| when you talk about violent offenders and reducing, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3045)|
| 0:50:49| the violence reduction team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3049)|
| 0:50:51| because those things are absolutely necessary when you've already identified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3051)|
| 0:50:54| people who have gone into a path of violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3054)|
| 0:50:58| But how can we help prevent that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3058)|
| 0:51:01| And so that's going to take the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3061)|
| 0:51:05| It's also going to take people in the community willing and feeling empowered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3065)|
| 0:51:09| to have more authority for community policing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3069)|
| 0:51:13| knowing their neighbors and feeling empowered to be able to contact KPD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3073)|
| 0:51:19| when they are seeing some things happening or starting to exhibit themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3079)|
| 0:51:23| in their communities that they know are illegal activities and those types of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3083)|
| 0:51:28| things so they can work together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3088)|
| 0:51:30| And I know Deputy Chief Miller,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3090)|
| 0:51:32| we've been working together and we're still working together in one particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3092)|
| 0:51:34| area with that type of issue where you do have a lot of concerned neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3094)|
| 0:51:40| But it's also going to take we as governing bodies to be able to hear what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3100)|
| 0:51:47| some of these strategies are that come from the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3107)|
| 0:51:50| that come from KPD as well as the Sheriff's Department because, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3110)|
| 0:51:55| it's going to take everyone up to and including juvenile court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3115)|
| 0:51:59| We're going to have to have some cooperation from their side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3119)|
| 0:52:03| identifying kids that are more high risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3123)|
| 0:52:06| I think it's going to take the school board working together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3126)|
| 0:52:09| coming to the table with us and the county to look at what are some trade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3129)|
| 0:52:14| programs that may can be implemented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3134)|
| 0:52:16| what does that look like to help kids learn trades to be able to support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3136)|
| 0:52:20| themselves and not find themselves falling victim to lives of crime and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3140)|
| 0:52:26| selling drugs, those types of things or gang activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3146)|
| 0:52:30| A lot of the things that we see primarily go back to the poverty issue and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3150)|
| 0:52:38| lack of opportunity here in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3158)|
| 0:52:40| And so with that said, I'm also going to be reaching out to the chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3160)|
| 0:52:45| I would like to know what is the chamber doing as it relates to diversity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3165)|
| 0:52:50| and inclusion, what are they doing as it relates to trying to help with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3170)|
| 0:52:54| internship programs, helping to encourage Black entrepreneurship and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3174)|
| 0:52:59| Black businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3179)|
| 0:53:01| I think everyone on this council knows the history of urban renewal and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3181)|
| 0:53:06| during that timeframe prior to urban renewal, we had over 100 Black| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3186)|
| 0:53:12| businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3192)|
| 0:53:13| We had multiple Black businesses in this city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3193)|
| 0:53:16| and a lot of those Black businesses relocated out of Knoxville and left| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3196)|
| 0:53:21| Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3201)|
| 0:53:22| And so I think that was the beginning of the decline when we start seeing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3202)|
| 0:53:27| more increase in Black poverty and less Black wealth in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3207)|
| 0:53:32| And so I'd like to challenge you guys to please keep open minds as we move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3212)|
| 0:53:37| forward because there's going to be a lot more dialogue and conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3217)|
| 0:53:41| around what are some of the things that we might can help encourage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3221)|
| 0:53:45| I know that Charles Lomax, Community Empowerment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3225)|
| 0:53:48| they are engaged as well in helping to come up with these potential solutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3228)|
| 0:53:52| And so I do want to thank the community groups that are diligently working on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3232)|
| 0:53:57| some possible solutions to what the community is willing to commit to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3237)|
| 0:54:06| to help with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3246)|
| 0:54:07| But we have a lot of children, even right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3247)|
| 0:54:09| during this pandemic that are not going to school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3249)|
| 0:54:12| that are signed up for school, and they're not going to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3252)|
| 0:54:16| So, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3256)|
| 0:54:17| I think that we're going to see some really dire unintended consequences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3257)|
| 0:54:20| because of the pandemic and the way kids are trying to go to school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3260)|
| 0:54:24| where a lot more kids are going to fall out of the system and drop out of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3264)|
| 0:54:28| school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3268)|
| 0:54:29| And that is only going to lead to more increase in crime as we move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3269)|
| 0:54:33| So I just wanted to kind of put that out there for everyone to please start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3273)|
| 0:54:38| thinking about in your communities when people are reaching out to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3278)|
| 0:54:41| wanting to have conversations around that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3281)|
| 0:54:44| I would encourage you to please take some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3284)|
| 0:54:46| And then maybe at some point we all can share some of those things that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3286)|
| 0:54:49| hearing as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3289)|
| 0:54:50| There is one particular group that's been pretty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3290)|
| 0:54:53| it's involved some faith leaders as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3293)|
| 0:54:56| that actually have some really good recommendations that they're going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3296)|
| 0:55:05| presenting to both mayors and both Juvenile Court and Community Empowerment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3305)|
| 0:55:13| And when that meeting is scheduled, we'll probably have to sunshine it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3313)|
| 0:55:16| but I will invite you guys to attend as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3316)|
| 0:55:19| So you can hear some of the voices from people in the communities that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3319)|
| 0:55:23| willing to step up to try to help solve some of these issues that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3323)|
| 0:55:27| seeing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3327)|
| 0:55:28| Because again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3328)|
| 0:55:29| I'm convinced that we can have a thousand police officers and until we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3329)|
| 0:55:33| something to change the demographic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3333)|
| 0:55:35| the dynamics with socioeconomics here for people in our city of color.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3335)|
| 0:55:41| We're going to continue to see these staggering types of statistics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3341)|
| 0:55:46| And they, you know, where I sit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3346)|
| 0:55:48| it's very depressing to see these numbers, even though yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3348)|
| 0:55:51| they're getting better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3351)|
| 0:55:52| However, I think that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3352)|
| 0:55:54| if we sit here and we just think that all of this is on police and law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3354)|
| 0:55:58| enforcement, we're missing the mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3358)|
| 0:56:01| This is not a law enforcement issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3361)|
| 0:56:04| This is a city issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3364)|
| 0:56:07| This is for all of us to absorb and look for solutions that we can make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3367)|
| 0:56:10| better opportunities for people moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3370)|
| 0:56:14| So just wanted to share that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3374)|
| 0:56:16| I'm going to get off my soap box now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3376)|
| 0:56:19| And I'm not sure if there's any other questions or comments or, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3379)|
| 0:56:23| if anyone else wants to add anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3383)|
| 0:56:25| but I think that these workshops have been very informative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3385)|
| 0:56:30| And today, especially, I think looking at those statistics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3390)|
| 0:56:34| should speak volumes to all of us around what is really the root cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3394)|
| 0:56:39| What's the real root cause that pushes people into some of these actions of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3399)|
| 0:56:45| violence and breaking the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3405)|
| 0:56:48| Councilman Ryder, did you want to add something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3408)|
| 0:56:52| Can you guys hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3412)|
| 0:56:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3414)|
| 0:56:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3415)|
| 0:56:56| So is there still a component that Deputy Chief Gass was going to share| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3416)|
| 0:57:00| with us as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3420)|
| 0:57:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3423)|

| 0:57:05| And what aspect is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3425)|
| 0:57:07| Or what topic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3427)|
| 0:57:10| Councilwoman Parker also had her hand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3430)|
| 0:57:12| Did you have a question about what we talked about so far?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3432)|

| 0:57:21| I just wanted to respond, and I thank Vice Mayor McKenzie for her comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3441)|
| 0:57:26| I just wanted to respond about some of our next steps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3446)|
| 0:57:31| because I believe there's some voices we still haven't heard from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3451)|
| 0:57:35| And we haven't heard from folks who are engaging with our law enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3455)|
| 0:57:42| in the community and hearing from them what they want to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3462)|
| 0:57:46| I think that is an important part of the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3466)|
| 0:57:50| And the reason I bring that up is because, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3470)|
| 0:57:54| my concerns about using the historical data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3474)|
| 0:57:57| my concerns about a lot of things that I heard from Chief Deputy Miller come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3477)|
| 0:58:02| from my own personal experiences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3482)|
| 0:58:04| You know, there was a young black man who was at my house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3484)|
| 0:58:09| and we were standing outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3489)|
| 0:58:12| He was helping me fix my car, and a KPD officer stopped at my house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3492)|
| 0:58:17| He recognized the young gentleman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3497)|
| 0:58:20| Maybe he was showcat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3500)|
| 0:58:22| I don't know what he was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3502)|
| 0:58:23| He was a nice friend of mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3503)|
| 0:58:25| The officer felt that he was in the right to stay at my house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3505)|
| 0:58:32| and monitor this young man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3512)|
| 0:58:34| I asked the officer to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3514)|
| 0:58:35| He would not leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3515)|
| 0:58:37| I had to go inside the house and ask everybody to go inside the house to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3517)|
| 0:58:40| stay safe from this officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3520)|
| 0:58:43| I have a friend who was involved in a shooting in Lonsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3523)|
| 0:58:47| When they called the police, KPD,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3527)|
| 0:58:49| KPD showed up and questioned them as if they were gang members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3529)|
| 0:58:55| They were just in their apartment, and a bullet came through the window.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3535)|
| 0:58:58| They were not criminals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3538)|
| 0:59:00| and it was his 10-year-old son who was involved in the shooting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3540)|
| 0:59:03| So the son, this was his interaction with the police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3543)|
| 0:59:07| Now the whole family is less likely to call the police in the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3547)|
| 0:59:12| This is what happens when we criminalize our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3552)|
| 0:59:16| This is what happens when we say if you are close to crime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3556)|
| 0:59:19| you may end up being a criminal yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3559)|
| 0:59:23| I do not think that every strategy needs to be deployed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3563)|
| 0:59:27| I think we need to figure out the problematic strategies and stop them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3567)|
| 0:59:30| So I just wanted to clarify that as a part of this conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3570)|
| 0:59:36| And I can share,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3576)|
| 0:59:37| those are two examples of my own personal experiences in the last couple of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3577)|
| 0:59:42| years in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3582)|
| 0:59:46| It's not my whole life story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3586)|
| 0:59:48| It's just the last couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3588)|
| 0:59:50| And so we have to find ways to address policies we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3590)|
| 0:59:55| policies and practices we have in place that could be problematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3595)|
| 0:59:59| We have to have those difficult conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3599)|
| 1:00:02| And I'll leave it there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3602)|
| 1:00:06| but I just have no patience for criminalizing our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3606)|
| 1:00:11| I have no patience for SHOCAP, which we can't get rid of because it's federal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3611)|
| 1:00:15| but it is a way to funnel our children into the criminal justice system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3615)|
| 1:00:20| And I didn't even know that kids were being monitored by KPB like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3620)|
| 1:00:27| And I'm outraged because we have to recognize that that does nothing to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3627)|
| 1:00:33| help them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3633)|
| 1:00:35| We have identified them as a threat to our community and have decided to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3635)|
| 1:00:39| treat them that way as a child into adulthood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3639)|
| 1:00:44| That should be unacceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3644)|
| 1:00:46| So I hope that we can create new policies and a new way of being with our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3646)|
| 1:00:51| community, because this, it doesn't make any sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3651)|
| 1:00:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3655)|
| 1:00:57| I appreciate your comments because I think we both want the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3657)|
| 1:01:01| And even in response to Vice Mayor McKenzie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3661)|
| 1:01:03| I was asked what my vision was when I first became police chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3663)|
| 1:01:07| And I said, my vision is for community policing to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3667)|
| 1:01:11| And what that means is each community takes responsibility for its members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3671)|
| 1:01:15| and what they will allow in that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3675)|
| 1:01:17| And we support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3677)|
| 1:01:19| So someday we'll get there is my hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3679)|
| 1:01:21| And we all need to work together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3681)|
| 1:01:23| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3683)|
| 1:01:24| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3684)|
| 1:01:26| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3686)|
| 1:01:27| Councilwoman Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3687)|
| 1:01:31| Here we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3691)|
| 1:01:35| This is also so tricky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3695)|
| 1:01:38| It's like the show cap, the children or the young people that we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3698)|
| 1:01:42| watching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3702)|
| 1:01:44| It's just a matter of how we say it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3704)|
| 1:01:47| Are we watching for them to show their true criminal nature and just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3707)|
| 1:01:51| waiting for that to happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3711)|
| 1:01:53| Or are we looking at them to see what's putting them at risk and what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3713)|
| 1:01:57| could be done to help them down a different path?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3717)|
| 1:02:03| And the way we look at them really affects which direction they're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3723)|
| 1:02:07| to go into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3727)|
| 1:02:09| Looking at when we say, so often we say black on black crime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3729)|
| 1:02:15| but we're looking at just that aspect of the crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3735)|
| 1:02:19| I mean, you could also just say it's poor on poor crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3739)|
| 1:02:23| Or, you know, you can put it into many different categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3743)|
| 1:02:27| We've just gotten used to saying black on black versus looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3747)|
| 1:02:32| crime that occurs from many generations of going through the foster kid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3752)|
| 1:02:38| program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3758)|
| 1:02:40| So foster kid on foster kid crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3760)|
| 1:02:42| I mean, we could go down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3762)|
| 1:02:44| There's so many different places to look at where the crime is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3764)|
| 1:02:49| originating from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3769)|
| 1:02:51| And instead of just sitting there waiting for them to mess up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3771)|
| 1:02:55| it's like, okay, how do we get them away?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3775)|
| 1:02:58| Anyway, this isn't what I meant to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3778)|
| 1:03:00| What I was asking was I'm looking at other statistics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3780)|
| 1:03:04| And one of the things that had concerned me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3784)|
| 1:03:07| and all of these numbers, you know, they were just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3787)|
| 1:03:12| they were coming at me pretty quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3792)|
| 1:03:14| But there was one thing that I had from previous,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3794)|
| 1:03:17| previously given to me that said shootings that were not fatal from 15,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3797)|
| 1:03:27| 16, 17, and 18 were around 50 to 65 or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3807)|
| 1:03:35| And then in 2019, it went to 128 by August of last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3815)|
| 1:03:45| And that was just so noticeably different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3825)|
| 1:03:48| I didn't see that in the statistics we were looking at earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3828)|
| 1:03:53| Have you guys looked at that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3833)|
| 1:03:55| What do you think was going on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3835)|
| 1:03:57| And I know it's just the different ways a statistic can be presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3837)|
| 1:04:01| You know, I wish I knew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3841)|
| 1:04:04| There are more guns on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3844)|
| 1:04:06| There are, I don't have a specific scientific correlation for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3846)|
| 1:04:12| but I can tell you that video games are very realistic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3852)|
| 1:04:15| and they don't hurt when you play them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3855)|
| 1:04:18| I walked in when my sons were playing a game,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3858)|
| 1:04:21| and I wouldn't let them play it anymore because it was just too realistic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3861)|
| 1:04:25| and I couldn't deal with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3865)|
| 1:04:28| I think that there are a whole lot of things coming at young people right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3868)|
| 1:04:31| and they have a lot of frustration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3871)|
| 1:04:33| And I think it's up to us as a community to try and help with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3873)|
| 1:04:37| I don't have the answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3877)|
| 1:04:38| I wish I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3878)|
| 1:04:40| As far as the SHOCAP program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3880)|
| 1:04:41| that's a program administered through juvenile court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3881)|
| 1:04:44| What we do with those folks is we check that they are there at their bedtime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3884)|
| 1:04:48| one of the rules that they have to follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3888)|
| 1:04:50| That's what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3890)|
| 1:04:51| That's our part of that program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3891)|
| 1:04:53| There's other aspects of the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3893)|
| 1:04:55| I'm sure there's education aspects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3895)|
| 1:04:56| It's administered through juvenile court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3896)|
| 1:04:58| So Judge Irwin is very intent on helping those kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3898)|
| 1:05:01| He's not trying to hurt those kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3901)|
| 1:05:03| His heart is in the right place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3903)|
| 1:05:05| He does everything he can to save kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3905)|
| 1:05:07| I sit on another board with him, and I can assure you of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3907)|
| 1:05:12| And we all want the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3912)|
| 1:05:14| We want our kids to survive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3914)|
| 1:05:15| We want them to be healthy, happy, and grow up to raise families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3915)|
| 1:05:19| So, you know, make no mistake, you know, when we talk about poverty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3919)|
| 1:05:24| I can tell you anecdotally that we have a lot of our officers pull over folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3924)|
| 1:05:30| and they don't issue citations because they know that citation is going to –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3930)|
| 1:05:33| that person can't afford to pay it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3933)|
| 1:05:35| And maybe the stop was enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3935)|
| 1:05:37| That's why we brought along warning citations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3937)|
| 1:05:39| You know, we try, and we're learning, and we're willing to accept suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3939)|
| 1:05:44| So I want you to not think that we're just throwing all these statistics out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3944)|
| 1:05:48| and saying, here it is, this is the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3948)|
| 1:05:50| We look at all this, and we try, and we want to work with everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3950)|
| 1:05:53| And it is frustrating with COVID going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3953)|
| 1:05:56| It's very frustrating not being able to talk in person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3956)|
| 1:05:59| I'm not a Zoom person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3959)|
| 1:06:01| My background is psychology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3961)|
| 1:06:02| It's one-on-one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3962)|
| 1:06:03| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3963)|
| 1:06:05| But please don't think we're just throwing out statistics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3965)|
| 1:06:07| and throwing enforcement at it because that's not what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3967)|
| 1:06:12| Sorry, got off on a tangent again, and I want to let Deputy Chief Gass speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3972)|
| 1:06:16| So if anybody hasn't – Councilwoman Fugate, did you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3976)|
| 1:06:22| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3982)|
| 1:06:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3983)|
| 1:06:24| Councilwoman Ryder, did you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3984)|
| 1:06:26| We kind of all went around that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3986)|
| 1:06:28| Or I'll cede my time and let you go, and then I'd like to ask something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3988)|
| 1:06:34| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3994)|
| 1:06:36| For my own knowledge base, we talk about SHOCAP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=3996)|
| 1:06:41| What type of offenses does a juvenile commit that then that requires them to –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4001)|
| 1:06:49| that Judge Irwin might put them on the list?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4009)|
| 1:06:52| Just for my knowledge about – I assume it's not truancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4012)|
| 1:06:57| I know, but I know it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4017)|
| 1:07:01| But I think as we're talking about this and we're talking about violent crimes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4021)|
| 1:07:05| I'm trying to understand what type of crimes is a juvenile committing that would put them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4025)|
| 1:07:13| under that type of supervision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4033)|
| 1:07:16| I would tell you it's going to be serious felonies, some of them violent in nature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4036)|
| 1:07:22| some of them property in nature or a combination of both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4042)|
| 1:07:25| And there's a series of these crimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4045)|
| 1:07:27| This isn't a one and done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4047)|
| 1:07:29| There's usually – they're showing a pattern of committing these violations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4049)|
| 1:07:33| and to the point they're put on the SHOCAP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4053)|
| 1:07:36| So it's a pattern and seriousness of the offenses that really drive the determination on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4056)|
| 1:07:42| Now, if you're asking me for specific qualifiers, I do not know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4062)|
| 1:07:46| But I can tell you –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4066)|
| 1:07:47| We can find out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4067)|
| 1:07:48| Yes, it's multiple and serious is what I'm getting at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4068)|
| 1:07:52| I would be interested if you could just direct me to where I could find some of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4072)|
| 1:07:56| or send it to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4076)|
| 1:07:57| It would be – I think it would be – I'd like to know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4077)|
| 1:08:02| I'll find out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4082)|
| 1:08:03| I'll get it for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4083)|
| 1:08:04| We'll get you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4084)|
| 1:08:05| And it's a program designed to help that child to try and keep them from getting into further trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4085)|
| 1:08:12| So, you know, they don't even take pictures showing the clothing they're wearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4092)|
| 1:08:16| They don't want to stigmatize those children in any way when we start looking at them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4096)|
| 1:08:20| so even when they're involved in these programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4100)|
| 1:08:22| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4102)|
| 1:08:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4103)|
| 1:08:24| It's really like an intense probation where they're really closely monitoring kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4104)|
| 1:08:29| who they're trying to really salvage and get them back on the right track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4109)|
| 1:08:34| But we'll get you that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4114)|
| 1:08:38| Councilwoman Smith, did you – no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4118)|
| 1:08:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4123)|
| 1:08:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4124)|
| 1:08:45| Let me get Deputy Chief Gass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4125)|
| 1:08:48| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4128)|
| 1:08:49| You got put off at the very end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4129)|
| 1:08:50| I got stalled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4130)|
| 1:08:51| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4131)|
| 1:08:52| She's really nervous, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4132)|
| 1:08:54| So what I want to talk about is our Firearms Examination Unit and the program that they use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4134)|
| 1:09:02| So the goal of the unit is to provide a more efficient return of information based on recovered firearms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4142)|
| 1:09:09| service cases, and other firearms evidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4149)|
| 1:09:12| The collection of the evidence provides connections between crimes that were previously unknown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4152)|
| 1:09:18| and resulting in enhanced investigations and prosecution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4158)|
| 1:09:23| So what we're using is a program called NAVINS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4163)|
| 1:09:26| It's National Integrated Ballistic Information Network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4166)|
| 1:09:30| And in 1997, the ATF developed this program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4170)|
| 1:09:35| and it's provided to local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies all across the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4175)|
| 1:09:42| And it's an automated ballistic imaging system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4182)|
| 1:09:46| And as you can imagine, it's vital to the crime reduction strategy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4186)|
| 1:09:51| and it enables the investigators to match ballistics, the evidence with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4191)|
| 1:09:56| and other cases across the nation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4196)|
| 1:09:58| And I'll give you a few examples here in just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4198)|
| 1:10:01| But before it was created, we really didn't have any way of doing the research| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4201)|
| 1:10:06| and seeing how one thing correlated with another crime in another part of the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4206)|
| 1:10:13| So it's been very helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4213)|
| 1:10:19| And what they do is, when they enter into NAVINS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4219)|
| 1:10:22| you have to have two or more firearms ballistic evidence acquisitions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4222)|
| 1:10:26| something that's entered into NAVINS, that are identified as a confirmed match by a firearms examiner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4226)|
| 1:10:32| And we have one firearms examiner right now, and he does an amazing job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4232)|
| 1:10:37| Last year, he entered into the system, into NAVINS, 808 acquisitions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4237)|
| 1:10:44| 808 entries of firearms or cartridges or any other evidence that we collected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4244)|
| 1:10:49| So as you can imagine, we're on top of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4249)|
| 1:10:52| and we're just constantly going out and collecting that evidence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4252)|
| 1:10:56| and trying to make some cases and correlate with other agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4256)|
| 1:11:02| We're able to keep track of multiple incidents connected to an individual firearm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4262)|
| 1:11:10| With that, just a few things that you might find interesting, which I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4270)|
| 1:11:15| We had a firearm that was stolen out of county and used in five KPD cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4275)|
| 1:11:22| The stolen firearm was linked to an incident involving two other firearms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4282)|
| 1:11:27| and one of the firearms is connected to a Chattanooga police department case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4287)|
| 1:11:32| So like the Chief talked about, we're looking at things from Chattanooga, from Detroit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4292)|
| 1:11:40| I would be interested in knowing how far across the country some of these cases go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4300)|
| 1:11:46| and we can link that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4306)|
| 1:11:49| I just didn't have time to do a lot of research on that end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4309)|
| 1:11:52| But here's another point of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4312)|
| 1:11:55| A cartridge casing was collected from a business robbery and entered into NAVINS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4315)|
| 1:12:01| The suspect attempted to carjack an individual while armed with a firearm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4321)|
| 1:12:07| The victim was able to call the police and identify the suspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4327)|
| 1:12:11| The firearm was located, collected as evidence, test fired,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4331)|
| 1:12:15| and the findings were entered into NAVINS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4335)|
| 1:12:18| A NAVINS lead was generated between the cartridge case and the firearms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4338)|
| 1:12:23| which led to a lead for an investigator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4343)|
| 1:12:26| So as you can see, we're utilizing that in our investigations and able to link things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4346)|
| 1:12:32| We have one of our analysts, he'll sit down and do a flow chart of where that weapon starts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4352)|
| 1:12:39| and then how it's kind of gone through many, many different suspects or crimes or things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4359)|
| 1:12:48| And hopefully at the end of that, we can link it back to one or at least one or two people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4368)|
| 1:12:52| or something along those lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4372)|
| 1:12:56| So that's a little bit on the forensics and the science side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4376)|
| 1:13:01| And along with that, we have to have our best investigators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4381)|
| 1:13:05| and I think Chief Gatz will back me up on this, and so will Chief Miller,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4385)|
| 1:13:09| are those who can talk to people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4389)|
| 1:13:11| Because it's really in talking to the right people and getting people to talk to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4391)|
| 1:13:14| where we solve the most crimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4394)|
| 1:13:16| Most of the time we get a good ballistics match and we can do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4396)|
| 1:13:19| but for the most part there's a lot of talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4399)|
| 1:13:22| But we try, you know, everything we can we look for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4402)|
| 1:13:25| Before we were able to do this, and we're very fortunate to have one of the few firearms examiners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4405)|
| 1:13:31| here at our department, before we were able to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4411)|
| 1:13:35| we had to send everything to the TBI for an analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4415)|
| 1:13:38| And right now they are on a backlog of 500 cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4418)|
| 1:13:43| We would be looking at a six-month wait if we needed some information for a homicide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4423)|
| 1:13:49| or something along those lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4429)|
| 1:13:51| We can now get that quicker and faster and be able to show the evidence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4431)|
| 1:13:56| and prosecution on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4436)|
| 1:14:00| Great. Good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4440)|
| 1:14:02| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4442)|
| 1:14:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4443)|
| 1:14:04| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4444)|
| 1:14:10| This is quiet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4450)|
| 1:14:15| It was going to take long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4455)|
| 1:14:18| So it sounds like you're tracing the life, not the lifetime, the use of a weapon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4458)|
| 1:14:26| and it's often linked to a lot of different crimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4466)|
| 1:14:29| And then we're getting to my pet peeve now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4469)|
| 1:14:31| Now it's in evidence and then at some point the police department will sell them back out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4471)|
| 1:14:38| to a wholesale, whatever, sell it en masse to someone who will resell it again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4478)|
| 1:14:45| out onto the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4485)|
| 1:14:47| Have you been able to track if that comes, passes through us again somehow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4487)|
| 1:14:55| That's a joke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4495)|
| 1:14:57| Yeah, it's evidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4497)|
| 1:15:00| Well, if it came in as evidence, we could tell where that serial number had been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4500)|
| 1:15:05| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4505)|
| 1:15:06| If it's used in a crime, we don't release part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4506)|
| 1:15:09| Yeah, that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4509)|
| 1:15:10| Yeah, if it's used in a crime, it's not ever, especially a murder, we keep it forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4510)|
| 1:15:16| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4516)|
| 1:15:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4517)|
| 1:15:18| But the guns that are like there was a big bust of many guns a couple months ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4518)|
| 1:15:23| that there were, I don't remember, ten or more, those would be resold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4523)|
| 1:15:30| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4530)|
| 1:15:31| So we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4531)|
| 1:15:33| We have some guns where they'd be taken for, say, keeping, sometimes people turn in guns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4533)|
| 1:15:37| that they don't want anymore, but maybe a family member had had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4537)|
| 1:15:42| We'll go through that inventory that we have at some point and guns that are desirable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4542)|
| 1:15:46| and we only sell them to-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4546)|
| 1:15:48| We trade them in bulk to a dealer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4548)|
| 1:15:51| To a dealer, yeah, in bulk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4551)|
| 1:15:53| Brilliant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4553)|
| 1:15:54| So and what we do, what we trade them for is the weapons that we carry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4554)|
| 1:15:58| That saves us in having to buy weapons straight out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4558)|
| 1:16:01| So those are weapons that, and a lot of guns get destroyed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4561)|
| 1:16:05| Because I have been, when I was in internal affairs, to the shredding machine that shreds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4565)|
| 1:16:08| all this metal up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4568)|
| 1:16:10| So we do destroy a lot of guns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4570)|
| 1:16:14| The amount of guns that are sold back out, about how much money is generated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4574)|
| 1:16:21| I mean, is that needed on the budget or-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4581)|
| 1:16:24| It's needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4584)|
| 1:16:26| It's needed, about how much it is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4586)|
| 1:16:28| I have no fear because we trade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4588)|
| 1:16:31| So it's kind of a, we trade, so we take the guns that we have that are eligible to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4591)|
| 1:16:38| traded, and we trade those guns to a dealer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4598)|
| 1:16:41| In return, the dealer gives us guns that we'll use, like new guns, like duty weapons, weapons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4601)|
| 1:16:48| that the SWAT team needs, or other types of specialized weapons to keep us from having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4608)|
| 1:16:53| to buy those out of our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4613)|
| 1:16:55| So it all sets the cost of buying equipment, is what it basically does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4615)|
| 1:17:01| And so that's the way, so we don't really sell them and get money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4621)|
| 1:17:05| We trade them, and then, of course, once that dealer gets them, I'm sure they sell them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4625)|
| 1:17:09| I don't know what they do, but I'm sure they sell them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4629)|
| 1:17:12| That's just a piece I would like to really get rid of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4632)|
| 1:17:17| It feels just very shady and uncomfortable to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4637)|
| 1:17:20| Councilwoman, if I could jump in on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4640)|
| 1:17:22| That's actually a process that's approved by the criminal court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4642)|
| 1:17:25| The General Assembly has allowed the trading of those weapons to a dealer in exchange for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4645)|
| 1:17:33| new weapons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4653)|
| 1:17:34| They're actually titled in the name of the city, but there's a limit to exactly what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4654)|
| 1:17:38| you can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4658)|
| 1:17:39| If we didn't, if we did not go ahead and trade those with a licensed firearms dealer for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4659)|
| 1:17:45| new weapons, the law actually requires us to sell those at auction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4665)|
| 1:17:50| So we don't have the option of just storing them under state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4670)|
| 1:17:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4674)|
| 1:17:55| That's good information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4675)|
| 1:17:56| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4676)|
| 1:17:57| Thanks, Ron.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4677)|
| 1:18:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4682)|
| 1:18:03| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4683)|
| 1:18:06| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4686)|
| 1:18:07| Councilman Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4687)|
| 1:18:08| Yeah, I want to follow up on the earlier discussion we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4688)|
| 1:18:11| I agree with a lot of Vice Mayor McKenzie's comments as it relates to adolescence empowerment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4691)|
| 1:18:18| and poverty reduction is crime prevention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4698)|
| 1:18:21| And so we've got a lot of work to do as a city in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4701)|
| 1:18:25| I read a lot about some of the community street teams that are non-badged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4705)|
| 1:18:31| You know, Newark, New Jersey has a nonprofit organization that does, I guess, similar to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4711)|
| 1:18:39| community policing that you mentioned earlier, Chief Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4719)|
| 1:18:43| Have you all – do you all do any proactive or ever done any staffed folks just to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4723)|
| 1:18:51| out, not responding to calls, but to proactively try to talk to some adolescent kids and try| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4731)|
| 1:19:01| to understand the challenges associated with them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4741)|
| 1:19:04| I know it's not – that's not your full job, but I know different cities try things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4744)|
| 1:19:08| and sometimes they're inside of police departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4748)|
| 1:19:10| Sometimes they are outside of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4750)|
| 1:19:12| But how do you all think about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4752)|
| 1:19:14| So we have done that several – we have a safety education unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4754)|
| 1:19:18| We have officers that staff that unit that do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4758)|
| 1:19:20| They'll go out and try to run programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4760)|
| 1:19:22| We had in the past actually done some youth councils for at-risk youth where we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4762)|
| 1:19:27| meet them after school, and we had some money set aside that we – I think it was mostly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4767)|

| 1:19:33| It was back in the late 90s, early 2000s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4773)|
| 1:19:35| I was a part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4775)|
| 1:19:38| And we had youth councils at these schools, at high schools and middle schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4778)|
| 1:19:41| I think we had some middle schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4781)|
| 1:19:43| Part of the draw was we would provide pizza after school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4783)|
| 1:19:46| Food always gets involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4786)|
| 1:19:49| And we had somewhat success with that developing relationships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4789)|
| 1:19:53| That's what we want to do is we want to go out and develop those relationships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4793)|
| 1:19:56| You know, our SROs do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4796)|
| 1:19:58| They are not in the schools – they're there for enforcement, but they are there to bond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4798)|
| 1:20:05| with the students, to give a good role model for those students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4805)|
| 1:20:10| That's what the SRO's main job is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4810)|
| 1:20:12| And Chief Miller supervised the SROs, I think, back when they first started, right in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4812)|
| 1:20:17| very beginning when we first got SROs after Columbine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4817)|
| 1:20:20| They are a security component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4820)|
| 1:20:22| But we want to develop relationships with those students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4822)|
| 1:20:26| You know, I'm working right now with Austin East.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4826)|
| 1:20:30| They wanted officers to come in so that we can develop some relationships with the students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4830)|
| 1:20:34| Not just any officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4834)|
| 1:20:35| We want the beat officers to go in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4835)|
| 1:20:37| So I'm working on that right now so that we can – you know, when they see them out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4837)|
| 1:20:40| in the neighborhood, they feel comfortable – the kids feel comfortable approaching| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4840)|
| 1:20:44| the officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4844)|
| 1:20:45| So that is all part of community policing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4845)|
| 1:20:47| But we don't have a separate unit other than safety education and maybe our SROs that will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4847)|
| 1:20:54| go out and do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4854)|
| 1:20:56| But that's why we like the bike officer program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4856)|
| 1:20:59| You're very approachable and you stop and talk to people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4859)|
| 1:21:02| And, you know, that's – it's just ingrained in our every day what we do as far as community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4862)|
| 1:21:06| policing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4866)|
| 1:21:07| I know other agencies have community policing officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4867)|
| 1:21:11| And I think every officer needs to be a community policing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4871)|
| 1:21:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4875)|
| 1:21:16| Does that help?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4876)|
| 1:21:17| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4877)|
| 1:21:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4878)|
| 1:21:20| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4880)|
| 1:21:23| Wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4883)|
| 1:21:25| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4885)|
| 1:21:27| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4887)|
| 1:21:28| So I'm just mulling things over and pondering it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4888)|
| 1:21:32| So tonight we specifically went through shootings and fatal shootings specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4892)|
| 1:21:40| And in other workshops we've talked about general calls, like volume of calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4900)|
| 1:21:48| I guess my question is – because I don't remember and I don't have that data in front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4908)|
| 1:21:53| of me – of the percentage of crimes that you guys respond to, what percentage are these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4913)|
| 1:21:59| fatal – are shootings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4919)|
| 1:22:02| Does that make any sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4922)|
| 1:22:04| And maybe I just need to go back to data you've presented in a previous workshop and pull| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4924)|
| 1:22:08| that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4928)|
| 1:22:10| The shootings, the fatal murder shootings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4930)|
| 1:22:14| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4934)|
| 1:22:15| So we would have to look back at – we call them 1081s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4935)|
| 1:22:18| That's our 10 code that we use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4938)|
| 1:22:20| And that would be shootings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4940)|
| 1:22:22| But then we would probably also have to look at the specifics, like if it was a robbery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4942)|
| 1:22:26| was there a gun involved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4946)|
| 1:22:28| So there might be a little legwork, but we could go back and look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4948)|
| 1:22:32| I can't give you right off the top of my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4952)|
| 1:22:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4954)|
| 1:22:36| But I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4956)|
| 1:22:37| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4957)|
| 1:22:38| Most of what we respond to are serious calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4958)|
| 1:22:41| I mean, they're all – our calls – and Lieutenant Schaffer went over this a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4961)|
| 1:22:45| bit, but I know it's been a long time ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4965)|
| 1:22:47| We have priority calls, priority one, priority two, priority three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4967)|
| 1:22:50| And those are based upon the seriousness of the events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4970)|
| 1:22:53| And by far, those higher priority calls are what we respond to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4973)|
| 1:22:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4978)|
| 1:22:59| So I'm just trying – I may have follow-up questions that I can't quite get at right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4979)|
| 1:23:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4990)|
| 1:23:11| Does anybody else have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4991)|
| 1:23:14| No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4994)|
| 1:23:16| Everybody's tapped out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4996)|
| 1:23:18| I think I know where you're going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4998)|
| 1:23:19| I think you're trying to decide how serious is our crime in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=4999)|
| 1:23:24| Well, I'm just – you know, when we sit here and we talk about what – well, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5004)|
| 1:23:30| Here's a question I had a moment ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5010)|
| 1:23:33| When you start talking about gang violence related to – and shootings related to drug| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5013)|
| 1:23:38| sales, which drugs are you – what are we talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5018)|
| 1:23:41| What are we trading with Detroit and Chattanooga?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5021)|
| 1:23:44| What are the connections?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5024)|
| 1:23:46| So we talked about last night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5026)|
| 1:23:48| Marijuana.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5028)|
| 1:23:49| Marijuana.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5029)|
| 1:23:50| Marijuana.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5030)|
| 1:23:51| Marijuana's a big one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5031)|
| 1:23:52| And cocaine's coming back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5032)|
| 1:23:53| Cocaine's coming back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5033)|
| 1:23:54| It has been a lot of heroin and fentanyl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5034)|
| 1:23:58| But, you know, meth is coming back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5038)|
| 1:24:02| Powder cocaine is a big one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5042)|
| 1:24:04| Yeah, which is surprising because powder cocaine was big when we first came on in the early| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5044)|
| 1:24:09| 90s, mid-90s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5049)|
| 1:24:10| So it's – I think it's – you know, when something gets harder to find, something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5050)|
| 1:24:15| else takes its place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5055)|
| 1:24:16| We don't just, unfortunately, ever get rid of the drug trade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5056)|
| 1:24:21| So how – I know what I contact you guys a lot about is pill houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5061)|
| 1:24:29| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5069)|
| 1:24:30| That's the serious issue that I'm constantly being – getting a lot of complaints about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5070)|
| 1:24:37| And so what's the volume of pill houses or the pill crimes compared to heroin, marijuana?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5077)|
| 1:24:50| I mean, like, how does that flesh out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5090)|
| 1:24:52| And, you know, that's hard to say because when a person can't find a pill they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5092)|
| 1:24:57| looking for, you know, a hydrocodone, then that's when they transition over to heroin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5097)|
| 1:25:02| or fentanyl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5102)|
| 1:25:03| They can't find the heroin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5103)|
| 1:25:04| Fentanyl's a little stronger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5104)|
| 1:25:05| So they cross.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5105)|
| 1:25:06| You know, they may start out with marijuana but just moves up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5106)|
| 1:25:09| They may move to pills from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5109)|
| 1:25:11| You know, it's surprising we get so much violent crime over marijuana itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5111)|
| 1:25:16| But we're not – we're not having pill trade come in from Detroit and Chattanooga,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5116)|
| 1:25:21| are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5121)|
| 1:25:22| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5122)|
| 1:25:23| No, that's more heroin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5123)|
| 1:25:25| From the south we get methamphetamine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5125)|
| 1:25:29| A lot of Mexico.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5129)|
| 1:25:30| Yeah, Mexico.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5130)|
| 1:25:31| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5131)|
| 1:25:32| That's how fentanyl's coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5132)|
| 1:25:33| Coming from Atlanta.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5133)|
| 1:25:34| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5134)|
| 1:25:36| That's unfortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5136)|
| 1:25:37| You know, that's what we talk about in our violent crimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5137)|
| 1:25:39| A lot of our bad actors right now are from out of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5139)|
| 1:25:42| It's not people here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5142)|
| 1:25:43| But they come here with the drugs and they recruit that dependency, unfortunately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5143)|
| 1:25:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5153)|
| 1:25:54| No easy answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5154)|
| 1:25:55| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5155)|
| 1:25:58| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5158)|
| 1:26:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5162)|
| 1:26:04| Oh, Councilman Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5164)|
| 1:26:05| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5165)|
| 1:26:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5166)|
| 1:26:07| Chief Thomas, this is fortunately not one of our more serious areas of crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5167)|
| 1:26:12| But I wanted to mention it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5172)|
| 1:26:14| I get a lot of phone calls about just speeding in neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5174)|
| 1:26:18| And I know that speeding seems to be part of our culture, unfortunately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5178)|
| 1:26:26| And it's difficult, really, to control speeding without some kind of physical barriers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5186)|
| 1:26:32| Speed bumps, traffic strips, islands, things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5192)|
| 1:26:38| But what realistically, and I say realistically, can the police force do to address speeding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5198)|
| 1:26:46| in some of the neighborhoods?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5206)|
| 1:26:48| So, we have a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5208)|
| 1:26:50| We actually have traffic calming, which we allow two locations per month per council district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5210)|
| 1:26:57| for traffic calming, where we pay officers overtime to be four-hour blocks on a specific street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5217)|
| 1:27:05| We also have something called a speed trailer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5225)|
| 1:27:07| And we just applied for a grant to get two more, which are going to give us data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5227)|
| 1:27:12| The ones we have right now don't give us data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5232)|
| 1:27:14| They're the things that sit on the side of the road that say speed limit is and your speed is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5234)|
| 1:27:17| It's got the radar there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5237)|
| 1:27:18| That tends to affect behavior, believe it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5238)|
| 1:27:21| But the ones we've got coming that we are buying through grants actually record that data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5241)|
| 1:27:26| so we can see how fast are people going and what times of day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5246)|
| 1:27:29| So then we can deploy officers if that behavior doesn't change, rather than sitting an officer out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5249)|
| 1:27:35| We have our traffic services unit that we can send out if we're having a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5255)|
| 1:27:41| And we find that the speeding is sometimes indicative of other issues going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5261)|
| 1:27:45| There may be a drug house nearby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5265)|
| 1:27:47| There may be some prostitution going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5267)|
| 1:27:49| So when sometimes we dig down a little bit into the speeding, there is something else going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5269)|
| 1:27:53| But let us know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5273)|
| 1:27:55| Because if we don't know, then we can't address it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5275)|
| 1:27:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5277)|
| 1:27:58| If you want to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5278)|
| 1:27:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5279)|
| 1:28:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5283)|
| 1:28:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5287)|
| 1:28:09| Vice Mayor, I don't see Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5289)|
| 1:28:11| Oh, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5291)|
| 1:28:12| Councilwoman Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5292)|
| 1:28:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5294)|
| 1:28:16| Are there, in talking about that we don't have enough police officers on the force as, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5296)|
| 1:28:22| Chattanooga or even the numbers that we had thought of, have you guys been thinking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5302)|
| 1:28:28| you and I had a conversation about where police officers aren't necessarily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5308)|
| 1:28:33| or an armed officer isn't necessary in a situation like maybe taking an accident report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5313)|
| 1:28:41| But trying to move resources around and fill those positions with somebody else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5321)|
| 1:28:51| with a different sort of position, not necessarily an armed person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5331)|
| 1:28:58| So, you know, you talk about traffic accidents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5338)|
| 1:29:01| That's one of the things when we go on a severe weather plan or when we went on our pandemic plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5341)|
| 1:29:06| we had people just exchange information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5346)|
| 1:29:08| And go through their insurance company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5348)|
| 1:29:10| And that worked well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5350)|
| 1:29:12| Unfortunately, the insurance companies don't like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5352)|
| 1:29:15| They want a police report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5355)|
| 1:29:17| It's not really a necessary thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5357)|
| 1:29:20| So, you know, that's something we can look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5360)|
| 1:29:22| Can we send our cadets out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5362)|
| 1:29:24| Maybe we hire more cadets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5364)|
| 1:29:26| You know, we're authorized to 12 cadets right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5366)|
| 1:29:28| And those are our folks who are between the ages of 18 and 22,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5368)|
| 1:29:31| who are not ready to be a police officer yet, but they come and they work here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5371)|
| 1:29:35| And they have some enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5375)|
| 1:29:37| They can issue citations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5377)|
| 1:29:39| They can't make arrests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5379)|
| 1:29:41| They don't carry firearms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5381)|
| 1:29:43| They carry pepper spray and baton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5383)|
| 1:29:46| But, you know, that's something that we can look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5386)|
| 1:29:49| Can we send them out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5389)|
| 1:29:51| But part of that, and the mayor and I have talked about anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5391)|
| 1:29:53| the initiative that we start, we have to have people to fill that need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5393)|
| 1:29:57| But we also have to educate our public that they're not going to get a police officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5397)|
| 1:30:01| when they call for that, so that they understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5401)|
| 1:30:04| You know, I know I've talked to you all before about, you know, loud music call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5404)|
| 1:30:08| When people call in, a loud music call to 911,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5408)|
| 1:30:11| they want a police officer with a gun to go scare their neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5411)|
| 1:30:13| So they'll shut their music down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5413)|
| 1:30:15| So we will have to educate the public that's not what you're going to get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5415)|
| 1:30:18| You're going to get somebody just like you that's going to go knock on your neighbor's door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5418)|
| 1:30:21| But there are a lot of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5421)|
| 1:30:23| You know, people call because their kids won't get up and go to school in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5423)|
| 1:30:26| Is that a police call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5426)|
| 1:30:27| So I think this co-responder that we're starting with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5427)|
| 1:30:30| that we're getting ready to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5430)|
| 1:30:32| They're doing interviews right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5432)|
| 1:30:34| And part of that interview process is a ride-along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5434)|
| 1:30:37| And it's not that they're going to respond to specific calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5437)|
| 1:30:40| They're going to, this person, this master's level sociologist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5440)|
| 1:30:44| is going to be paired with different officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5444)|
| 1:30:47| working in the homeless community, working with regular officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5447)|
| 1:30:50| that answer normal calls, different officers to see, where is that need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5450)|
| 1:30:54| Where can we deploy people the best?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5454)|
| 1:30:57| Where an officer doesn't have to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5457)|
| 1:30:59| So it's not anything we have a preconceived notion about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5459)|
| 1:31:01| We don't, you know, there are some good things in other cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5461)|
| 1:31:03| but Knoxville is unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5463)|
| 1:31:05| And we want to respond to the needs that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5465)|
| 1:31:07| So I don't have a good answer for you, but I want to find out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5467)|
| 1:31:10| And that's why we're doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5470)|
| 1:31:12| One of the pieces that I liked in the, it can't wait,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5472)|
| 1:31:16| was, I think it was in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5476)|
| 1:31:18| was one officer watching how a different, another officer was doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5478)|
| 1:31:24| how their partner is doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5484)|
| 1:31:25| If their adrenaline is going, if they're out of control,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5485)|
| 1:31:28| all the human things that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5488)|
| 1:31:31| I think that's very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5491)|
| 1:31:34| Different people have different experiences with officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5494)|
| 1:31:38| because if there is a bad officer, they can do a lot of harm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5498)|
| 1:31:45| And protecting them really hurts everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5505)|
| 1:31:53| When we have good officers, and a good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5513)|
| 1:31:58| I had a traffic accident last night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5518)|
| 1:32:00| The officer was great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5520)|
| 1:32:02| That's a very different, that was the Sheriff's Department though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5522)|
| 1:32:07| Oh, I got to tell Tom that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5527)|
| 1:32:10| No, we don't have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5530)|
| 1:32:12| But, so it completely depends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5532)|
| 1:32:16| Different people have different experiences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5536)|
| 1:32:19| and we've got to get that under control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5539)|
| 1:32:21| Once again, there's no simple solution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5541)|
| 1:32:24| but there are certain kids who are only going to see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5544)|
| 1:32:28| you know, you were talking about that Judge Irwin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5548)|
| 1:32:33| really wants the kids to do well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5553)|
| 1:32:35| I know that he does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5555)|
| 1:32:37| But then there might be an officer that's in their path| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5557)|
| 1:32:39| that just already sees them as a criminal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5559)|
| 1:32:42| So it's who they come in contact with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5562)|
| 1:32:44| that can change this entire conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5564)|
| 1:32:47| You're exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5567)|
| 1:32:49| And I've talked about this time and time again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5569)|
| 1:32:52| my officer wellness program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5572)|
| 1:32:54| that encompasses everything about an officer from mental health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5574)|
| 1:32:57| We're victims of COVID as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5577)|
| 1:32:59| We have stress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5579)|
| 1:33:01| And we, that's when you talked about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5581)|
| 1:33:04| we rely on each other to watch out for each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5584)|
| 1:33:07| You know, if you're getting your buttons pushed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5587)|
| 1:33:09| in a certain situation, your partner will pull you back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5589)|
| 1:33:11| and say, oh, wait a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5591)|
| 1:33:13| And we teach that in the academy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5593)|
| 1:33:15| but we need a little more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5595)|
| 1:33:17| So this program, what we're trying to accomplish,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5597)|
| 1:33:19| we've got a peer support program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5599)|
| 1:33:21| We've got chaplains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5601)|
| 1:33:23| We've got a lot of good things, EAP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5603)|
| 1:33:25| We need to pull it all together and make it work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5605)|
| 1:33:27| And October 4th, I'm transferring somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5607)|
| 1:33:29| who is on our drop plan who has an interest in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5609)|
| 1:33:32| And we just received a grant for officer wellness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5612)|
| 1:33:35| And he is going to pull that whole program together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5615)|
| 1:33:37| And how can we do better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5617)|
| 1:33:39| Since I've talked about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5619)|
| 1:33:41| I've instituted a once a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5621)|
| 1:33:43| you have to do an EAP check-in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5623)|
| 1:33:45| We require a medical physical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5625)|
| 1:33:47| You do a check-in with EAP and just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5627)|
| 1:33:49| I don't want to know what it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5629)|
| 1:33:51| They sign a paper saying they've done it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5631)|
| 1:33:53| We have a truthfulness policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5633)|
| 1:33:55| But that just helps people to realize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5635)|
| 1:33:57| it's okay to destigmatize asking for some help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5637)|
| 1:33:59| or going, knowing where to get help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5639)|
| 1:34:01| You know, we have, I get my button squished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5641)|
| 1:34:04| I get upset about things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5644)|
| 1:34:06| And it's, we all do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5646)|
| 1:34:08| It's human.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5648)|
| 1:34:09| But, you know, when we start to get stressed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5649)|
| 1:34:11| we need to know where to look for help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5651)|
| 1:34:13| We need to have that help available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5653)|
| 1:34:15| And that's part of what I want to do for these officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5655)|
| 1:34:17| because they're exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5657)|
| 1:34:19| One bad experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5659)|
| 1:34:20| we don't see people on their best day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5660)|
| 1:34:22| We do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5662)|
| 1:34:24| You know, and we've all answered calls like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5664)|
| 1:34:26| I don't remember if it was you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5666)|
| 1:34:28| I think it was PARC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5668)|
| 1:34:30| I used the example I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5670)|
| 1:34:31| we have officers who saw,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5671)|
| 1:34:33| who see a mother kill their child| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5673)|
| 1:34:35| and then they go do a traffic stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5675)|
| 1:34:37| I had a sergeant come to me after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5677)|
| 1:34:39| And he said, that exact thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5679)|
| 1:34:41| I was watching your PARC meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5681)|
| 1:34:43| And that exact thing happened to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5683)|
| 1:34:45| He said that hit the nail on the head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5685)|
| 1:34:47| On that traffic stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5687)|
| 1:34:49| And so I've got to find a way, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5689)|
| 1:34:51| to calm that situation down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5691)|
| 1:34:53| and get those officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5693)|
| 1:34:54| my officers the help they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5694)|
| 1:34:56| Because they're the ones that are serving the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5696)|
| 1:34:58| and want to serve the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5698)|
| 1:35:00| and do a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5700)|
| 1:35:01| So, and I'm not, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5701)|
| 1:35:03| I'm not out here making excuses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5703)|
| 1:35:05| but I want to be able to provide the service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5705)|
| 1:35:07| that everybody deserves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5707)|
| 1:35:09| And I want to provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5709)|
| 1:35:11| what our officers deserve as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5711)|
| 1:35:13| for what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5713)|
| 1:35:15| So, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5715)|
| 1:35:16| That's a tough box for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5716)|
| 1:35:18| That's my pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5718)|
| 1:35:20| No, that is very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5720)|
| 1:35:22| It is taking care of them so that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5722)|
| 1:35:24| you know, they're going to take care of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5724)|
| 1:35:26| But it really is a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5726)|
| 1:35:28| to me it's like we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5728)|
| 1:35:30| we have hired people to take care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5730)|
| 1:35:32| of our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5732)|
| 1:35:34| Where it cannot ever be okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5734)|
| 1:35:36| that, oops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5736)|
| 1:35:38| one child isn't going to be taken care of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5738)|
| 1:35:40| and accidentally gets killed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5740)|
| 1:35:42| That's never, never, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5742)|
| 1:35:44| we could never have that one bad apple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5744)|
| 1:35:46| That's where,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5746)|
| 1:35:48| I don't think an officer should go from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5748)|
| 1:35:50| a call where a mother just killed a child| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5750)|
| 1:35:52| to a traffic stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5752)|
| 1:35:54| You know, that would be a good place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5754)|
| 1:35:56| to have an intervention and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5756)|
| 1:35:58| why don't you take the rest of the day off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5758)|
| 1:36:00| Who do you need to talk to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5760)|
| 1:36:01| What do you need to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5761)|
| 1:36:03| And we have done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5763)|
| 1:36:05| I don't want you to think that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5765)|
| 1:36:07| We have done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5767)|
| 1:36:08| So, but, you know, just to make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5768)|
| 1:36:10| that's why I think ride-alongs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5770)|
| 1:36:12| will be so valuable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5772)|
| 1:36:13| so that you all are able to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5773)|
| 1:36:14| and hopefully once we can get back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5774)|
| 1:36:16| to where we can do ride-alongs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5776)|
| 1:36:17| I would really appreciate if you all would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5777)|
| 1:36:19| and you don't have to ride the whole shift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5779)|
| 1:36:21| I mean, ride for an hour, two hours, three hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5781)|
| 1:36:23| Pick an area of town within your district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5783)|
| 1:36:25| another district, you know this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5785)|
| 1:36:27| I want to offer that up to everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5787)|
| 1:36:29| once we can get through COVID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5789)|
| 1:36:31| and we can get out of the wearing masks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5791)|
| 1:36:33| and six feet and all that good stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5793)|
| 1:36:35| Councilwoman Puget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5795)|

| 1:36:45| So, Mike, one question I have for you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5805)|
| 1:36:48| because we talk about partners a lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5808)|
| 1:36:50| but I often see our officers in a car alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5810)|
| 1:36:54| So, you know, I grew up watching TV shows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5814)|
| 1:36:58| where there are always two officers in a car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5818)|
| 1:37:01| And so there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5821)|
| 1:37:03| so to what Councilwoman Singh was talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5823)|
| 1:37:06| there was the buddy system, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5826)|
| 1:37:09| and somebody checking each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5829)|
| 1:37:12| With reduced manpower and the fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5832)|
| 1:37:16| I assume a while back we went to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5836)|
| 1:37:18| because it was cheaper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5838)|
| 1:37:20| two officers in a car is more expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5840)|
| 1:37:23| Do we have two officers in cars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5843)|
| 1:37:26| or two officers going out on calls?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5846)|
| 1:37:28| Because most of the time I just see one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5848)|
| 1:37:31| So can you tell me what types of officers are in partners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5851)|
| 1:37:38| and which ones often work alone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5858)|
| 1:37:41| If my question makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5861)|
| 1:37:44| It does. It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5864)|
| 1:37:46| So every officer is alone in their car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5866)|
| 1:37:49| Now, and Lieutenant Schaffer went over this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5869)|
| 1:37:52| but of course that was a long time ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5872)|
| 1:37:54| We have calls based on priority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5874)|
| 1:37:56| that require two officers to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5876)|
| 1:37:58| Domestic is one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5878)|
| 1:38:00| Any domestic situation, two officers respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5880)|
| 1:38:02| You know, if it's a murder call, an aggravated robbery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5882)|
| 1:38:05| two officers will respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5885)|
| 1:38:07| But in addition to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5887)|
| 1:38:08| if I stop a car, I'm out on a traffic stop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5888)|
| 1:38:11| I call that in on the radio,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5891)|
| 1:38:13| my beat partner, one of my beat partners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5893)|
| 1:38:15| will normally drive by if they're not on another call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5895)|
| 1:38:17| And just to drive by,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5897)|
| 1:38:19| or they may stop to make sure I'm okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5899)|
| 1:38:21| And we do that as a course of our business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5901)|
| 1:38:23| We take care of each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5903)|
| 1:38:25| And that's how I talk about your beat partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5905)|
| 1:38:27| And we teach in the academy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5907)|
| 1:38:29| we teach those students in our academy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5909)|
| 1:38:31| to rely on each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5911)|
| 1:38:33| Things get tough. The learning is tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5913)|
| 1:38:35| The physical requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5915)|
| 1:38:36| and the defensive tactics are tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5916)|
| 1:38:38| And that's what I told them Monday when they started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5918)|
| 1:38:40| You know, hang in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5920)|
| 1:38:42| We're going to teach you how to rely on each other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5922)|
| 1:38:44| because this is what you'll do in the field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5924)|
| 1:38:46| And you're going to take care of each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5926)|
| 1:38:48| And I had a great beat partner when I first started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5928)|
| 1:38:50| And we still talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5930)|
| 1:38:52| It's, you know, 27 years later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5932)|
| 1:38:54| And we laugh about sometimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5934)|
| 1:38:56| when I had to pull him by the collar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5936)|
| 1:38:58| and say, whoa, wait a second, and vice versa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5938)|
| 1:39:00| You know, I've had my career saved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5940)|
| 1:39:02| by an officer who said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5942)|
| 1:39:04| you're too emotionally involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5944)|
| 1:39:06| And that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5946)|
| 1:39:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5948)|
| 1:39:10| But I also think that that thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5950)|
| 1:39:12| that you're talking about often means| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5952)|
| 1:39:14| why people see two cars at something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5954)|
| 1:39:16| and begin to think that's an over-enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5956)|
| 1:39:19| I do think there's a lack of community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5959)|
| 1:39:22| I mean, I've heard that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5962)|
| 1:39:24| You know, we've heard that on some other calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5964)|
| 1:39:26| that a bunch of cars show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5966)|
| 1:39:29| And I can see how a community member could see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5969)|
| 1:39:33| oh, my gosh, there are two police cars here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5973)|
| 1:39:34| not how many officers are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5974)|
| 1:39:37| So that's just an unfortunate side experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5977)|
| 1:39:43| that people might see with two cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5983)|
| 1:39:45| But I understand why we do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5985)|
| 1:39:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5987)|
| 1:39:49| And part of that, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5989)|
| 1:39:51| you know, we offer our Citizens Police Academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5991)|
| 1:39:53| When I worked in internal affairs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5993)|
| 1:39:55| that was one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5995)|
| 1:39:57| When people would call in to complain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5997)|
| 1:39:59| I'd say, please come to our Citizens Police Academy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=5999)|
| 1:40:01| because we'd love to show you why we do what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=6001)|
| 1:40:02| And education is huge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=6002)|
| 1:40:04| It's huge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=6004)|
| 1:40:06| And Chief Miller, as you were saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=6006)|
| 1:40:08| we get complaints, there's two carloads of cops out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=6008)|
| 1:40:10| Well, that's really just two police officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=6010)|
| 1:40:12| Well, I know, but we've heard that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=6012)|
| 1:40:14| And I think one of the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=6014)|
| 1:40:16| that we're talking about entirely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=6016)|
| 1:40:18| that talks about what Vice Mayor McKenzie| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=6018)|
| 1:40:21| and everybody's talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=6021)|
| 1:40:23| is there's got to be better understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=6023)|
| 1:40:25| on both sides about why things are the way they are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=6025)|
| 1:40:29| and then how do you dig deeper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=6029)|
| 1:40:30| to solve for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=6030)|
| 1:40:32| And no one agency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=6032)|
| 1:40:34| or no one department can fix all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=6034)|
| 1:40:37| But what role does each person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=6037)|
| 1:40:40| in our community have to play?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=6040)|
| 1:40:42| So I appreciate the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=6042)|
| 1:40:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=6044)|
| 1:40:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=6045)|
| 1:40:46| I do as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=6046)|
| 1:40:48| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=6048)|
| 1:40:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=6050)|
| 1:40:52| That's all we've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=6052)|
| 1:40:54| unless anybody else has anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=6054)|
| 1:40:58| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=6058)|
| 1:40:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=6059)|
| 1:41:01| Well, if there are no more questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=6061)|
| 1:41:03| and I'm moving around, so guys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=6063)|
| 1:41:05| please excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=6065)|
| 1:41:06| There are no more questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=6066)|
| 1:41:08| for Chief Thomas and her staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=6068)|
| 1:41:10| We just want to thank you guys for your time today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=6070)|

| 1:41:14| the presentation and the information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=6074)|
| 1:41:16| presented to us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=6076)|
| 1:41:18| And we look forward to continuing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=6078)|
| 1:41:20| to work very closely with you moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=6080)|
| 1:41:22| Mr. Johnson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=6082)|
| 1:41:24| I think we have public forum next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=6084)|
| 1:41:26| Do we have anyone signed up to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=6086)|
| 1:41:27| Yes, Vice Mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=6087)|
| 1:41:29| we have Mr. Rick Held| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200917-kpd?start=6089)|
