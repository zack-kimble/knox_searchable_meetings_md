| 0:00:00| There have been several questions asked about when we start zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=0)|
| 0:00:05| Zonings are at 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=5)|
| 0:00:06| We had 5 o'clock last time because it was a Friday and we had moved it up just so we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=6)|
| 0:00:12| could accommodate everyone's schedules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=12)|
| 0:00:14| So that was kind of an anomaly and not the norm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=14)|
| 0:00:16| The norm is 6 o'clock and that's when we have zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=16)|
| 0:00:20| Happy hours in 20 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=20)|
| 0:00:23| Just keeping everyone informed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=23)|
| 0:00:24| Who's doing the karaoke?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=24)|
| 0:00:27| Karaoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=27)|
| 0:00:28| Okay, commissioners, if you'll take your seats, let's get underway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=28)|
| 0:00:34| Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=34)|
| 0:00:38| Page 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=38)|
| 0:00:40| This is Resolution 301, consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=40)|
| 0:00:46| Tennessee regarding the distribution of proceeds from property forfeited as a result of criminal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=46)|
| 0:00:50| activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=50)|
| 0:00:52| Resolution 301.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=52)|
| 0:00:54| Someone had asked that this be taken off of consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=54)|
| 0:00:56| Yes, Commissioner Braws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=56)|
| 0:01:01| I had a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=61)|
| 0:01:06| When I read this, it said that the proceeds from the property forfeited go to the Sheriff's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=66)|
| 0:01:13| Department, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=73)|
| 0:01:17| Carlton Bryant with the Knox County Sheriff's Office, 400 Main Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=77)|
| 0:01:21| Yes ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=81)|
| 0:01:23| About how much per year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=83)|
| 0:01:29| How much was it last year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=89)|
| 0:01:30| We had none last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=90)|
| 0:01:33| This is a provision in the statute wherein the legislators have recognized that taking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=93)|
| 0:01:39| both the proceeds and conveyances and anything else associated with criminal activity helps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=99)|
| 0:01:45| deter crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=105)|
| 0:01:47| In the past, in order to follow this statute, General Nichols would have to go to Chancery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=107)|
| 0:01:54| Court, get the property forfeited, and it would go to the state of Tennessee and no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=114)|
| 0:01:58| one would benefit locally and it really wasn't financially wise to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=118)|
| 0:02:03| There's a provision in the statute that allows you all to pass either a resolution or an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=123)|
| 0:02:07| ordinance whereby that money comes from the state back to the county general fund earmarked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=127)|
| 0:02:16| for law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=136)|
| 0:02:18| It's part of a judicial proceeding and the judge would of course have to make a determination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=138)|
| 0:02:22| as to whether or not the property is indeed forfeitable and then how it needs to be distributed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=142)|
| 0:02:29| General Nichols would be compensated for time under the statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=149)|
| 0:02:34| But we've seized a large number of vehicles for drug related activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=154)|
| 0:02:40| We've seized cash for drug activity and for DUI stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=160)|
| 0:02:45| This broadens what we're able to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=165)|
| 0:02:48| I'm wondering how much that's been in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=168)|
| 0:02:54| We haven't had any in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=174)|
| 0:02:56| So in the past it's all gone to the state?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=176)|
| 0:02:59| We've done none of this type of seizing and forfeiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=179)|
| 0:03:03| So this is something that's entirely new?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=183)|
| 0:03:05| Yes ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=185)|
| 0:03:07| Can you speculate as to how much it might possibly be based on...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=187)|
| 0:03:11| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=191)|
| 0:03:13| Because I'm just wondering how much this is going to be because as we're saying that it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=193)|
| 0:03:17| all going to go straight to the sheriff's department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=197)|
| 0:03:18| Well, are we talking a couple thousand dollars a year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=198)|
| 0:03:22| Are we talking a couple hundred thousand, a couple million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=202)|
| 0:03:25| And how is that going to impact the sheriff's budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=205)|
| 0:03:28| And do we need to offset that somewhere else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=208)|
| 0:03:31| Can we get better coffee up here for that money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=211)|
| 0:03:36| I guess I'm looking for a plan here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=216)|
| 0:03:39| Starbucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=219)|
| 0:03:41| If I could while he's conferring, it would be, let's say somebody bought a house as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=221)|
| 0:03:46| result of their criminal activity and the judge offered it forfeited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=226)|
| 0:03:49| It's kind of like the IRS taking everything that was gained from and then normally that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=229)|
| 0:03:54| would go back to the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=234)|
| 0:03:55| Now this is a provision in state law that allows it to come back to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=235)|
| 0:03:58| Right, and I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=238)|
| 0:03:59| There's no way to determine what it's going to be on a year to year basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=239)|
| 0:04:02| Okay, so can I ask then for after this has been in place for a year that you come report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=242)|
| 0:04:08| back to us how much the money, how much you collected and then what you used it for so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=248)|
| 0:04:13| that we can determine at that time if we need to make adjustments to the sheriff's budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=253)|
| 0:04:18| or as a result of how much you get or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=258)|
| 0:04:25| Is that okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=265)|
| 0:04:26| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=266)|
| 0:04:27| And keep in mind, this is all done in an open court and it's all public record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=267)|
| 0:04:32| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=272)|
| 0:04:33| So, but I would be more than happy to report back at next January as to how we've.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=273)|
| 0:04:37| Well, I would love to see how well this works and how much we're able to recover for local| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=277)|
| 0:04:43| law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=283)|
| 0:04:44| I think it's a great plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=284)|
| 0:04:45| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=285)|
| 0:04:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=286)|
| 0:04:47| Make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=287)|
| 0:04:48| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=288)|
| 0:04:49| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=289)|
| 0:04:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=290)|
| 0:04:51| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=291)|
| 0:04:52| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=292)|
| 0:04:53| I'm over on this side and I was getting a soft drink when you first spoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=293)|
| 0:04:59| Your name is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=299)|
| 0:05:01| My name is Carlton Bryan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=301)|
| 0:05:02| I'm one of the attorneys on staff with Sheriff Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=302)|
| 0:05:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=304)|
| 0:05:06| I wanted to make sure I didn't completely understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=306)|
| 0:05:09| I wanted to make sure your last name was not right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=309)|
| 0:05:12| Oh, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=312)|
| 0:05:13| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=313)|
| 0:05:14| It's Bryan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=314)|
| 0:05:15| It's B-R-Y-A-N-T.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=315)|
| 0:05:16| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=316)|
| 0:05:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=317)|
| 0:05:18| The motion is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=318)|
| 0:05:19| Is there any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=319)|
| 0:05:21| If not, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=321)|
| 0:05:23| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=323)|
| 0:05:24| All those opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=324)|
| 0:05:25| Next item, it passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=325)|
| 0:05:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=326)|
| 0:05:27| On page three, consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=327)|
| 0:05:32| approving a contract with Goodwill Industries Knoxville to provide comprehensive recycling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=332)|
| 0:05:36| and reuse services at the Knoxville Convenience Centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=336)|
| 0:05:39| This is Resolution 404.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=339)|
| 0:05:41| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=341)|
| 0:05:42| Motion approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=342)|
| 0:05:43| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=343)|
| 0:05:44| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=344)|
| 0:05:45| And Commissioner Brown, I believe you had asked this to be pulled off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=345)|
| 0:05:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=346)|
| 0:05:47| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=347)|
| 0:05:48| The only reason that I asked for it to be pulled off was because I would like for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=348)|
| 0:05:53| folks who are watching at home who maybe didn't see the workshop last week to understand what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=353)|
| 0:05:58| this program is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=358)|
| 0:06:00| We've had a couple of times at various convenience centers a one-day deal where they could bring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=360)|
| 0:06:08| these items in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=368)|
| 0:06:10| But we understand this now, Mr. Vanderveet, that this can be done on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=370)|
| 0:06:15| Is this correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=375)|
| 0:06:16| And could you elaborate again what types of items can be brought in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=376)|
| 0:06:21| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=381)|
| 0:06:22| I'd be delighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=382)|
| 0:06:23| We've had an arrangement with Goodwill at three centers, Halls, Dutchtown, and John| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=383)|
| 0:06:30| Sevier for five years to assist with recycling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=390)|
| 0:06:34| This is an extension of that contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=394)|
| 0:06:36| It's going to expand the scope of those services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=396)|
| 0:06:38| They are going to have collection centers, just general collection centers for any item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=398)|
| 0:06:44| of value that people might want to bring in at all three centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=404)|
| 0:06:47| And they're also going to expand their services at all three centers to include e-waste.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=407)|
| 0:06:51| People typically think of computers, but e-waste is basically anything with a power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=411)|
| 0:06:55| cord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=415)|
| 0:06:56| And that's everything from a waffle iron to an old computer monitor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=416)|
| 0:07:00| It means a lot to us because those are big, bulky, and heavy items that tend otherwise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=420)|
| 0:07:04| to fill up compactors and cost the county money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=424)|
| 0:07:07| This way we're able to divert them from the waste stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=427)|
| 0:07:10| Goodwill is able to resell those items and support the work that they do, and everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=430)|
| 0:07:16| comes out a winner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=436)|
| 0:07:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=438)|
| 0:07:19| I've had two or three questions asked from my constituents about this since the last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=439)|
| 0:07:25| big one a month or so ago down on the west side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=445)|
| 0:07:30| And I think, as I said, that's why I wanted to be sure we get this information out to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=450)|
| 0:07:34| all of the Nosh County residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=454)|
| 0:07:36| They know they have a place to take this now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=456)|
| 0:07:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=459)|
| 0:07:40| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=460)|
| 0:07:41| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=461)|
| 0:07:42| And continuing on Commissioner Brown's track, this is currently at three sites or three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=462)|
| 0:07:49| recycling centers, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=469)|
| 0:07:50| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=470)|
| 0:07:51| Or three convenience centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=471)|
| 0:07:53| Three convenience centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=473)|
| 0:07:54| Halls, Dutchtown, and John Sevier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=474)|
| 0:07:57| Is there any thought to expanding it to other convenience centers that now have space more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=477)|
| 0:08:04| than what they had in years gone by?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=484)|
| 0:08:06| Over time, yes, sir, we'd like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=486)|
| 0:08:08| It's a little function of budget to some extent, but over time we'd like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=488)|
| 0:08:12| And in the interim, as Commissioner Brown alluded to, just the single day events where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=492)|
| 0:08:17| we collect e-waste, particularly computers these days, everybody is on their fourth or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=497)|
| 0:08:22| fifth or sixth generation of home computer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=502)|
| 0:08:25| Those have been very successful as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=505)|
| 0:08:27| So if there's a center in particular that anybody would like for us to do an e-waste| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=507)|
| 0:08:32| event at, we'll be glad to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=512)|
| 0:08:34| We can do a one-day event and promote it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=514)|
| 0:08:36| And that might serve in the near term until we're able to expand the services beyond these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=516)|
| 0:08:42| three centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=522)|
| 0:08:44| At these three centers for the e-waste, is it stored or is it out in the open during| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=524)|
| 0:08:51| the week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=531)|
| 0:08:52| What's the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=532)|
| 0:08:53| That Goodwill is responsible for the handling of it, but it's typically stored inside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=533)|
| 0:08:58| For instance, at Dutchtown, they have a small building on site and they just pack everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=538)|
| 0:09:03| in there and then they haul it to their main center as they see fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=543)|
| 0:09:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=549)|
| 0:09:10| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=550)|
| 0:09:11| Commissioner Brown, did you, or Commissioner Shouse, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=551)|
| 0:09:15| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=555)|
| 0:09:16| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=556)|
| 0:09:17| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=557)|
| 0:09:18| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=558)|
| 0:09:19| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=559)|
| 0:09:20| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=560)|
| 0:09:21| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=561)|
| 0:09:22| On page four, consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=562)|
| 0:09:26| requesting that the Knox County Law Director advise the Knox County Commission on a monthly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=566)|
| 0:09:30| basis as to the status of the TBI investigation of former Knox County Trustee employee John| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=570)|
| 0:09:35| Hahn and the status of efforts to recover public monies alleged to have been misappropriated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=575)|
| 0:09:41| by and or improperly paid to John Hahn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=581)|
| 0:09:43| This is Resolution 902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=583)|
| 0:09:44| I'm going to make a motion that we approve with a slight amendment, and that is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=584)|
| 0:09:49| we ask our Law Director to send a copy or a letter to our Attorney General and to our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=589)|
| 0:09:54| Finance Director asking them to keep us advised on a monthly basis of any change in the investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=594)|
| 0:10:00| So I'll make a motion that we approve with that slight amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=600)|
| 0:10:02| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=602)|

| 0:10:09| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=609)|
| 0:10:10| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=610)|
| 0:10:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=611)|
| 0:10:12| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=612)|
| 0:10:13| I need to read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=613)|
| 0:10:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=614)|
| 0:10:15| She's going to read number 904, but I think we said that we don't need to do it, but we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=615)|
| 0:10:20| need to read it anyway and formally do something with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=620)|
| 0:10:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=623)|
| 0:10:24| Resolution 904 on page four, consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=624)|
| 0:10:28| County, Tennessee, requesting that Knox County Mayor amend the Knox County Employee Handbook| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=628)|
| 0:10:32| to add a section to preclude Knox County from remitting severance payments to county employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=632)|
| 0:10:39| for work not performed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=639)|
| 0:10:43| Make a motion to withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=643)|
| 0:10:44| I guess you have to withdraw, don't you, Larry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=644)|
| 0:10:46| I'll make a motion to withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=646)|
| 0:10:47| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=647)|
| 0:10:48| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=648)|
| 0:10:49| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=649)|
| 0:10:50| I guess the only thing that I would like somehow is to get some kind of correspondence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=650)|
| 0:10:55| out to the fee offices asking for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=655)|
| 0:10:59| So I know the law director said the ordinance wasn't necessarily the proper place for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=659)|
| 0:11:05| but I still would like to get that out somehow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=665)|
| 0:11:08| I don't know if we can disempower the chair to do something of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=668)|
| 0:11:14| Yes, that would be most appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=674)|
| 0:11:16| I'll be happy to do that, Jolie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=676)|
| 0:11:17| If you'd make a note, let's send out a letter to the fee offices asking for that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=677)|
| 0:11:21| So we'll get that out promptly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=681)|
| 0:11:24| Commissioner Burwells?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=684)|
| 0:11:25| I think it shouldn't just be the fee offices, but also the courts, anyone who's employed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=685)|
| 0:11:31| on Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=691)|
| 0:11:32| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=692)|
| 0:11:33| Okay, we'll...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=693)|
| 0:11:34| Both clerk and clerk, consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=694)|
| 0:11:35| So Jolie, if you'll make a note of that, we'll get that letter out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=695)|
| 0:11:37| We'll also send you all a copy so that you see a copy of what's been written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=697)|
| 0:11:42| So the motion was to withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=702)|
| 0:11:44| Those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=704)|
| 0:11:45| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=705)|
| 0:11:46| No opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=706)|
| 0:11:47| We'll go to the next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=707)|
| 0:11:48| On page five, consideration of a resolution of the commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=708)|
| 0:11:52| authorizing an expenditure of $20,000 from the public improvement fund for renovations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=712)|

| 0:12:02| which the Knox County Drug Court desires to relocate its operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=722)|
| 0:12:07| This is resolution 906.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=727)|
| 0:12:09| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=729)|
| 0:12:10| I have a question for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=730)|
| 0:12:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=732)|
| 0:12:13| Has they come back with any contract or anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=733)|
| 0:12:17| Is there a motion to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=737)|
| 0:12:18| I make a motion to table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=738)|
| 0:12:19| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=739)|
| 0:12:20| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=740)|
| 0:12:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=741)|
| 0:12:22| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=742)|
| 0:12:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=743)|
| 0:12:24| So the motion is to table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=744)|
| 0:12:25| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=745)|
| 0:12:26| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=746)|
| 0:12:27| No opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=747)|

| 0:12:30| Other business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=750)|
| 0:12:31| Under other business, discussion regarding the Pam Rees report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=751)|
| 0:12:36| That was tabled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=756)|
| 0:12:37| That was tabled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=757)|
| 0:12:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=758)|
| 0:12:39| Next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=759)|
| 0:12:40| Mr. Chairman, while we're shuffling paper, as the chair of the committee, I would like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=760)|
| 0:12:46| As I've said earlier, I've attended several school board meetings, and I'd like for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=766)|
| 0:12:50| to pause just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=770)|
| 0:12:52| Ms. Gloria Dethrich is over near the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=772)|
| 0:12:55| Please stand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=775)|
| 0:12:58| I'd like to recognize her as a member of the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=778)|
| 0:13:01| Well, thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=781)|
| 0:13:06| She's a glutton for punishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=786)|
| 0:13:12| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=792)|
| 0:13:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=793)|
| 0:13:14| Page six, discussion regarding Knox County's false alarm policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=794)|
| 0:13:18| Mr. Shouse, did you want to discuss this further?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=798)|
| 0:13:20| I'll discuss it briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=800)|
| 0:13:21| I've had several discussions, some with Mr. Jarrett and mainly with the sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=801)|
| 0:13:27| We had a constituent out in Dr. Briggs' area also that said an alarm went off for 40 hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=807)|
| 0:13:35| and the police came out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=815)|
| 0:13:37| Have you heard it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=817)|
| 0:13:38| Did you hear it, Jeff, too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=818)|
| 0:13:39| No, I hadn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=819)|
| 0:13:41| I mean, I heard about it, but I didn't know where.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=821)|
| 0:13:44| I mean, I think I read it in the paper maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=824)|
| 0:13:48| But that could happen, but obviously it shouldn't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=828)|
| 0:13:52| It would drive everybody crazy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=832)|
| 0:13:54| But there are things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=834)|
| 0:13:55| There are limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=835)|
| 0:13:57| You can have three a year without getting fined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=837)|
| 0:14:01| The Knox County Sheriff's Office or his designee is required to know how to cut the alarm off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=841)|
| 0:14:08| They should receive information about someone responsible for cutting a burglar alarm off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=848)|
| 0:14:13| I think this instance it was probably a home device that just was tied into the KUB system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=853)|
| 0:14:20| so it just went continuously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=860)|
| 0:14:22| There wasn't an ADT to call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=862)|
| 0:14:25| And there's, of course, provisions for something that is a false alarm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=865)|
| 0:14:30| but not holding the individual responsible, act of God, that being lightning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=870)|
| 0:14:34| or, of course, if somebody breaks in the house and it goes off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=874)|
| 0:14:37| But I'm confident or feel good about what the Sheriff's Office does in these situations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=877)|
| 0:14:42| and I just wanted to put it on the agenda to focus a little attention on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=882)|
| 0:14:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=886)|
| 0:14:48| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=888)|
| 0:14:51| Discussion regarding the Knox County Beer Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=891)|
| 0:14:53| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=893)|
| 0:14:54| We took care of that during the beer board meeting today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=894)|
| 0:14:58| Those are all of the discussion items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=898)|
| 0:15:00| We have a couple of items that will come up during zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=900)|
| 0:15:02| Is there any other business to come before commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=902)|
| 0:15:04| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=904)|
| 0:15:05| Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=905)|
| 0:15:07| Since we have a moment, the thing about the east sector plan being included in zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=907)|
| 0:15:15| maybe does not preclude us from sitting as full commission to have a discussion about a proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=915)|
| 0:15:21| that's being advanced by Ms. Gloria Ray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=921)|
| 0:15:24| Could we take a moment to see if she would want to give us a sentence or two about her proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=924)|
| 0:15:30| or is that out of order?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=930)|
| 0:15:33| Well, we were going to bring this up at our zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=933)|
| 0:15:38| The zoning issue to me is about the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=938)|
| 0:15:42| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=942)|
| 0:15:43| Yes, I mean if it's all right with commission, we'll be happy to discuss that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=943)|
| 0:15:45| You know, we could consider this part of the citizen forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=945)|
| 0:15:48| I'm talking about so we stay according to our protocols and all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=948)|
| 0:15:53| So why don't we just consider this citizen's forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=953)|
| 0:15:55| She gets five minutes and then questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=955)|
| 0:15:59| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=959)|
| 0:16:00| If we could, let me begin with Dean Rice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=960)|
| 0:16:02| Would you come to the podium, please, just so commissioners know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=962)|
| 0:16:05| I've had some conversation with Mayor Burchett and Mr. Rice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=965)|
| 0:16:08| and we thought the first step would be to have the luncheon today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=968)|
| 0:16:11| to have Mr. Donaldson come and speak with you about what our obligations are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=971)|
| 0:16:15| and Mr. Jarrett about where we need to move from this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=975)|
| 0:16:18| And I think they very correctly said that we could do nothing and let things stand as is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=978)|
| 0:16:23| or we could move ahead and look at some possible options for improvements to the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=983)|
| 0:16:29| And so in our discussions, we had thought, well, if it would be commission's desire to do nothing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=989)|
| 0:16:36| we of course could do that, but if there was a desire to move ahead,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=996)|
| 0:16:39| what would be the best procedure to do that or what would be a procedure to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=999)|
| 0:16:43| And so the mayor has advanced the notion of asking commission to allow him to appoint an ad hoc committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1003)|
| 0:16:49| to take a look at possible improvements to the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1009)|
| 0:16:55| possible uses of the Midway property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1015)|
| 0:16:59| and this would be an ad hoc committee that would include residents who live there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1019)|
| 0:17:03| it would include the development corporation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1023)|
| 0:17:05| it would include outside business interests that have no direct tie to this property whatsoever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1025)|
| 0:17:11| that could bring us a recommendation or recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1031)|
| 0:17:14| And so that was where we are, and Ms. Ray was involved in that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1034)|
| 0:17:18| but Mr. Rice, if you would begin with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1038)|
| 0:17:20| and then, Gloria, if you'd like to come down and speak as well, I'm sure they'll have questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1040)|
| 0:17:24| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1044)|
| 0:17:25| And on behalf of the mayor, that is in a nutshell what the discussion has been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1045)|
| 0:17:30| is to put together an ad hoc group of individuals across the spectrum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1050)|
| 0:17:34| those who were in favor of the previous zoning and those who were in favor of changing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1054)|
| 0:17:38| and to have a well-balanced committee that everyone has buy-in on to just simply look at potential uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1058)|
| 0:17:43| not looking at zoning, not stepping into the area of which you've been tasked to do as a body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1063)|
| 0:17:49| but to simply look at potential uses for that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1069)|
| 0:17:53| That would be satisfactory to all the parties involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1073)|
| 0:17:58| And to bring that back to commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1078)|
| 0:18:00| simply say these are some potential opportunities that may exist based on this citizen's committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1080)|
| 0:18:06| and then you do with them as you wish in terms of looking at what zoning overlays would need to be put into place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1086)|
| 0:18:12| But it would not be in any way the mayor saying this is what commission should do, A, B, or C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1092)|
| 0:18:18| It's simply saying here's a group of citizens that would like to have some input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1098)|
| 0:18:22| and Gloria has very graciously agreed to assist in that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1102)|
| 0:18:25| and I don't think there's anybody, very few in the county or much less in the state probably,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1105)|
| 0:18:31| who are better at bringing various parties together at the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1111)|
| 0:18:34| and talking through in a very positive, constructive manner than Gloria is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1114)|
| 0:18:40| Gloria, would you like to come forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1120)|
| 0:18:51| Gloria Ray, 4833 River Place Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1131)|
| 0:18:54| After those nice comments, I feel like I just should go back and sit down and say yay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1134)|
| 0:18:59| I am very pleased to have met with Chairman Hammond and also Mayor Burchett and Dean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1139)|
| 0:19:07| and have told him of my interest in doing whatever I could to help Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1147)|
| 0:19:13| by bringing some folks together and would love to have you all's endorsement as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1153)|
| 0:19:19| These are people that I think will be committed to the process of talking alternatives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1159)|
| 0:19:24| committed to the process of doing what will be best for Knox County now and in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1164)|
| 0:19:30| recognizing what's there now and what has been there and how they all fit together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1170)|
| 0:19:36| And I guess in a perfect world that we could live in perfect harmony| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1176)|
| 0:19:39| between the neighborhood and the business interest as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1179)|
| 0:19:44| So I'm being Pollyanna right now, but I really believe that we could do something good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1184)|
| 0:19:50| Can you tell us some of the people that you've contacted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1190)|
| 0:19:53| some of the people that might be possibles for this ad hoc committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1193)|
| 0:19:55| Again, it's an ad hoc committee. It's just for recommendation purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1195)|
| 0:19:59| Well, we have from the community that have confirmed three individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1199)|
| 0:20:05| and also three from the Development Corp and the Chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1205)|
| 0:20:09| And from the community, I feel comfortable naming those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1209)|
| 0:20:13| would be Elaine Clark, Vicki Baumgardner, and Pete Claussen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1213)|
| 0:20:21| From the Chamber Development Corp would be Mike Edwards, Rhonda Rice, and Todd Napier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1221)|
| 0:20:27| From the at-large group, shall we say, you're going to see representation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1227)|
| 0:20:31| from the folks that you all have talked about today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1231)|
| 0:20:34| the many assets that we have here from an educational standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1234)|
| 0:20:37| but we also have an advantage to have them involved in economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1237)|
| 0:20:41| From OR&L, from TVA, to the University of Tennessee, to some large manufacturing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1241)|
| 0:20:47| And I'm reluctant to name them by name because I have not talked to all of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1247)|
| 0:20:51| or have not gotten a response back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1251)|
| 0:20:54| Would they be interested if you all decide to move forward with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1254)|
| 0:20:57| because it's really in your court right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1257)|
| 0:21:00| But I can rest assured to you to say that it's going to be about eight individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1260)|
| 0:21:05| that are committed to, they have no agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1265)|
| 0:21:08| they have nothing but really the good of Knox County of wanting to be involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1268)|
| 0:21:13| Questions. Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1273)|
| 0:21:15| So just a general question about your body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1275)|
| 0:21:18| Are you all going to have open meetings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1278)|
| 0:21:23| We will. And we're probably only going to meet two or three times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1283)|
| 0:21:26| I mean, this is going to be more of something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1286)|
| 0:21:29| I had my sector plan 101 with Mr. Donaldson as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1289)|
| 0:21:34| And I got into section 101 and A and B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1294)|
| 0:21:38| I learned a lot more probably than I had planned to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1298)|
| 0:21:41| But I think when we get in that process and we see, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1301)|
| 0:21:45| what we're wanting to do is give some alternatives and options for you all to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1305)|
| 0:21:49| So we won't have the long meetings that you all certainly have had to have to deal with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1309)|
| 0:21:56| but we'll be more of a visioning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1316)|
| 0:21:58| Because in the last meeting when you all talked about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1318)|
| 0:22:01| I heard many of you say, well, what's the vision for that area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1321)|
| 0:22:04| What do you see for next year and 10 years from now and 20 years from now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1324)|
| 0:22:08| So we're going to have some folks that are going to talk in those rounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1328)|
| 0:22:12| And I will tell you, sustainability is a key issue that keeps coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1332)|
| 0:22:16| Okay. So there will be sunshine and all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1336)|
| 0:22:19| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1339)|
| 0:22:21| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1341)|
| 0:22:22| Thank you, Ms. Gloria, for stepping up to the plate again, as you always do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1342)|
| 0:22:27| I think this is a great idea, and I think it's just a point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1347)|
| 0:22:31| It's almost like a mediation board at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1351)|
| 0:22:34| And I think that's what's needed right now to give us some direction going forward in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1354)|
| 0:22:41| And if it takes a motion to direct this, to support this committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1361)|
| 0:22:46| and I think since it's an ad hoc committee, we can't tell them to do anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1366)|
| 0:22:51| but we could offer a motion of support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1371)|
| 0:22:56| I think that's what the mayor is looking for is just a motion of support so he can move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1376)|
| 0:22:59| I'll also move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1379)|
| 0:23:01| Do we need to suspend the rules?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1381)|
| 0:23:03| No, this is just an express will of the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1383)|
| 0:23:05| This is just an express will of the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1385)|
| 0:23:06| So is there any opposition to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1386)|
| 0:23:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1388)|
| 0:23:09| We're unanimous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1389)|
| 0:23:10| So, Ms. Gloria, you go for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1390)|
| 0:23:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1392)|
| 0:23:13| We'll do our best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1393)|
| 0:23:14| And, Mr. Rice, would you express to the mayor our appreciation for his stepping up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1394)|
| 0:23:17| and willing to appoint this committee and for his work, and we look forward to seeing the results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1397)|
| 0:23:21| Again, these are recommendations, but having citizens and having people talking together is a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1401)|
| 0:23:26| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1406)|
| 0:23:28| Is there any other business to come before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1408)|
| 0:23:31| Yes, Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1411)|
| 0:23:33| I didn't know whether we wanted to go ahead and talk about times now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1413)|
| 0:23:36| and discuss that for the hillside thing, or you want to wait until 6?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1416)|
| 0:23:41| I mean, it makes no difference to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1421)|
| 0:23:43| You mean setting up a workshop calendar?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1423)|
| 0:23:44| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1424)|
| 0:23:45| We had talked about a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1425)|
| 0:23:46| We'll go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1426)|
| 0:23:47| I'll just throw out an idea, and that was when we have our work session in February,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1427)|
| 0:23:51| either meeting before or after so we're all here and just having it with a normal meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1431)|
| 0:23:57| So if we wanted to meet at noon, we could do a lunch deal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1437)|
| 0:24:00| or if we wanted to do it afterwards and meet at 4, say around 4 o'clock, then we could do it afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1440)|
| 0:24:05| But I was just thinking in terms of combining those two since we're already here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1445)|
| 0:24:09| That's just an idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1449)|
| 0:24:13| Can I voice the after?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1453)|
| 0:24:17| Do after, so 4 o'clock?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1457)|
| 0:24:18| My opinion is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1458)|
| 0:24:19| You know, it's good because we would have zonings at 6 and that would force us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1459)|
| 0:24:25| This would be for our workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1465)|
| 0:24:26| That's what I mean, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1466)|
| 0:24:27| But what I mean, though, is that that would force us to stop at 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1467)|
| 0:24:30| That would have a two-hour period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1470)|
| 0:24:34| But you're talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1474)|
| 0:24:35| We're talking about a workshop, not a regular meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1475)|
| 0:24:37| We're not talking about the regular meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1477)|
| 0:24:39| We're talking the week before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1479)|
| 0:24:42| The week before we have our workshop session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1482)|
| 0:24:45| Oh, I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1485)|
| 0:24:46| So we do it right after the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1486)|
| 0:24:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1488)|
| 0:24:49| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1489)|
| 0:24:50| Because we might vote on it the next week, so this would give us a chance if indeed we do decide to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1490)|
| 0:24:54| Commissioner Norman, is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1494)|
| 0:24:56| Yeah, that would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1496)|
| 0:24:58| I also wanted to add that most of you all picked up the hard copy of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1498)|
| 0:25:04| It was in your box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1504)|
| 0:25:05| There were a few of them that were still up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1505)|
| 0:25:07| So you've got a copy of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1507)|
| 0:25:09| And there will probably be, and I think there's already been, a bit of an onslaught of emails of issues that are fairly inflammatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1509)|
| 0:25:18| We've been doing this a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1518)|
| 0:25:21| None of those issues are new, and we've taken them all up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1521)|
| 0:25:24| And so we'll get into those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1524)|
| 0:25:26| I think they'll be just as with MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1526)|
| 0:25:30| I think we started out with about nine of them fairly questioning, and in the end it was a 12-2 vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1530)|
| 0:25:38| So don't be alarmed by the things that you see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1538)|
| 0:25:41| I think those are fairly special interest driven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1541)|
| 0:25:45| And I think also we'll have something in writing that probably addresses those in a pointed way within a day or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1545)|
| 0:25:54| And we'll stick those in your box and have those in writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1554)|
| 0:25:57| So, Joel, if you would make note that after our work session in February at 4 o'clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1557)|
| 0:26:02| or following our work session, we will have the forum on hillside and slope protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1562)|
| 0:26:09| Commissioner Rawls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1569)|
| 0:26:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1571)|
| 0:26:12| Two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1572)|
| 0:26:13| Who all is planning to go to the NACo legislative conference in March?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1573)|
| 0:26:19| Do we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1579)|
| 0:26:20| Is this in Washington?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1580)|
| 0:26:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1581)|
| 0:26:22| Who all is planning to attend that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1582)|
| 0:26:23| I'm going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1583)|
| 0:26:24| So just the three of us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1584)|
| 0:26:26| I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1586)|
| 0:26:27| And Sam might.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1587)|
| 0:26:29| I'd like to encourage the rest of you to go if at all possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1589)|
| 0:26:34| It's amazing how much you learn at one of these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1594)|
| 0:26:37| It really is beneficial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1597)|
| 0:26:40| And also was hoping that maybe those of us who are going could get together beforehand to kind of map out what's going to happen while we're there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1600)|
| 0:26:48| make sure that we don't all wind up going to the same things so that we can all bring back something different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1608)|
| 0:26:54| And also I was wondering, was anybody interested in going to get a bite to eat right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1614)|
| 0:27:05| Or would anyone like any liquid refreshment right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1625)|
| 0:27:08| We may need one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1628)|
| 0:27:09| I'm just kidding, folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1629)|
| 0:27:11| I don't drink, but I'm thinking about taking it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1631)|
| 0:27:14| Any other items of business to come before the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1634)|
| 0:27:17| If not, we are adjourned until 6 o'clock when we will take up zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1637)|
| 0:27:32| That means it's time for our zoning portion of our wildly popular meeting today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1652)|
| 0:27:37| So, clerk, if you would call the roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1657)|
| 0:27:40| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1660)|

| 0:27:57| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1677)|
| 0:27:58| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1678)|
| 0:27:59| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1679)|
| 0:28:00| Commissioner Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1680)|
| 0:28:01| We have 10 of the 11 commissioners present, so we have more than enough for a quorum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1681)|
| 0:28:02| Let me say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1682)|
| 0:28:03| I know that there are some of you here on the Hilltop and Ridgetop Protection Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1683)|
| 0:28:07| We have decided that we will have a work session on our work session day at 4 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1687)|
| 0:28:14| So, Jolie, what day is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1694)|
| 0:28:15| Is there a holiday in there that we meet on a Tuesday instead of a Monday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1695)|
| 0:28:18| It's the 22nd and the 28th of our meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1698)|
| 0:28:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1705)|
| 0:28:26| So, on the 22nd, we have our work session at 2 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1706)|
| 0:28:31| At 4 o'clock or right after the meeting, we will have a hearing on the Hilltop and Ridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1711)|
| 0:28:38| Protection Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1718)|
| 0:28:39| So, anyone that wants to address commission with regards to that issue, that will be the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1719)|
| 0:28:42| time to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1722)|
| 0:28:43| So, we want to make sure that we have properly noticed on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1723)|
| 0:28:46| Also, Commissioner Wright, I've been asked to talk about the sector plan, and I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1726)|
| 0:28:51| that you had wanted to do that, so we will do that as well as soon as we get through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1731)|
| 0:28:55| with zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1735)|
| 0:28:56| Is that okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1736)|
| 0:28:57| So, let's go into the zoning part of our program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1737)|
| 0:28:59| So, Clerk, if you would read the first one, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1739)|

| 0:31:52| Make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1912)|

| 0:32:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1944)|
| 0:32:25| Can I have a point of order?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1945)|
| 0:32:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1946)|
| 0:32:27| Mr. Donaldson, this is the third showing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1947)|
| 0:32:29| What's the normal course of action there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1949)|
| 0:32:33| I would recommend that you deny the rezoning request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1953)|
| 0:32:38| We have made repeated attempts to get them to come to the meetings, and they have not shown up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1958)|

| 0:32:47| Well, what I wanted to do was to we have, I believe, the same thing on the next one, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1967)|
| 0:32:53| And I was going to have the discussion that you just had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1973)|
| 0:32:55| I amend my motion to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=1975)|

| 0:33:29| Move to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2009)|

| 0:33:57| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2037)|
| 0:33:58| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2038)|
| 0:33:59| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2039)|
| 0:34:00| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2040)|
| 0:34:01| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2041)|
| 0:34:02| Any questions, comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2042)|
| 0:34:03| Mr. Donaldson, does this cure the issue that we had with pool permits that the law department said we can't give?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2043)|
| 0:34:14| This will partially address that because it deals with accessory structures in those big side yards that were required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2054)|
| 0:34:22| But there's another amendment in the process that you referred back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2062)|
| 0:34:27| It will be coming forward to you soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2067)|
| 0:34:30| It also addresses swimming pools in planned residential districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2070)|
| 0:34:33| Can we get that fast-tracked?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2073)|
| 0:34:35| Because it's getting to be permit season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2075)|
| 0:34:39| It's been through the Planning Commission, so it will be out in your next month's agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2079)|
| 0:34:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2084)|
| 0:34:48| So we have a motion and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2088)|
| 0:34:50| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2090)|
| 0:34:51| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2091)|
| 0:34:52| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2092)|
| 0:34:53| It has passed on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2093)|
| 0:34:55| That's all the business that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2095)|
| 0:34:57| And now let's move to Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2097)|
| 0:34:59| You had asked that we talk about the sector plan, and so you're recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2099)|
| 0:35:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2102)|
| 0:35:03| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2103)|
| 0:35:05| As we have had school of instruction today on the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2105)|
| 0:35:10| and how sector plans find their way between MPC and commission from the planning body to the legislative body back and forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2110)|
| 0:35:21| I believe one of the things that was recommended on the east county sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2121)|
| 0:35:29| since we've had three years of input and we only have 1% of the property in dispute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2129)|
| 0:35:36| and since the plan as presented was denied, that we, county commission, send forward a plan to be reviewed by MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2136)|
| 0:35:55| and ultimately returned to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2155)|
| 0:35:58| I would submit that the plan that we need to send to MPC mirror their plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2158)|
| 0:36:06| with the exception of the piece of property referred to as the development core midway road business park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2166)|
| 0:36:15| And this is just a discussion item, but if we pursue that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2175)|
| 0:36:23| then I'd like to see the law director prepare something for next month's agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2183)|
| 0:36:32| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2192)|
| 0:36:33| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2193)|
| 0:36:35| I guess my only apprehension about doing that at this time is that we just kind of gave our blessings to an entity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2195)|
| 0:36:44| that's going to, you know, take another look at that and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2204)|
| 0:36:49| coming from all different sides, government, private, plus the development folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2209)|
| 0:36:53| and come up with some changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2213)|
| 0:36:56| I'd just like to kind of hear what they have to say before we go and strike it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2216)|
| 0:37:01| and then have to do something else with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2221)|
| 0:37:03| Like Mr. Donaldson said, we can let it sit for a while,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2223)|
| 0:37:08| but I would hate to pass something that we have to go back and make another sector plan change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2228)|
| 0:37:14| without getting all the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2234)|
| 0:37:16| That's my only concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2236)|
| 0:37:18| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2238)|
| 0:37:22| Yes, when we were talking earlier today, I was under the impression that word had been circulating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2242)|
| 0:37:32| about this ad hoc committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2252)|
| 0:37:34| and apparently there are some people who have been very, very involved in this issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2254)|
| 0:37:41| and feel like this has sort of come up out of the blue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2261)|
| 0:37:46| And so I would actually, even though we have essentially given our blessing to this committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2266)|
| 0:37:53| or to the mayor to form this committee, I would, and I'll give Gloria Ray a call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2273)|
| 0:37:59| would like to know who is doing the selecting to be on the committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2279)|
| 0:38:05| and would like to make sure that the community feels like it's being adequately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2285)|
| 0:38:13| or getting enough representation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2293)|
| 0:38:16| And I think there were maybe a couple people here who wanted to speak on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2296)|
| 0:38:23| Sure, let me say that the mayor will be appointing the committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2303)|
| 0:38:27| and so anyone who would want to serve on the committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2307)|
| 0:38:30| I'm certain that Mayor Burchett would be happy to talk with them and discuss this with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2310)|
| 0:38:34| But this will be the mayor's committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2314)|
| 0:38:36| It will be his selection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2316)|
| 0:38:38| We'll get you in just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2318)|
| 0:38:40| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2320)|
| 0:38:41| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2321)|
| 0:38:42| I agree with Sam that maybe what we ought to do is wait and see what comes out of this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2322)|
| 0:38:49| And I'll be honest, I really am waiting to look at this with an open mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2329)|
| 0:38:55| And, for instance, if we approve the sector plan, you know, per the present MPC recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2335)|
| 0:39:03| and just leave that one percent out, which is the property that's owned by the development corporation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2343)|
| 0:39:09| we may be hobbling a really good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2349)|
| 0:39:12| And let me explain what I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2352)|
| 0:39:14| I believe that much of that intersection is already zoned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2354)|
| 0:39:20| And that was part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2360)|
| 0:39:22| That commercial part would go away, and then they would be able to develop a business part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2362)|
| 0:39:25| But if, let's say somebody comes up with a really good idea for something that may be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2365)|
| 0:39:31| I don't know what zoning classification this would be, some sort of recreational zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2371)|
| 0:39:36| or some sort of zoning that would be agro-tourism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2376)|
| 0:39:39| I'm just trying to think of something that we may not want to leave that zone commercial right there at that intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2379)|
| 0:39:47| One of the things that I agreed with many of the people out there on is that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2387)|
| 0:39:53| I don't like the way that a lot of our interstate intersections look just with Kentucky Fried Chickens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2393)|
| 0:39:57| and Motel 6s and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2397)|
| 0:40:00| But if somebody came up with a good idea, I don't want to go ahead and have that zoning in place at the intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2400)|
| 0:40:06| when we may have something that's a better idea that's going to come out of this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2406)|
| 0:40:11| And so I really agree with Commissioner McKenzie is that what let's do, let's see what ideas people have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2411)|
| 0:40:18| and then maybe do sort of a regional sector plan around, you know, what may come out of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2418)|
| 0:40:26| if there's really a good idea rather than saying we're going to keep commercial zoning there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2426)|
| 0:40:29| we're going to keep everything else and not just look at this midway piece of property in isolation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2429)|
| 0:40:37| I think if somebody does come up with a good idea, we may want to have a different zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2437)|
| 0:40:41| even in the areas surrounding that property, particularly along the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2441)|
| 0:40:45| And that's the only comment I would make about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2445)|
| 0:40:48| We'll continue with Commissioner's discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2448)|
| 0:40:50| But if you would give us your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2450)|
| 0:40:52| I'm Robert Wolfenbarger, 8416 Kodak Road, 37914.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2452)|
| 0:40:58| As many of you know me already, I'm the primary spokesperson for the people that are involved in this issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2458)|
| 0:41:06| and have been for the past 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2466)|
| 0:41:08| And as you know, I was here earlier this afternoon in your workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2468)|
| 0:41:14| and sat for probably 20 minutes or so into the initiation of the county commission meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2474)|
| 0:41:21| and weren't at that point not aware of anything to do with any ad hoc committee that was going to be formed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2481)|
| 0:41:28| That's discouraging in its own right, and it should be to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2488)|
| 0:41:34| Since I've communicated with all of you, and you probably are aware of my relationship with the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2494)|
| 0:41:40| With regard to that, we in the community were confident that the county commission would follow through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2500)|
| 0:41:49| on what we perceived to be the spirit of the denial of the East County Sector Plan last month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2509)|
| 0:41:56| and follow through with an approval of the sector plan, as we've discussed already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2516)|
| 0:42:03| the proposed sector plan for 2011 or 2010,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2523)|
| 0:42:08| and incorporate the existing zonings that are in the 2000 sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2528)|
| 0:42:14| And as we all know, the owners of the other property that we're talking about retaining the current zoning on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2534)|
| 0:42:24| which is a combination of planned residential, agricultural, and some office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2544)|
| 0:42:31| the current owners of that property, which happens to be the development corporation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2551)|
| 0:42:34| could come back and ask for a rezoning in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2554)|
| 0:42:38| Now, what I'm hearing now sounds like some kind of redo of the sector planning process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2558)|
| 0:42:44| as opposed to following through on the sentiment that the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2564)|
| 0:42:48| And as a matter of fact, Mike Brown suggested this afternoon we were comfortable with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2568)|
| 0:42:56| and in full agreement on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2576)|
| 0:42:58| As far as this ad hoc committee, we're not necessarily opposed to ad hoc committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2578)|
| 0:43:02| but I think that we should have known about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2582)|
| 0:43:10| It just sounds like, you know, something that we've experienced before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2590)|
| 0:43:17| And I'm expressing that concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2597)|
| 0:43:19| I'm hoping that you're hearing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2599)|
| 0:43:23| Commissioner Brown's suggestion this afternoon was the direction that we thought we were going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2603)|
| 0:43:29| If we're going to address this property again in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2609)|
| 0:43:31| it can be addressed through the rezoning process after the sector plan is adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2611)|
| 0:43:37| And as far as an ad hoc committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2617)|
| 0:43:40| I'd feel privileged to continue to participate on an ad hoc committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2620)|
| 0:43:45| and address the potential use of this property in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2625)|
| 0:43:50| but that can be addressed in a rezoning process, which you all do every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2630)|
| 0:43:54| There's no need to hold up this sector plan adoption, or in this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2634)|
| 0:44:02| referral back to MPC so that it can ultimately come back to the commission for adoption| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2642)|
| 0:44:06| to wait and see, because that's a redo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2646)|
| 0:44:10| That's not an adoption or it's not in the sentiment of where we were traveling last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2650)|
| 0:44:18| And if I'm missing something, please ask me a question and I'll try to address it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2658)|
| 0:44:21| or at least rethink my thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2661)|
| 0:44:23| But I don't know that there's any kind of commissioner sitting here tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2663)|
| 0:44:27| that knew this was the direction we were going to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2667)|
| 0:44:34| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2674)|
| 0:44:37| First of all, I want to, in regards to Commissioner Wrights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2677)|
| 0:44:41| and Commissioner McKenzie, Commissioner Briggs, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2681)|
| 0:44:44| I think we should wait before we, and there's a bigger reason that we should wait| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2684)|
| 0:44:51| is after the ad hoc committee comes together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2691)|
| 0:44:53| To me, if we do what Mr. Wolfenbarger said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2693)|
| 0:44:56| we just implemented the minus the Midway Road area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2696)|
| 0:45:01| we would have to go before MPC with a sector plan change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2701)|
| 0:45:04| which gets into more legal stuff that we don't want to get into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2704)|
| 0:45:07| And if we can, you know, to recommend a sector amendment change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2707)|
| 0:45:11| we've got to show a change and we've got to meet some of the criteria that we discussed today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2711)|
| 0:45:15| And I think it's easier for us to breathe a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2715)|
| 0:45:20| and to see if there's another use for that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2720)|
| 0:45:25| Because there's another part of the sector plan that I don't know that we've, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2725)|
| 0:45:29| the Seven Islands, and I'm terrible with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2729)|
| 0:45:33| the Seven Islands where they're wanting to put this land in conservatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2733)|
| 0:45:37| I want to make sure that all the owners of that property are on board with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2737)|
| 0:45:42| Because they're talking hundreds of acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2742)|
| 0:45:44| And if all the property owners aren't on board with that, I can't vote for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2744)|
| 0:45:47| And so I think we need to re-look at the whole sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2747)|
| 0:45:52| It wasn't just the Midway Road for me, it was the, am I saying it right, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2752)|
| 0:45:56| Am I saying it correctly, Commissioner Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2756)|
| 0:45:59| Putting the land, Elaine, or could you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2759)|
| 0:46:03| The corridor, the preservation of the corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2763)|
| 0:46:06| And I'm not against that, but I want all the property owners to be notified and sign off on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2766)|
| 0:46:10| And so I want to make sure that those things are done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2770)|
| 0:46:12| It's not just the Midway Road project for me, it's talking about the corridor also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2772)|
| 0:46:17| So I think we need to revisit the whole plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2777)|
| 0:46:20| And, you know, it was plain in our vote last month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2780)|
| 0:46:25| Mr. Donaldson, he plainly said, if we vote it down, then we have to come back to them with a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2785)|
| 0:46:34| Now, that plan could be just everything minus the Midway Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2794)|
| 0:46:38| but that wasn't the only issue that I had with the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2798)|
| 0:46:41| So I think we need to heed the advice of Commissioner McKenzie and Briggs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2801)|
| 0:46:47| and just kind of wait and see how the ad hoc committee does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2807)|
| 0:46:51| I have confidence that Gloria Ray can put together the right people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2811)|
| 0:46:55| and we may find something that's much better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2815)|
| 0:46:59| So that's my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2819)|
| 0:47:01| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2821)|
| 0:47:02| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2822)|
| 0:47:05| So many points have been brought up just in 15 or 20 seconds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2825)|
| 0:47:11| that have been thoroughly and in depth discussed for the last three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2831)|
| 0:47:20| A couple of months ago, whenever we voted on the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2840)|
| 0:47:25| the only thing that we had any disagreement over was the 1%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2845)|
| 0:47:32| just one particular field of use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2852)|
| 0:47:39| There are lots of other things that are in the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2859)|
| 0:47:41| like the 1,000-foot overlay of commercial on Asheville Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2861)|
| 0:47:47| which is a good thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2867)|
| 0:47:50| or moving certain query sites, which may be agricultural right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2870)|
| 0:47:56| into industrial is related to the Forks of the River.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2876)|
| 0:48:01| People in Carter seem to look at an overlay of a town center in Carter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2881)|
| 0:48:07| as something that, you know, they had to work their way through it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2887)|
| 0:48:10| but they've done that over the last, and there again, I have to say, three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2890)|
| 0:48:16| Mixed use, just across the river bridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2896)|
| 0:48:20| north of the intersection of Asheville Highway and John Spear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2900)|
| 0:48:25| two or three hundred acres that could have a new and different kind of use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2905)|
| 0:48:32| mixed use I think it's referred to, residential and commercial in the same area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2912)|
| 0:48:38| something that we don't really look at most of the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2918)|
| 0:48:46| It's difficult for me to say do this, don't do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2926)|
| 0:48:50| but the idea that, as the people standing in the podium are presenting to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2930)|
| 0:48:58| that we haven't studied it long and hard enough,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2938)|
| 0:49:01| and we need to maybe move on down the road just a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2941)|
| 0:49:07| and accept the sector plan as we've been working on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2947)|
| 0:49:10| and if there is, it doesn't make any difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2950)|
| 0:49:13| If we don't act, we're going to act in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2953)|
| 0:49:15| If we act now, we can still act in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2955)|
| 0:49:18| I believe that the ad hoc committee, we're already seeing questions raised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2958)|
| 0:49:25| about who's going to be on it and how long is it going to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2965)|
| 0:49:28| and what can be done with it, with the ad hoc committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2968)|
| 0:49:34| I am going to press for we need to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2974)|
| 0:49:37| That was the position that commission by majority took a couple of months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2977)|
| 0:49:43| It's the position that I still maintain right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2983)|
| 0:49:46| and it's also the position that we got out of land use 101 at lunchtime today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2986)|
| 0:49:55| We need to take action, and at the end of this discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=2995)|
| 0:50:01| what I'm asking is for the law director to present, prepare resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3001)|
| 0:50:07| that does 99% of what the last three years' study has brought together into a plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3007)|
| 0:50:14| and we leave this particular one piece of property like it is in the past plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3014)|
| 0:50:22| I believe that's sort of the advice we got from MPC today, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3022)|
| 0:50:26| We've studied it about that long, haven't we, Mark?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3026)|
| 0:50:30| It has been that long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3030)|
| 0:50:33| We would like to see the 99% approved at some point in the very near future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3033)|
| 0:50:38| and whether that's next month or two months down the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3038)|
| 0:50:40| or four or five months down the road, we just don't want to get lost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3040)|
| 0:50:44| and have East County Sector Plan move to the back of the line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3044)|
| 0:50:48| and wait until the 11 other sectors have received an update before we get back to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3048)|
| 0:50:54| So I appreciate Metropolitan Planning Commission's taking a position in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3054)|
| 0:51:02| As the discussion has evolved and developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3062)|
| 0:51:06| the thing that I thought we had out of the way last couple of months ago with a vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3066)|
| 0:51:13| needs to be made operational so that the validity of that data on Asheville Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3073)|
| 0:51:22| or John Sevier or Forks of the River,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3082)|
| 0:51:25| all of that data be incorporated into the plan made operational.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3085)|
| 0:51:29| The citizens of the 8th District or in that particular sector of the 8th District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3089)|
| 0:51:35| can then begin to make plans for their future based on how the lay of the land is going to be out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3095)|
| 0:51:42| We're just leaving out for discussion the development corporation's piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3102)|
| 0:51:49| at the Midway Road interchange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3109)|
| 0:51:51| And I'd like for us to take a moment and look back to recent activity that we've had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3111)|
| 0:51:58| sitting as the zoning commission or the zoning board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3118)|
| 0:52:02| Fox Road Marina or Fox Road Restaurant, we took it, we discussed it, we voted on it, and it's gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3122)|
| 0:52:12| What are our concerns for that property owner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3132)|
| 0:52:16| I don't know that we have any particular concern for that property owner before us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3136)|
| 0:52:22| At the end of Roberts Road on Rutledge Pike, we had a few months ago a request by the dollar store for some rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3142)|
| 0:52:30| I don't think it went exactly as I'd like to have seen it go, but we took action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3150)|
| 0:52:37| We voted, and today we don't really care about what the dollar store thinks about what we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3157)|
| 0:52:43| Now, maybe they'll come back, maybe they'll go to court, maybe they're happy with what they received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3163)|
| 0:52:48| But to think that we're today discussing something on behalf of that property owner, I don't think we're going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3168)|
| 0:52:55| And I think the same thing is true of the development corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3175)|
| 0:52:59| They're a property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3179)|
| 0:53:01| We've taken a position, we've voted, and we need to move on with, as state law says, what's the next step?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3181)|
| 0:53:13| We have to formulate a plan, send it to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3193)|
| 0:53:16| They're going to send it back to us approved, not approved, or no position taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3196)|
| 0:53:23| But we've got thousands of acres that need to have some plan implemented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3203)|
| 0:53:29| and made operational on the basis of this three years of study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3209)|
| 0:53:33| And, Mr. Law Director, I'm asking you to prepare something for us for the next agenda to be taken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3213)|
| 0:53:43| for action to be taken in relationship to this sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3223)|
| 0:53:50| Mr. Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3230)|
| 0:53:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3232)|
| 0:53:54| Does that need to be in the form of a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3234)|
| 0:53:57| That's just a request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3237)|
| 0:53:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3239)|
| 0:54:00| I didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3240)|
| 0:54:01| All I wanted to say was just give Mr. Wolfenbarger and Ms. Starbuck a little bit of the background, I guess, related to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3241)|
| 0:54:12| I mean, as soon as the vote was taken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3252)|
| 0:54:15| I think it was a clear, because of the strength of the vote to deny the Midway Business Park by this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3255)|
| 0:54:25| it's clear the sentiment of the body is to take that property out of the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3265)|
| 0:54:34| I think it was clearly our intent, the body, speaking of the body, to have that 99% of the sector plan approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3274)|
| 0:54:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3285)|
| 0:54:46| To me, clearly, the owners of the property have been told, we don't want a business park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3286)|
| 0:54:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3294)|
| 0:54:55| This is not an effort to circumvent that statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3295)|
| 0:55:01| To me, as soon as the vote was taken, and I think Ms. Ray had anticipated this for a number of days or weeks or months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3301)|
| 0:55:12| and she had germinated an idea for some alternatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3312)|
| 0:55:17| And so she comes today, and I think she's specifically talking about those formulating ideas for that portion of the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3317)|
| 0:55:31| the Midway term, the Midway Business Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3331)|
| 0:55:34| That's where it is, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3334)|
| 0:55:37| And so, you know, I know that Bob's put, you guys have put so much effort into this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3337)|
| 0:55:45| and you don't want to see something come in the back door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3345)|
| 0:55:50| And I think there's a whole lot of other people that feel that way too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3350)|
| 0:55:56| Mr. Burrells.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3356)|
| 0:55:59| I just wanted to say that I completely support Commissioner Wright on this, that we need to move forward and approve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3359)|
| 0:56:09| The people in this community deserve to have some peace on this issue at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3369)|
| 0:56:15| and if changes need to be made down the road, we can certainly make them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3375)|
| 0:56:22| Let me also say that the mayor does not need our approval to form an ad hoc committee to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3382)|
| 0:56:30| He can do it totally on his own, but Mr. Rice came and said the mayor would like your blessing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3390)|
| 0:56:36| And he said, we would just like for you to know that this is what we would like to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3396)|
| 0:56:39| We'd like your blessing, and the mayor will appoint the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3399)|
| 0:56:42| We were unanimous in giving them the blessing to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3402)|
| 0:56:45| So I assume that we're still unanimous in doing that, to let him go ahead and form his committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3405)|
| 0:56:51| This is the mayor's committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3411)|
| 0:56:54| And so I think that that's still a good plan to have them look at the Midway Business Park, bring it up next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3414)|
| 0:57:00| I think it's entirely proper to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3420)|
| 0:57:02| And so the law director will work on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3422)|
| 0:57:04| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3424)|
| 0:57:05| You know, I guess I really have a question just about the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3425)|
| 0:57:09| because we talked today during our chairman's luncheon that we want to avoid spot zoning and changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3429)|
| 0:57:17| You said if we want to go back and do something, we can just rezone it or resector it or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3437)|
| 0:57:23| But if we go ahead and pass this, is there any reason for the mayor to even have this ad hoc committee if we're going to do what we're going to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3443)|
| 0:57:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3449)|
| 0:57:31| Because of the Midway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3451)|
| 0:57:32| If the Midway is taken out, the 380 acres, then yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3452)|
| 0:57:37| But can we approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3457)|
| 0:57:39| I have a question, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3459)|
| 0:57:40| I thought that what we couldn't do, because we tried to do this once before, is that we couldn't pull Midway out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3460)|
| 0:57:46| We either had to approve the sector plan with Midway in it or, you know, we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3466)|
| 0:57:52| I mean, I guess I'm really asking more about the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3472)|
| 0:57:55| I'm not making a comment on what I agree with or disagree with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3475)|
| 0:57:58| I'm just trying to understand the process better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3478)|
| 0:58:02| Well, I'm just wondering, your proposal to the law director is to do 99 percent and leave out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3482)|
| 0:58:07| Was that what you were saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3487)|
| 0:58:09| Or are you saying the whole thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3489)|
| 0:58:11| As we had in school today, the planning authority, on like a six- or seven- or eight-year rotating basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3491)|
| 0:58:23| goes from sector to sector to sector, revisiting what may have changed in those sectors since the last plan was implemented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3503)|
| 0:58:34| And there are 12 sectors, six of them primarily city and six of them primarily county, but only one that is entirely 100 percent city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3514)|
| 0:58:45| See, I paid attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3525)|
| 0:58:50| They presented their after-exhaustive study plan for the East County sector, the new sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3530)|
| 0:59:04| with all of its amendments and whatever's added and whatever and whatever and whatever, and we said no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3544)|
| 0:59:11| And the only reason we said no, majority vote of county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3551)|
| 0:59:16| is because of this one percent of the East County sector plan by majority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3556)|
| 0:59:24| we disagreed with its new usage or zoning or whatever you want to refer to that as.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3564)|
| 0:59:32| All we could do is say yes or no, approve or deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3572)|
| 0:59:37| And we denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3577)|
| 0:59:38| And it's back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3578)|
| 0:59:41| And there it can lay until the French broad freezes over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3581)|
| 0:59:47| The next step, though, is for the legislative body, us, to present our own plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3587)|
| 0:59:57| And I am thoroughly enamored with and in love with the plan that's presented by MPC along with the majority of commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3597)|
| 1:00:09| except for that one percent or that less than 400 acres or whatever it is we want to call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3609)|
| 1:00:14| And we can find a technical name to call it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3614)|
| 1:00:16| It's the Midway Road location that is owned by the Development Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3616)|
| 1:00:22| And what I would like to see happen is that the plan be made operational as presented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3622)|
| 1:00:31| with the exception of that piece of property which will remain as it is currently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3631)|
| 1:00:38| is zoned a good word, currently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3638)|
| 1:00:42| Designated as a land use classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3642)|
| 1:00:46| Leave it as currently designated land use classification for that one particular piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3646)|
| 1:00:53| And then the sector plan is away from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3653)|
| 1:00:58| It allows all the people to take all those particular parts of the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3658)|
| 1:01:02| and go implement them in all those other hundreds of thousands, well, maybe not hundreds of thousands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3662)|
| 1:01:06| but all the other acres of the East County sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3666)|
| 1:01:11| But what's still on our plate, what is still before us, is what will ultimately happen to that piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3671)|
| 1:01:18| And it will be years down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3678)|
| 1:01:21| So there's no need for us to throw out all of this planning and go years down the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3681)|
| 1:01:29| when we're just talking about this one particular land, piece of land, and its usage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3689)|
| 1:01:36| I believe that we do have the right capability, power, and I shouldn't use that word,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3696)|
| 1:01:44| to address that piece of property at any point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3704)|
| 1:01:49| And when there is a majority of commission, like whatever land usage is presented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3709)|
| 1:01:54| it can be made operational, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3714)|
| 1:01:57| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3717)|
| 1:01:58| The legislative body has the authority to initiate a plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3718)|
| 1:02:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3722)|
| 1:02:03| But that's months, if not years, down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3723)|
| 1:02:06| So let's get on with, at the next meeting, making operational, as we've discussed for years now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3726)|
| 1:02:15| the land usage in the East sector plan based on the current data and information that's before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3735)|
| 1:02:23| The MPC plan minus this one particular parcel, which will retain its existing land usage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3743)|
| 1:02:33| I want to make sure I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3753)|
| 1:02:35| So the mayor's ad hoc committee could still look at this acreage and come back with a recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3755)|
| 1:02:46| and it could be implemented down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3766)|
| 1:02:50| So in other words, I don't want citizens to come in and spend an awful lot of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3770)|
| 1:02:54| and find out that we've just wasted their time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3774)|
| 1:02:56| I've been on these committees and I know what it's like to have your time wasted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3776)|
| 1:03:00| and have your stuff put up on a shelf and nobody pay attention to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3780)|
| 1:03:03| I don't want that to happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3783)|
| 1:03:04| So if they're not going to be able to do productive work, then let's put the brakes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3784)|
| 1:03:08| But I just want to make sure that if indeed this committee can do some productive work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3788)|
| 1:03:13| and come to us with recommendations that will be seriously considered, then I'm all for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3793)|
| 1:03:18| So I just want to make sure from our MPC folks that that can indeed happen, and I guess our law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3798)|
| 1:03:24| That can in fact happen and it would be very comparable to many of the small area plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3804)|
| 1:03:30| that we do within the city on a neighborhood-by-neighborhood basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3810)|
| 1:03:34| where those plans are ultimately adopted as part of the sector plan when they're completed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3814)|
| 1:03:40| and they go through the city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3820)|
| 1:03:42| Okay. Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3822)|
| 1:03:45| I just wanted to say that our perspective has always been that Midway Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3825)|
| 1:03:53| or excuse me, I think it's ECO-7, Commissioner Wright,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3833)|
| 1:03:58| in the 2010 sector plan as it's designated for that site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3838)|
| 1:04:03| has always been that that property remain as it is currently zoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3843)|
| 1:04:13| in current land use designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3853)|
| 1:04:16| As with any zoning in the future or rezoning in the future, which this commission does monthly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3856)|
| 1:04:24| it can be addressed based on the information available at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3864)|
| 1:04:31| As we know currently, the Development Corporation has proposed a business park there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3871)|
| 1:04:38| which this commission has, as Commissioner Norman made very clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3878)|
| 1:04:43| the majority has said that they don't want to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3883)|
| 1:04:48| From the community's perspective, we understand, based on the discussions that we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3888)|
| 1:04:54| some time a couple of months ago with the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3894)|
| 1:04:56| that there has to be some alternative use for this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3896)|
| 1:05:01| now that the Development Corporation owns it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3901)|
| 1:05:04| We respect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3904)|
| 1:05:06| We respect it so well that we spent our time and money and effort to come up with an alternative plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3906)|
| 1:05:15| I want to remind the commission that the community feels like that we can recover the investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3915)|
| 1:05:21| that the Development Corporation has made there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3921)|
| 1:05:24| And if it is the sentiment of this commission that there's not going to be a business park there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3924)|
| 1:05:30| Noss County may not want to own this land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3930)|
| 1:05:33| If Noss County can recover the $10 million that's invested there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3933)|
| 1:05:37| and maybe even recover the $17 million that's in the bank waiting to be spent there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3937)|
| 1:05:42| for the first phase of development out of three phases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3942)|
| 1:05:46| the first phase, I want to emphasize that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3946)|
| 1:05:51| if we can do that, that might be a viable option for this commission to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3951)|
| 1:05:57| Now, with regard to an ad hoc committee, someone is going to make recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3957)|
| 1:06:03| about if the county does continue to own that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3963)|
| 1:06:07| and a business park is not an option, as we've heard from the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3967)|
| 1:06:13| then the ad hoc committee will probably be the folks that make recommendations for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3973)|
| 1:06:21| But that is a separate process from the sector plan and getting it adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3981)|
| 1:06:29| We encourage you to make the resolution or whatever is appropriate per the law director, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3989)|
| 1:06:37| so that this commission can vote to approve the sector plan as it was presented by the MPC for 2010| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=3997)|
| 1:06:47| and leaving the Midway Road slash EEC07 as it's currently zoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4007)|
| 1:06:53| And then we'll all have an opportunity to address the future use of that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4013)|
| 1:06:58| because it's the taxpayers that own the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4018)|
| 1:07:01| We keep talking about the development corporation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4021)|
| 1:07:03| but its resources came from this body and the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4023)|
| 1:07:09| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4029)|
| 1:07:12| Yes. Name and address of the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4032)|
| 1:07:14| Lisa Starbuck, 6233 Babley Road, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4034)|
| 1:07:19| I would like to echo most of Bob's comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4039)|
| 1:07:21| and also say that I'm very disappointed that we didn't know anything about this prior to it happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4041)|
| 1:07:29| It wasn't on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4049)|
| 1:07:30| It wasn't noticed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4050)|
| 1:07:31| We were at the meeting today and nobody said anything about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4051)|
| 1:07:35| I was under the impression that you couldn't vote on something unless it was on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4055)|
| 1:07:41| So I don't know if it got added to the agenda somehow and we missed that or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4061)|
| 1:07:46| But anyway, I'd just like to express my disappointment that the people who have a lot invested in this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4066)|
| 1:07:55| you know, didn't know anything about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4075)|
| 1:07:57| And secondly, I would like to say with regard to the sector plan process, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4077)|
| 1:08:02| I was very interested to hear today some of the comments that the law director had to make about the sector plan process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4082)|
| 1:08:09| And Mr. Donaldson particularly struck me that one comment they made, and I don't remember which one it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4089)|
| 1:08:16| said the sector plan process is not about a particular piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4096)|
| 1:08:21| It's about looking at something for the whole region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4101)|
| 1:08:25| Well, I can tell you I've been a part of a lot of sector plan processes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4105)|
| 1:08:28| and this is the first and only process that I've ever been involved in where it did revolve around one property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4108)|
| 1:08:36| Now that property owner and that particular piece of property has driven this whole process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4116)|
| 1:08:41| and turned something that is normally a six- to nine-month process into a process over several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4121)|
| 1:08:48| And I would also like to say with regard to Mr. Anders' comment about input, this sector plan process, as I said, took years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4128)|
| 1:08:59| And I think that if you'll go back and look at the records, there was an enormous amount of turnout at every sector plan meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4139)|
| 1:09:08| In fact, it was far greater than any other sector plan process that has ever happened in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4148)|
| 1:09:15| Correct me if I'm wrong, Mr. Donaldson, but there were an enormous amount of people participated in this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4155)|
| 1:09:23| meeting after meeting, year after year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4163)|
| 1:09:27| And so, you know, I think there has been an adequate amount of public input, and it's time to put this sector plan to bed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4167)|
| 1:09:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4176)|
| 1:09:37| Mr. Anders, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4177)|
| 1:09:38| Yeah, Ms. Starbuck, my opinion wasn't about input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4178)|
| 1:09:41| I think the public has had great input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4181)|
| 1:09:44| My opinion is the property owners in the corridor must be notified that if they're going to have a, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4184)|
| 1:09:50| if they're going to have an overlay, if they're going to have a development overlay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4190)|
| 1:09:54| the people that are in the corridor must agree to that or I can't vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4194)|
| 1:09:58| That's just because it diminishes the value of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4198)|
| 1:10:01| Well, actually, it's not a zoning issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4201)|
| 1:10:04| It's just an overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4204)|
| 1:10:06| It's kind of like just a concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4206)|
| 1:10:08| It doesn't have any teeth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4208)|
| 1:10:09| It's kind of like your slope protection plan right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4209)|
| 1:10:12| You know, it doesn't have any real bearing on what you do with zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4212)|
| 1:10:17| I mean, if the property owner, my opinion is if the property owners are not notified of possible easement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4217)|
| 1:10:22| then it shouldn't be, should not be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4222)|
| 1:10:25| That's just my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4225)|
| 1:10:27| Mr. Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4227)|
| 1:10:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4230)|
| 1:10:34| We did not, this wasn't on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4234)|
| 1:10:37| We didn't vote to create anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4237)|
| 1:10:39| This is the mayor's committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4239)|
| 1:10:41| And Dean had come down and asked us if we would support the formation of this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4241)|
| 1:10:48| And I don't think any of us have anything against any group getting together to talk about visioning or new ideas or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4248)|
| 1:10:57| But when we asked who would be on the committee and Gloria had said Elaine Clark,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4257)|
| 1:11:06| at that point I had assumed that people had been informed of this and asked if they wanted to participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4266)|
| 1:11:13| And my understanding now is that, Elaine, you had not been approached about this either from this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4273)|
| 1:11:19| So, I mean, my.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4279)|
| 1:11:22| I was aware of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4282)|
| 1:11:24| I did not know anything official at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4284)|
| 1:11:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4288)|
| 1:11:33| So, the fact that a committee is being formed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4293)|
| 1:11:39| and the three people who have been most active in fighting the business park had not been discussed with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4299)|
| 1:11:50| or they had not been approached or asked to participate, I have concerns about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4310)|
| 1:11:56| There already have gotten communications from people questioning Gloria Ray's affiliation or relationship to the Development Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4316)|
| 1:12:05| And I just don't want to see this be another big mess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4325)|
| 1:12:10| So, this isn't something that the commission created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4330)|
| 1:12:14| This is the mayor's doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4334)|
| 1:12:16| And I'm sorry now that I didn't ask more questions this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4336)|
| 1:12:24| So, that's my mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4344)|
| 1:12:26| And I apologize for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4346)|
| 1:12:28| But I do hope that going forward, any group that gets together to talk about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4348)|
| 1:12:33| and all of these meetings I'm assuming will be open and noticed and that anyone can come and participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4353)|
| 1:12:39| But I do hope that the mayor or Gloria or whoever is doing this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4359)|
| 1:12:45| will have, will show some respect for the community and the people who have put the work into this to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4365)|
| 1:12:55| Is there any other business to come before the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4375)|
| 1:12:58| Yes, Sam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4378)|
| 1:12:59| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4379)|
| 1:13:00| Oh, Sam's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4380)|
| 1:13:01| Well, you know, I definitely don't want to belabor this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4381)|
| 1:13:08| but it sounds like a lot of the statements out here sound like they're somehow conspiracy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4388)|
| 1:13:14| And it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4394)|
| 1:13:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4396)|
| 1:13:17| Ms. Clark was approached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4397)|
| 1:13:20| We pushed Gloria into giving us names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4400)|
| 1:13:24| And so when she gave us names, it's because Ms. Clark was approached but probably not finalized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4404)|
| 1:13:30| And she was apprehensive about giving us names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4410)|
| 1:13:34| So she has committed before, into the mic, before the county, that she will have folks from all entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4414)|
| 1:13:45| We have no reason to distrust her or the mayor or anyone else about this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4425)|
| 1:13:51| Now, whether we pass a resolution or not next month, I'm glad to hear it's probably a moot point about this committee going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4431)|
| 1:14:00| So, you know, I guess, and then, too, I don't want to let the bloggers run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4440)|
| 1:14:07| Whoever we come up with, Gloria Ray, the Pope, someone's going to have a negative statement to say about that lead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4447)|
| 1:14:18| We'll get negative emails about whomever we choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4458)|
| 1:14:23| I think, as Commissioner Norman so eloquently put, she's thinking about an alternative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4463)|
| 1:14:31| There will not be a business part brought to this committee for us to reconsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4471)|
| 1:14:37| That's not her charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4477)|
| 1:14:40| It's definitely not her charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4480)|
| 1:14:43| That's not the mandate that came from this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4483)|
| 1:14:46| I was on the minority side, but this body spoke clearly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4486)|
| 1:14:51| And I think the county residents heard that and agreed with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4491)|
| 1:14:56| So, you know, for there to be this mindset that somehow something's going to come through the back door| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4496)|
| 1:15:01| and we'll end up with a business park in Midway, I think is a little disingenuous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4501)|
| 1:15:06| And I'm not saying any one individual, I just think when we start talking about conspiracies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4506)|
| 1:15:11| and people not wanting what side this chair is coming from, we kind of feed that fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4511)|
| 1:15:18| Let's say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4518)|
| 1:15:21| Commission spoke clearly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4521)|
| 1:15:24| The county residents have spoken clearly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4524)|
| 1:15:27| This has been a three-year process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4527)|
| 1:15:30| I think MPC doesn't mind a few months process, whether this passes or not next month, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4530)|
| 1:15:36| But don't mind, wouldn't mind a few months process to allow this conversation to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4536)|
| 1:15:41| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4541)|
| 1:15:44| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4544)|
| 1:15:46| You and I are on the same page on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4546)|
| 1:15:48| There's no conspiracy here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4548)|
| 1:15:50| Do we have a short comment from the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4550)|
| 1:15:52| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4552)|
| 1:15:54| Mr. Chairman and Commission, we just want to make clear that we, I don't know anything about a conspiracy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4554)|
| 1:16:00| I never implied that, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4560)|
| 1:16:03| Never called your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4563)|
| 1:16:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4564)|
| 1:16:05| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4565)|
| 1:16:07| Nor did we say either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4567)|
| 1:16:08| To be candid, what we anticipated was is we were, when we heard about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4568)|
| 1:16:14| was that this ad hoc committee might want to do its work before the sector plan gets sent back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4574)|
| 1:16:25| and then ultimately approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4585)|
| 1:16:27| And we don't see them as two components that have to happen at the same time or in sequence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4587)|
| 1:16:33| And I think Mr. Donaldson agreed with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4593)|
| 1:16:36| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4596)|
| 1:16:37| And so we want to make sure that we're not opposed to the ad hoc committee, one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4597)|
| 1:16:40| but we don't think the ad hoc committee has to offer its opinion to get the sector plan adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4600)|
| 1:16:45| And we want to make sure that this commission knows that we're not conspiracy theorists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4605)|
| 1:16:53| And, two, we just are very hopeful that this plan can get adopted as Commissioner Wright has articulated it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4613)|
| 1:17:00| And thank you for your time and thank you for staying so late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4620)|
| 1:17:03| We appreciate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4623)|
| 1:17:05| Mr. Law Director, in connection to this, do you have, do I need to speak to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4625)|
| 1:17:11| or do you have the directive here of what, do you have a flavor of the direction that we're headed in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4631)|
| 1:17:20| No, I'd rather Mark Donaldson do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4640)|
| 1:17:26| Could I get, yeah, I heard that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4646)|
| 1:17:28| Can I get you and Mark Donaldson together so that you can prepare in proper form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4648)|
| 1:17:33| that he would be, that he would accept if we subsequently approve it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4653)|
| 1:17:38| That's my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4658)|
| 1:17:39| We're prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4659)|
| 1:17:40| We have watched this constantly from the beginning and all we need is guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4660)|
| 1:17:43| I think we've received that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4663)|
| 1:17:44| We can go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4664)|
| 1:17:45| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4665)|
| 1:17:48| Seeing no other business for the commission, we are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part2?start=4668)|
