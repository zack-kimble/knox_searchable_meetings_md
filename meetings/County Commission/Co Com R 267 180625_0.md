| 0:13:26| It's time for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=806)|
| 0:13:36| I have eight people that have signed up for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=816)|
| 0:13:39| The first on my list is Fred Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=819)|
| 0:13:42| Mr. Martin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=822)|

| 0:14:35| Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=875)|
| 0:14:36| Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=876)|
| 0:14:37| I think a lot of those are for zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=877)|
| 0:14:40| I know, but they signed up, so I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=880)|
| 0:14:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=885)|
| 0:14:46| You want to wait until then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=886)|
| 0:14:47| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=887)|
| 0:14:52| Same thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=892)|
| 0:14:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=893)|
| 0:14:56| Shirley Hams?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=896)|
| 0:15:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=903)|
| 0:15:05| That's public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=905)|
| 0:15:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=914)|
| 0:15:16| David Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=916)|
| 0:15:17| David Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=917)|
| 0:15:18| David Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=918)|
| 0:15:22| How are you, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=922)|
| 0:15:23| If you would, please give your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=923)|
| 0:15:25| David Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=925)|
| 0:15:26| I reside at 505 Hollywood Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=926)|
| 0:15:28| I'm president of the Pond Gap Neighborhood Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=928)|
| 0:15:30| I'm a fourth generation Pond Gap resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=930)|
| 0:15:33| It's very unusual for Williams to move to the head of the line like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=933)|
| 0:15:37| I want to describe a project to you that we're anticipating through the Pond Gap Neighborhood Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=937)|
| 0:15:42| and others on Sutherland Avenue across from the Dead End Barbecue for a pocket park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=942)|
| 0:15:47| There's a narrow stretch of land about 350 feet by 30 that's between UT's fence at the sports fields and Sutherland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=947)|
| 0:15:55| It's about 80% UT property, 20% city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=955)|
| 0:15:58| And this pocket park would commemorate amateur baseball games played close to that site in the 30s, 40s, and 50s| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=958)|
| 0:16:05| that really brought the races together in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=965)|
| 0:16:09| People outside the community, which my uncle admitted, just do not know anything about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=969)|
| 0:16:14| Jack Neely, the Knoxville historian, said that he didn't know anything about it either,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=974)|
| 0:16:18| but he was not at all surprised by the racial harmony and camaraderie that the neighborhood evidenced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=978)|
| 0:16:25| We're a diverse community then and now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=985)|
| 0:16:28| Jack said that in 1960, Otis Redding had a concert before mixed audiences at the National Guard Armory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=988)|
| 0:16:35| I think I remember my uncle going to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=995)|
| 0:16:37| I was eight years old at the time, so if my memory fails me, you know why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=997)|
| 0:16:41| What this pocket park would be, metal baseball figures which would commemorate some of the players that played there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=1001)|
| 0:16:47| It would be a park that people could use every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=1007)|
| 0:16:50| It would have picnic tables because the community came together and shared a picnic lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=1010)|
| 0:16:55| It was quite common for black and white families in the neighborhood to come together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=1015)|
| 0:16:59| share a picnic lunch, and watch the games.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=1019)|
| 0:17:02| Some of the teams were all white, some all black, some mixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=1022)|
| 0:17:05| Arguably, the best team that played there were the Bearden Tigers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=1025)|
| 0:17:08| who had a left-handed third baseman and a one-armed pitcher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=1028)|
| 0:17:13| I was discussing this project with the principal at West High.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=1033)|
| 0:17:16| She was overwhelmed about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=1036)|
| 0:17:18| I said, David, what do you want us to do? We'll do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=1038)|
| 0:17:20| We want to involve the school, the baseball team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=1040)|
| 0:17:23| I got a contact with UT, so pray everything will go together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=1043)|
| 0:17:27| Getting back to the West High principal, she honored one of the first black students that attended West back in the springtime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=1047)|
| 0:17:34| If you could, maybe sometime after you discuss it among yourself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=1054)|
| 0:17:39| if you could have some kind of informal proclamation urging all the sides to work on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=1059)|
| 0:17:44| and just to commemorate the wonderful camaraderie that the teams brought forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=1064)|
| 0:17:49| I'll conclude my remarks by showing you an actual design of what the park would look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=1069)|
| 0:18:15| I'll conclude by saying we're all God's children, so I'll get me in trouble at the ACLU,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=1095)|
| 0:18:20| but this brings everybody together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=1100)|
| 0:18:22| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=1102)|
| 0:18:29| David does a lot of great things for the Pond Gap community and has for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=1109)|
| 0:18:33| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=1113)|
| 0:18:38| What I wanted to say is I do want to formally recognize and thank David Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=1118)|
| 0:18:43| Pond Gap is in the fourth district, and David is the proverbial mayor of Pond Gap,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=1123)|
| 0:18:49| not just in terms of organizing the community association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=1129)|
| 0:18:53| He has consistently been a passionate advocate for that community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=1133)|
| 0:18:57| and we're very, very lucky to have him over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=1137)|
| 0:19:02| He's just a great guy, and once again, thank you, David,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=1142)|
| 0:19:06| and I'm sure we'll be able to work on some sort of support for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=1146)|
| 0:19:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=1151)|
| 0:19:13| Before we go any further, I'd like to recognize the appointed and elected officials in attendance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=1153)|
| 0:19:18| We have Superintendent of Schools Bob Thomas, State Representative Jimmy Matlock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=1158)|
| 0:19:23| and, of course, Knox County Mayor Tim Burchett with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=1163)|
| 0:19:26| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=1166)|
| 0:19:29| Louise Pablum, Alderman Town of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=1169)|
| 0:19:35| There she is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=1175)|
| 0:19:37| Thank you all for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=1177)|
| 0:19:43| Let me check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=1183)|
| 0:19:44| We've got a proclamation, and I want to see, has Anthony arrived yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=1184)|
| 0:19:51| So we may want to move to the next thing and come back to Hayden's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=1191)|
| 0:19:54| If we could, Item 55 is a presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=1194)|
| 0:19:57| If that person is here, we could go ahead and do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=1197)|
| 0:20:00| Are they here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=1200)|
| 0:20:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=1202)|
| 0:20:06| Page 12, Number 55, presentation of the Seven Islands Birding Park by Park Manager Justine Kuchara.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=1206)|
| 0:20:16| Ma'am, if you would, please give your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=1216)|
| 0:20:18| My name is Justine Kuchara.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=1218)|
| 0:20:20| I'm the manager at Seven Islands State Birding Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=1220)|
| 0:20:23| and I'm really just here today to kind of introduce myself and introduce the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=1223)|
| 0:20:28| Seven Islands has been a state park in Knox County for almost the past four years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=1228)|
| 0:20:34| but we still very much feel kind of like the new kid on the block,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=1234)|
| 0:20:37| and we hear from people a lot that they don't even know we're there yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=1237)|
| 0:20:42| It's a beautiful park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=1242)|
| 0:20:43| It's a day-use park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=1243)|
| 0:20:45| There's about 416 acres, and we have approximately nine miles of walking trail currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=1245)|
| 0:20:53| Most people that come to the park come for exercise, to take pictures, to walk their dogs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=1253)|
| 0:20:59| just to enjoy nature, and then certainly we have our share of birders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=1259)|
| 0:21:04| Birders are one of the most, quote-unquote, valuable, I don't want to call them volunteers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=1264)|
| 0:21:11| We're all volunteers, tourist types out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=1271)|
| 0:21:14| So we're hoping that having a birding park will be a really great economic bolster for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=1274)|
| 0:21:21| We're right on the little map up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=1281)|
| 0:21:24| We're kind of the last little green wiggle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=1284)|
| 0:21:26| and I have plenty of maps to share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=1286)|
| 0:21:31| I don't know if you'll have a place where that can go after I leave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=1291)|
| 0:21:34| and some brochures and also my contact information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=1294)|
| 0:21:37| And I'm really just here today to encourage you to reach out to Seven Islands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=1297)|
| 0:21:41| We have a strong presence on social media, Facebook, Instagram.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=1301)|
| 0:21:45| It's a great way to find out about our programming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=1305)|
| 0:21:47| and about other things that are going to be going on at the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=1307)|
| 0:21:51| And that's all I have for you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=1311)|
| 0:21:55| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=1315)|
| 0:21:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=1316)|
| 0:22:01| Ma'am, if you would, pass that information to Drew over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=1321)|

| 0:22:33| Do I have a motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=1353)|

| 0:22:39| Opposed say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=1359)|
| 0:22:40| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=1360)|
| 0:22:41| Commissioner Brantley, will you do us the honor of reading this resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=1361)|
| 0:22:44| My pleasure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=1364)|

| 0:26:38| and without the support of good scouters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=1598)|
| 0:26:42| often that can help make a difference of a scout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=1602)|
| 0:26:45| And Anthony, I'll also let you know, his father,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=1605)|
| 0:26:49| is the only person I can say with conviction that is worse with puns than I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=1609)|

| 0:47:35| It's been brought up that the creek was contaminated. I went and had the water tested. Everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=2855)|
| 0:47:45| came back negative except for E. coli, which comes from animal feces. And as you all would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=2865)|
| 0:47:50| have seen when you came out and walked the road, the neighbor down there in the trailer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=2870)|
| 0:47:55| has chickens running free. So that's where the E. coli comes from. But the rest of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=2875)|
| 0:48:00| water, besides E. coli, the water was fine. And that was tested by micro-backed laboratories| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=2880)|
| 0:48:06| in Maryville, Tennessee. So the whole thing of the water being contaminated is not. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=2886)|
| 0:48:12| also, in 2009 when our church burned down, the church was short by $150,000. We didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=2892)|
| 0:48:23| get any money from the government. We went out and worked and took care of it and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=2903)|
| 0:48:29| church rebuilt. If the county wants to close our road just to clean the dump up, I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=2909)|
| 0:48:36| spoken to the lady who owns that piece of property finally. We finally made contact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=2916)|
| 0:48:41| She has already stated that she and her brothers are willing to give the church the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=2921)|
| 0:48:47| If you all want to close the road on the way to clean it, then we'll come up and we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=2927)|
| 0:48:52| clean the road and clean it up ourselves because she's willing to give the church the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=2932)|
| 0:48:56| anyway. But we don't want the road closed. So if the only way you all want to clean it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=2936)|
| 0:49:01| is by closing the road, then leave the road open and we'll clean the mess up. Because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=2941)|
| 0:49:07| we didn't look out for handouts before and we won't look out for handouts to clean the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=2947)|
| 0:49:13| mess up. The lady never was given a clean or desist. There was a statement that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=2953)|
| 0:49:19| emailed to all of you all last week from her because she couldn't be here this evening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=2959)|
| 0:49:25| because she had to fly out with a sickly aunt. And her other two siblings that own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=2965)|
| 0:49:30| the property with her don't even live in Tennessee. They never knew that the place was getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=2970)|
| 0:49:34| dumped on. Also last week it was noted in the statement that in 2000 our pastor asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=2974)|
| 0:49:42| the county to put the fence back up when the tree fell over and it was ignored and never| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=2982)|
| 0:49:47| put back up. And then all these years, if the county was that concerned, why is it she| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=2987)|
| 0:49:52| never got one clean notice until now and when you want to close the road? Anybody anywhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=2992)|
| 0:50:01| else, there's protocol. They should have gotten notices saying the property is dumped on and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3001)|
| 0:50:06| it should have been cleaned, but she never got a single one. And that statement has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3006)|
| 0:50:10| given to you all as an affidavit. So if the only way you all want to clean the mess up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3010)|
| 0:50:15| is by closing the road, then fine, we'll clean the mess up ourselves. We have no problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3015)|
| 0:50:20| taking that on. I've spoke to my dad, which is a deacon. I'm on the trustee board. We'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3020)|
| 0:50:25| clean it ourselves. My uncle has equipment and we'll go through and clean it ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3025)|
| 0:50:31| The lady's willing to give us the property, but closing the road and taking our civil| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3031)|
| 0:50:35| liberties away because of everybody's screw-ups. And that's what it is, the screw-ups. Because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3035)|
| 0:50:42| the county government never wrote the lady or anybody with that property and told them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3042)|
| 0:50:47| it needed to be cleaned and that there was any dumping. And then also we asked 18 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3047)|
| 0:50:53| ago now, and it's stated 18 years ago, we asked for them to put the fence back up and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3053)|
| 0:50:58| they didn't put the fence back up. So that's nothing but screw-ups. And now you want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3058)|
| 0:51:02| take our civil liberties away. And that's not right. And like I said again, if that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3062)|
| 0:51:07| the only way you all want to clean the mess up, we'll clean it up ourselves. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3067)|

| 0:51:39| have been coming to the meetings and I guess as my trustee just stated, there's a problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3099)|
| 0:51:45| that if I guess the funding, $115,000 to $120,000 I think was the last meeting that I heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3105)|
| 0:51:53| that it would cost them. There was a problem that they thought if they spent that money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3113)|
| 0:51:58| that they would come back in and re-dump it. So that's primarily why they want the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3118)|
| 0:52:04| closed. We can't give a guarantee that it won't happen again. So my thoughts is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3124)|
| 0:52:10| life has no guarantees. I mean, it's almost like I guess the first meeting that I came| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3130)|
| 0:52:15| to that unless we agree for the closing of the road that the county feels that they can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3135)|
| 0:52:22| because we can't guarantee it won't happen again, then many of you won't give the money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3142)|
| 0:52:28| necessary to have it cleaned up. So the community on Twin Creek is impacted. I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3148)|
| 0:52:35| somebody said, well, it's just three minutes. But if you go certain times of the day, I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3155)|
| 0:52:40| John Servier, that three minutes can turn into 10 minutes and can turn into 15 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3160)|
| 0:52:47| So I think that is an inaccurate statement because certain times in the morning and certain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3167)|
| 0:52:52| times in the evening, it is a hassle to get out on John Servier and to make that turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3172)|
| 0:53:00| So traffic backs up for miles in both directions. So I think it has impacted us, our church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3180)|
| 0:53:08| It has impacted the residents on Twin Creek. And I know it's easiest I guess for the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3188)|
| 0:53:15| or whatever to say, well, let's just close the road. But the residents on Twin Creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3195)|
| 0:53:20| and the people of the church on Twin Creek, we have been impacted on something we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3200)|
| 0:53:25| nothing to do with. We're not dumping things out. So I see your point of view, but I'd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3205)|
| 0:53:32| ask that the commission please consider the community. Please consider there's elderly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3212)|
| 0:53:38| that live on Twin Creek. Please consider that we have elderly people that come to our church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3218)|
| 0:53:43| that to drive around the extra three minutes can be very dangerous on John Servier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3223)|
| 0:53:50| John Servier is a high-speed highway, and it's getting more and more congested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3230)|
| 0:53:56| Anybody that lives out in there can tell you. I mean, it used to be years ago you could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3236)|
| 0:54:00| go at any time and get out and go. But now to lose that access and to close that road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3240)|
| 0:54:07| I think it's a detriment to the church. It's a detriment to the community and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3247)|
| 0:54:12| citizens that live there. So we just hope, as I say, that you all would reconsider the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3252)|
| 0:54:18| permanent closing and reconsider that the effects that it has had and that we'll have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3258)|
| 0:54:24| we believe, on that community. We need more access instead of less access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3264)|
| 0:54:30| So hopefully, as I say, that's the only reason I came tonight and have been coming to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3270)|
| 0:54:35| meetings is to realize that this has been a 60- to 80-year problem. This just didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3275)|
| 0:54:41| happen over a couple of years or two or three years or even five years. This is a 60- to 80-year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3281)|
| 0:54:46| problem that has grown and grown and grown and gotten to the point that you saw as you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3286)|
| 0:54:51| came and walked the road. So we can step out our back door and we can see it from the church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3291)|
| 0:54:58| the trash and so forth, but I think we've dealt with that. So I guess the closing of the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3298)|
| 0:55:05| and seeing how it has impacted already and how it continues to impact, I guess we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3305)|
| 0:55:14| like the trash, but having the road closed versus the trash, I guess for the residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3314)|
| 0:55:21| and my church petitioners, we'd better at least have that access and deal with the trash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3321)|
| 0:55:28| I know one gentleman said, well, my children can't play in the creek. I would feel more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3328)|
| 0:55:33| safer in playing in that creek than going down into Lake Loudon and getting in the lake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3333)|
| 0:55:38| So as Brother June has said, the tests have already came back, so I'd feel a lot safer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3338)|
| 0:55:43| with my children playing in that creek than even going into Lake Loudon. So I just hope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3343)|
| 0:55:49| that the commission and the ladies and gentlemen on the commission would consider that impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3349)|
| 0:55:53| if you would, please, before you decide what way you vote. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3353)|
| 0:55:58| Thank you, sir. Shirley Harris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3358)|
| 0:56:21| If you would, please, ma'am, give your name and address for the record. You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3381)|
| 0:56:25| Shirley Harris, 5652 Washington Pike, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3385)|
| 0:56:32| I attend Harris Chapel Baptist Church, and I wanted to give a little history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3392)|
| 0:56:39| The churches and the burial grounds have been there for 140 years. It's one of the oldest roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3399)|
| 0:56:45| in Knox County. And three races came together, donated land, material, and property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3405)|
| 0:56:54| to build this up. And we've lasted that long without any help from the government, from banks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3414)|
| 0:57:00| or any other outside institutions. We were burned to the ground in 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3420)|
| 0:57:08| We again got together as a community and built the church back up until it's as nice a church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3428)|
| 0:57:14| as any church in the city. I don't understand if we came together once why we can't do it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3434)|
| 0:57:21| And it has been said to us that we will do it again with the help of the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3441)|
| 0:57:27| or without the help of the commission rather than see this destroyed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3447)|
| 0:57:32| Because like I said, it was three races, Cherokee, black, and white that got together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3452)|
| 0:57:39| There was no place for their children to go to school, so they built this so that their children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3459)|
| 0:57:44| could be educated religiously and scholastically. Also, my major concern is if we close off one end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3464)|
| 0:57:53| of that road, that makes it a dead end road. If there's a chemical spill on John Sevier Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3473)|
| 0:58:00| and they close that off, how are we to get out? We're landlocked in there. That's my major concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3480)|
| 0:58:09| If there were a chemical spill, there are tractor and trailer trucks that go up John Sevier Highway every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3489)|
| 0:58:16| If that is the only way out of that area and something happens, how are the residents going to get out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3496)|
| 0:58:24| if that other end of that road is closed? That's all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3504)|
| 0:58:30| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3510)|
| 0:58:36| Is there any discussion among the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3516)|
| 0:58:43| Vice Chair Bressler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3523)|
| 0:58:47| He recognized you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3527)|
| 0:58:54| Dwight, could you come up here? I need to ask you a couple questions, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3534)|
| 0:59:12| Thank you. The question is here, Julian back there said something about that they would come together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3552)|
| 0:59:20| and they would clean that up. It's kind of intriguing that they would take responsibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3560)|
| 0:59:27| but they don't own the land yet. If they make a commitment like that to the county to clean it up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3567)|
| 0:59:35| we could save a lot of money for the county if they wanted to clean up that mess themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3575)|
| 0:59:43| Then they would be looking after it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3583)|
| 0:59:48| It kind of bothers me that we are going to punish some innocent people because of the bad actions of other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3588)|
| 0:59:58| I don't know how we're going to cure that, but if we close that off, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3598)|
| 1:00:04| that dump site is going to move someplace else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3604)|
| 1:00:11| I just hate to take away those people that live in that community that use that road, the access to that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3611)|
| 1:00:23| I hate to spend tax dollars on cleaning up something that's going to move someplace else that we'll have to address it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3623)|
| 1:00:30| I'm asking you, if they commit to cleaning that up, if they get the property and they clean it up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3630)|
| 1:00:37| it will be their responsibility from here on out to get files from the county saying if there's dump out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3637)|
| 1:00:44| they've got to clean it up. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3644)|
| 1:00:49| It would continue to be the responsibility of the private property owner to keep the property clean, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3649)|
| 1:00:54| or whether that's the church or the family that presently owns it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3654)|
| 1:00:59| I would take note that the affidavit that Mr. Underwood, the attorney who was here last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3659)|
| 1:01:05| filed on behalf of the current property owner stated that the county held blame or fault for the dumping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3665)|
| 1:01:14| The right-of-way on Twin Creek extends basically from edge of pavement to edge of pavement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3674)|
| 1:01:19| so they took the position that anything that was dumped from the road onto the property was the responsibility of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3679)|
| 1:01:26| I will tell you that concerns me because everything that's dumped on Twin Creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3686)|
| 1:01:31| if it's coming off the road, obviously it's being dumped by somebody that's using our facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3691)|
| 1:01:38| So our property is just the asphalt. It's not any of the property off the edge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3698)|
| 1:01:43| You said from edge to edge is what we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3703)|
| 1:01:46| Yes, sir, that's how it appears. That's not uncharacteristic of a road this old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3706)|
| 1:01:55| Okay, but it's up to the responsibility basically right now of the property owner to clean that up correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3715)|
| 1:02:05| That is what is really here. The private citizen has the responsibility of that, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3725)|
| 1:02:11| Yes, sir, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3731)|
| 1:02:15| Let me ask Mr. Julian something. Could you come down here, Mr. Julian?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3735)|
| 1:02:34| Yes, sir, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3754)|
| 1:02:36| You know what we just said from edge to edge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3756)|
| 1:02:40| Anything that's off that pavement is your responsibility, even keeping the trim. That's your responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3760)|
| 1:02:50| Yes, we understand that, but if that's what it takes to keep our road open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3770)|
| 1:02:55| then I've even spoken to our deacon, which is my dad, and it was his idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3775)|
| 1:03:00| I've spoken to my mom, which she just got up and spoke. She's also on the trustee board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3780)|
| 1:03:05| Like I said, if that's what it takes to keep our road open, give us some time to get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3785)|
| 1:03:10| I know the community will come out and come together. We did before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3790)|
| 1:03:14| The church, like I said, we were $125,000 in the deficit of building their church back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3794)|
| 1:03:19| because the new insurance hadn't went into effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3799)|
| 1:03:22| We're debt free, and the church is rebuilt. It cost us $320,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3802)|
| 1:03:27| Okay, we've got an affidavit filed against us, and it's our responsibility. Correct, Dwight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3807)|
| 1:03:35| So somebody's told us it's our responsibility to clean that up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3815)|
| 1:03:40| but will you and your church take that responsibility away from the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3820)|
| 1:03:46| Yes, if that's what it takes to get our road open, for you to say keep the road open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3826)|
| 1:03:51| then yes, we will take on the responsibility and get the road cleaned up and get the area cleaned up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3831)|
| 1:03:56| My uncle has bobcats and other equipment, and we can get it cleaned up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3836)|
| 1:04:04| If we do something like that, Dwight, how soon would you expect them to start cleaning up as soon as we leave here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3844)|
| 1:04:12| How long would you give them to clean that up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3852)|
| 1:04:22| I think, Commissioner, I'd probably want to confer with the law director's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3862)|
| 1:04:25| We view these things through the International Property Maintenance Code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3865)|
| 1:04:29| It would give us some latitude, I think, to look at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3869)|
| 1:04:34| but that's probably something I'd want to seek some guidance from the law director's office on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3874)|
| 1:04:38| But the body of standards that we observe, I mean, these aren't things that we just do on an ad hoc or an arbitrary basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3878)|
| 1:04:46| It's under the International Code Council's 2012 body of codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3886)|
| 1:04:51| It's been approved by this commission, and the relevant section is the International Property Maintenance Code, the IPMC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3891)|
| 1:04:57| So we'd look at it through that lens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3897)|
| 1:04:59| But I wouldn't stand here today and tell you that we would expect cleanup efforts to start the next day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3899)|
| 1:05:08| On the other hand, I do think some reasonable framework would have to be established| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3908)|
| 1:05:12| in order to determine a good faith effort being made by the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3912)|
| 1:05:18| I would just urge a little bit of caution here because, again, I appreciate the representations of the church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3918)|
| 1:05:24| but at this time they don't own the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3924)|
| 1:05:28| And so I'd ask the commission to consider those assurances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3928)|
| 1:05:31| and at least look for some form of validation because the property owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3931)|
| 1:05:37| two of whom are out of state, are not here to speak for themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3937)|
| 1:05:45| The lady who lives here, Howard Moran, she will be back in the town around July the 12th, she told me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3945)|
| 1:05:53| She flew out this evening at 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3953)|
| 1:05:55| So I wasn't able because we just met her last Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3955)|
| 1:06:00| I couldn't get that together, but she's ready to file the paperwork| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3960)|
| 1:06:04| and sign the property over as a gift to the church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3964)|
| 1:06:09| Thank you. Just stay right there just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3969)|
| 1:06:11| Mr. Law Director, I've got a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3971)|
| 1:06:15| If they have the property, if they get the ownership of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3975)|
| 1:06:23| and they have committed publicly, would we need something signed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3983)|
| 1:06:28| or what would we need to make sure that their assurance to us that it would be cleaned up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3988)|
| 1:06:34| And I'm talking about saving the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3994)|
| 1:06:36| I'm not talking about cleaning the road up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3996)|
| 1:06:38| but we could save some money that's really not our responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=3998)|
| 1:06:42| What would we need to have that assurance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4002)|
| 1:06:47| Under the proposal that they're talking about right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4007)|
| 1:06:51| I think we as the law department could get in a conversation with these parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4011)|
| 1:06:57| Number one, they would have to have title of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4017)|
| 1:07:00| Number two, we would have to come to some formal agreement as to the standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4020)|
| 1:07:04| and time frames and what clean up really means for this body to be satisfied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4024)|
| 1:07:10| and for the engineering to be satisfied that clean up has occurred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4030)|
| 1:07:15| and probably present some formal agreement or settlement in this matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4035)|
| 1:07:20| unless this body gives us the authority to go ahead and settle it based upon legal principles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4040)|
| 1:07:27| But I think, I believe in good faith, but you're talking about real property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4047)|
| 1:07:32| and we have a statute of frauds issue here under the law whereby we have to have things in writing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4052)|
| 1:07:38| and I think we could work together with Dwight and his department and with the church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4058)|
| 1:07:45| and if they actually present a deed that they own the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4065)|
| 1:07:50| then that responsibility falls to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4070)|
| 1:07:53| All we're negotiating on then is what it takes to have the road remain open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4073)|
| 1:07:57| and what our expectations are and what clean up means and according to Dwight's standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4077)|
| 1:08:04| and if we all can come to agreement on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4084)|
| 1:08:06| we'll prepare some kind of document that will be binding between the parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4086)|
| 1:08:11| Dwight, how soon would you need, I mean we're allocating money to clean it up now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4091)|
| 1:08:17| but how soon would you need this documentation taken care of for them to start the clean up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4097)|
| 1:08:23| if we decide to go that route?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4103)|
| 1:08:29| I don't think we have a particular time frame in mind, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4109)|
| 1:08:32| We just work expeditiously with the church and the law director's office to try to move it forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4112)|
| 1:08:38| but there's nothing I'm aware of that would create an emergency of any sort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4118)|
| 1:08:47| I'd remind Commission the road's been closed since March,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4127)|
| 1:08:50| so we don't have the ongoing issue of dumping that we do have when the road is open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4130)|
| 1:08:55| So as long as we leave it in a closed condition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4135)|
| 1:08:58| we're comfortable that we won't have the issue of dumping reoccurring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4138)|
| 1:09:02| but if we were to open the road back up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4142)|
| 1:09:05| then I would think some sense of urgency is in order just to protect the county's risks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4145)|
| 1:09:12| Okay, but I'm looking at saving money here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4152)|
| 1:09:16| and he's given us a way that he would clean it or the church would clean it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4156)|
| 1:09:23| I understand, Commissioner, but again, we talk about this around the office a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4163)|
| 1:09:27| A lot of what we do in engineering and public works is manage risk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4167)|
| 1:09:30| and so should we go down this road and it be unsuccessful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4170)|
| 1:09:36| our remedy is going to be to clean up the property and put a lien on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4176)|
| 1:09:41| and then eventually the county would take recovery of their funds at the time that property changed hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4181)|
| 1:09:47| The harsh reality here is that you have a cleanup estimate that's well in excess of $100,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4187)|
| 1:09:53| and the appraisal on this parcel is $2,400.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4193)|
| 1:09:57| This property's appraised for $2,400.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4197)|
| 1:09:59| So our exposure would be a cleanup that's well into six figures against an asset that's worth $2,400.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4199)|
| 1:10:06| So we're open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4206)|
| 1:10:09| We'll follow the will of this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4209)|
| 1:10:13| but again, my job is to keep you informed as to the potential risks for any decision that you make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4213)|
| 1:10:19| and I would want you to know that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4219)|
| 1:10:21| There was another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4221)|
| 1:10:23| I think Chairman Smith here said, was there two parcels involved of land out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4223)|
| 1:10:32| In terms of notification, there's multiple parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4232)|
| 1:10:36| No, as far as the dump, the trash, two separate parcels or just one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4236)|
| 1:10:43| Principally just the one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4243)|
| 1:10:45| It's the Howard Moran parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4245)|
| 1:10:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4248)|
| 1:10:54| Commissioner Skidmark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4254)|
| 1:10:55| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4255)|
| 1:10:57| One, now the question is answered that you have a verbal commitment from the existing landowner to gift the parcel to the church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4257)|
| 1:11:06| Yes, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4266)|
| 1:11:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4267)|
| 1:11:08| And I've got witnesses as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4268)|
| 1:11:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4270)|
| 1:11:11| And then my other question really is for Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4271)|
| 1:11:14| I know he has worked a tremendous amount of time on this and talked to numerous folks that live in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4274)|
| 1:11:23| and based on this proposal, I'd kind of like to know what your thoughts are since this is in your district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4283)|
| 1:11:31| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4291)|
| 1:11:33| Like Mr. Vander Bay said, the road's been closed since March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4293)|
| 1:11:37| There's been zero dumping in the South Knoxville community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4297)|
| 1:11:42| Yes, it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4302)|
| 1:11:44| Like Mr. Harris says, it's been 60 years of people coming in there and dumping in my county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4304)|
| 1:11:51| Just around the curve, we've got an excavating company out of Blount County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4311)|
| 1:11:56| that's decided that they want to come in and do a landfill just right around the curve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4316)|
| 1:12:01| You know, I'm tired of people coming into my community and dumping into my community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4321)|
| 1:12:06| The only way to stop this would be to close the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4326)|
| 1:12:10| Now, if Mr. Vander Bay feels comfortable, I would have made my motion to postpone for 90 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4330)|
| 1:12:18| before they could go into discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4338)|
| 1:12:20| But to clean everybody that's been out there, to see how steep that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4340)|
| 1:12:26| it's going to cost $120,000 to clean that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4346)|
| 1:12:31| The first truck that goes through there and dumps 50 tires down in the bottom of that valley again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4351)|
| 1:12:39| they've got to be out there to clean it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4359)|
| 1:12:41| The next day, they've got to be out there to clean it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4361)|
| 1:12:44| It's not going to stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4364)|
| 1:12:45| As long as the road stays open, it's not going to stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4365)|
| 1:12:49| Now, if the church wants to go into an agreement that makes them liable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4369)|
| 1:12:54| totally liable, and the law department and Mr. Vander Bay is comfortable with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4374)|
| 1:13:01| but there needs to be a time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4381)|
| 1:13:03| If it's not done in one year, we're going to be right back here again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4383)|
| 1:13:07| And I don't think, I really believe that as long as the road's open, it's such an isolated stretch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4387)|
| 1:13:20| it's an uphill grade with about a 70-foot drop-off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4400)|
| 1:13:24| that anybody with a pickup truck going uphill, they can pull tires, trash, be gone in 30 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4404)|
| 1:13:33| That's all it takes is 30 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4413)|
| 1:13:35| So if Mr. Vander Bay is okay with it, and we'll go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4415)|
| 1:13:42| But I don't see the stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4422)|
| 1:13:45| My opinion is the dumping will never stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4425)|
| 1:13:49| It's known as the hopper in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4429)|
| 1:13:51| I've got a slide here that shows they're coming in from all parts of the county to dump over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4431)|
| 1:13:57| So I hope that answers your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4437)|
| 1:14:02| Commissioner Bressler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4442)|
| 1:14:03| Commissioner Bratley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4443)|
| 1:14:04| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4444)|
| 1:14:07| I am so impressed with the people who live on this road and that community for coming down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4447)|
| 1:14:12| You've had the biggest response of anyone since I've been on commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4452)|
| 1:14:16| I mean, you are dedicated, and I appreciate that very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4456)|
| 1:14:20| And because of that, I think you're good to your word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4460)|
| 1:14:23| I would suggest that the county spend the money, clean up the trash, and let's go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4463)|
| 1:14:28| But we can't be changing laws and changing property and signing property over to this person and making it legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4468)|
| 1:14:34| It's just a matter of going out and cleaning up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4474)|
| 1:14:37| Lots of us go out and pick up trash every week on our streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4477)|
| 1:14:41| There's no reason why they can't pick up trash on their streets, too, if they want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4481)|
| 1:14:45| And maybe people from other communities might come out there and say, we're going to work this weekend with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4485)|
| 1:14:50| We're going to help you pick up some trash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4490)|
| 1:14:52| That's okay, but I don't agree with making laws that this property owner has to do this, or you have to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4492)|
| 1:14:58| and you've got to be liable for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4498)|
| 1:15:00| Just go out there and clean it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4500)|
| 1:15:02| But I'm for you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4502)|
| 1:15:03| I'm changing my vote, because I don't think the road should be closed now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4503)|
| 1:15:07| Thank you, Commissioner, and also to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4507)|
| 1:15:11| I have also, when I spoke to the lady, she, like I said, she wanted to be here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4511)|
| 1:15:17| because she's got a sick 90-year-old aunt that she had to go check on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4517)|
| 1:15:22| But she's never heard from any of these, from the last 18 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4522)|
| 1:15:26| She's never got a single letter from the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4526)|
| 1:15:29| If we get the fence back up, and I know that we can get private funding to help us because of our church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4529)|
| 1:15:35| They helped us before to get the church built, and I know I can go back and get the private funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4535)|
| 1:15:40| So it won't cost us $120,000 to clean it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4540)|
| 1:15:44| I don't believe it will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4544)|
| 1:15:46| If that's the route we have to go, give us 18 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4546)|
| 1:15:50| Give us 18 months to get it together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4550)|
| 1:15:53| and I think we can get a fence back up, a lot better fence than the chain link fence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4553)|
| 1:15:57| so it don't get torn down that easy, and one that's taller than eight feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4557)|
| 1:16:01| so you can't throw over it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4561)|
| 1:16:03| And I think the dumping will stop, because the dumping did stop before 2000 when there was a fence up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4563)|
| 1:16:10| And also, I wanted to state that the dumping has moved, just like Commissioner Bussler said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4570)|
| 1:16:16| it has moved around the corner, because on Brown Road, they're dumping again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4576)|
| 1:16:21| And they've cleaned it up the first time, and I just drove down Brown Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4581)|
| 1:16:24| because our pastor lives on Brown Road, and right at the corner of Martin Mill and Brown Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4584)|
| 1:16:29| they went back and dumped again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4589)|
| 1:16:31| So just as you said, it just moved from one place to the next place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4591)|
| 1:16:35| And they're also still dumping down Martin Mill onto Twin Creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4595)|
| 1:16:39| because I've gotten new pictures of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4599)|
| 1:16:41| They're dumping from the top of Martin Mill Pike down onto Twin Creek, as we speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4601)|
| 1:16:47| So the only real thing that's going to stop it is if we actually can catch the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4607)|
| 1:16:52| and actually put them in jail, but that's a whole other discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4612)|
| 1:16:55| because we've discussed that the fine's not high enough to do anything about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4615)|
| 1:16:59| that really makes people want to stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4619)|
| 1:17:01| But that's the only way we're ever going to really stop people from dumping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4621)|
| 1:17:05| is to make it to where it's going to hurt them to dump.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4625)|
| 1:17:10| Or just like you said, Commissioner Busley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4630)|
| 1:17:12| they're just going to move from one place to the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4632)|
| 1:17:16| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4636)|
| 1:17:18| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4638)|
| 1:17:20| You know, I want to say that the county has been exposed for 60 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4640)|
| 1:17:24| with the amount of trash that has been dumped in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4644)|
| 1:17:27| We need to clean up this trash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4647)|
| 1:17:29| And I am not comfortable with the church taking on the responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4649)|
| 1:17:33| of cleaning up the amount of trash that has been dumped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4653)|
| 1:17:38| The remediation of that is still very costly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4658)|
| 1:17:42| And the concerns of the community about the road closure is significant to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4662)|
| 1:17:52| which is separate from the amount of trash that has been dumped on this road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4672)|
| 1:17:56| for the past 60 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4676)|
| 1:17:58| And I assure you that people are just going to find another spot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4678)|
| 1:18:01| to dump the amount of waste that has been dumped there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4681)|
| 1:18:05| Commissioner Nystrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4685)|
| 1:18:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4688)|
| 1:18:10| I guess, Julia, my one question on this is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4690)|
| 1:18:13| right now we're still talking about cleaning it up as is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4693)|
| 1:18:19| One thing you never talked about is, is this something in the long run,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4699)|
| 1:18:23| if this stuff we've been talking about were to happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4703)|
| 1:18:26| how would your church be with the long-term maintenance issue here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4706)|
| 1:18:30| I know it's relatively easy to get a quick claim to transfer the property over there to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4710)|
| 1:18:35| but you potentially run the risk if the property gets trashed again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4715)|
| 1:18:41| and then if the county – earlier we had a proposal where we had the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4721)|
| 1:18:46| coming in to do a cleanup and then close the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4726)|
| 1:18:49| Now you do run the risk of the property getting trashed again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4729)|
| 1:18:53| and then if the county had to come in and do a cleanup,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4733)|
| 1:18:56| then filing a lien and then losing the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4736)|
| 1:18:59| So I guess from a risk management point of view,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4739)|
| 1:19:02| I'm looking at that as that's a risk you guys would run if you owned the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4742)|
| 1:19:06| I mean, how comfortable are you all with the long-term –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4746)|
| 1:19:08| Well, this is an idea I took from speaking with Commissioner Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4748)|
| 1:19:12| that he suggested to me a couple of months ago when we were speaking on the phone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4752)|
| 1:19:17| I think back in the end of April, about planting bamboo back up through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4757)|
| 1:19:22| And so if you make it thick enough – and you remember speaking to me about this, Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4762)|
| 1:19:27| I do, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4767)|
| 1:19:29| Planting bamboo up through there and letting it grow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4769)|
| 1:19:32| and putting the fence back up and watching it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4772)|
| 1:19:35| I mean, we drive up and through there every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4775)|
| 1:19:37| My pastor goes to the church and checks on it about every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4777)|
| 1:19:41| I drive through there every couple of days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4781)|
| 1:19:43| So if something gets dumped over there, we're going to catch it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4783)|
| 1:19:46| and be able to take care of it before it gets to a magnitude of huge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4786)|
| 1:19:49| huge out of control once it's cleaned up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4789)|
| 1:19:53| But I want to go back through and do what Commissioner Smith recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4793)|
| 1:19:57| was put bamboo through there because bamboo, once it gets growing and gets thick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4797)|
| 1:20:02| it's going to be hard to throw anything in there because bamboo just gets out of control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4802)|
| 1:20:06| and gets going and it will be so thick it won't be able to throw anything in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4806)|
| 1:20:13| And that was a suggestion from Commissioner Smith to me back in, I think it was the end of April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4813)|
| 1:20:18| And I think that's a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4818)|
| 1:20:22| Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4822)|
| 1:20:25| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4825)|
| 1:20:27| Mr. Law Director, if we go ahead and I think we probably need to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4827)|
| 1:20:35| I don't know whether we need to go ahead and vote and see if they close the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4835)|
| 1:20:38| or open the road or postpone it for 90 days and let the two sides get together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4838)|
| 1:20:43| and try to work out a deal, which I would really like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4843)|
| 1:20:47| is try to work out a deal that the church will, Mr. Harris has asked for 18 months to clean it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4847)|
| 1:20:54| And in part of that 18 months, if it's not cleaned up, then we can go back and close the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4854)|
| 1:21:00| And it's their responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4860)|
| 1:21:02| The fence is your responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4862)|
| 1:21:04| Edge of the road, everything would be the responsibility of the church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4864)|
| 1:21:10| I would like, if it's okay, I'd amend my motion to postpone for 90 days and let's discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4870)|
| 1:21:17| I'd like to make a motion to postpone for 90 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4877)|
| 1:21:20| for further discussions between the Harris Chapel and the-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4880)|
| 1:21:24| Who made the second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4884)|
| 1:21:25| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4885)|
| 1:21:26| Do you agree to the-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4886)|
| 1:21:27| I do, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4887)|
| 1:21:28| Okay, and you'll second the new one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4888)|
| 1:21:30| And I second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4890)|
| 1:21:35| Commissioner Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4895)|
| 1:21:37| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4897)|
| 1:21:41| I'm fine with what we just proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4901)|
| 1:21:44| I just sit here thinking, though, and I don't know what the number is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4904)|
| 1:21:48| but it's something we should keep in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4908)|
| 1:21:51| If this goes- I find it hard to believe this lady that owns it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4911)|
| 1:21:56| had no idea what condition the land was in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4916)|
| 1:22:00| She's been paying property taxes, I'm assuming, on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4920)|
| 1:22:03| I have never heard that she was late on property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4923)|
| 1:22:06| But if she gets out from underneath the property and the liability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4926)|
| 1:22:11| and gives it to the church and puts liability on them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4931)|
| 1:22:15| it also goes off the tax rolls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4935)|
| 1:22:18| It's $2,400.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4938)|
| 1:22:20| That's why I was wondering what it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4940)|
| 1:22:22| I didn't even know what it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4942)|
| 1:22:26| Taxes aren't that much anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4946)|
| 1:22:28| I do hate for any church to try to take on responsibility for property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4948)|
| 1:22:36| when I'm more interested in their responsibility for our souls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4956)|
| 1:22:42| God bless you for willing to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4962)|
| 1:22:45| But I'm a little bit worried about putting a bunch of-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4965)|
| 1:22:49| We just want a road open, Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4969)|
| 1:22:51| I appreciate what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4971)|
| 1:22:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4973)|
| 1:22:55| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4975)|
| 1:22:56| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4976)|
| 1:22:57| I'm still considerably concerned about the risk the church is willing to accept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4977)|
| 1:23:04| We've had 60 years of people dumping on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4984)|
| 1:23:07| And I think if the 90-day deferment is occurring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4987)|
| 1:23:11| that the brokered conversation must be some of the responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4991)|
| 1:23:16| for the remediation of that trash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4996)|
| 1:23:18| Whether it's being hauled off, the county bears some responsibility of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=4998)|
| 1:23:23| And the total cost should not be absorbed by the church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5003)|
| 1:23:27| simply because you want this road and the accessibility open in your community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5007)|
| 1:23:33| Commissioner, if I could speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5013)|
| 1:23:36| I think one of the things I want to do, a couple of things I'd like to do actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5016)|
| 1:23:42| is come away from this meeting with a clear sense of the direction this commission would like us to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5022)|
| 1:23:47| That's one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5027)|
| 1:23:48| And two, I'd like to set the church up for success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5028)|
| 1:23:51| And I'm a little concerned that the direction we're going in might not set them up for success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5031)|
| 1:23:55| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5035)|
| 1:23:56| So if it is the will of the body that we're going to go forward with the cleanup,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5036)|
| 1:24:00| I think it is a big undertaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5040)|
| 1:24:03| We are equipped and prepared to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5043)|
| 1:24:05| And I would submit to this body that I think I'd just prefer the commission to go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5045)|
| 1:24:15| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5055)|
| 1:24:16| I heard the noises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5056)|
| 1:24:17| Everybody else said evidently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5057)|
| 1:24:19| I'd just prefer we are equipped and set up to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5059)|
| 1:24:22| and I think in a way that the church at this point in time may not yet be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5062)|
| 1:24:25| So I'd submit to this body it might make sense to leave the road in a closed condition for a few more weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5065)|
| 1:24:32| let us go ahead and execute this agreement and get the cleanup done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5072)|
| 1:24:36| and then we'll have a clear understanding with the church of the condition of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5076)|
| 1:24:42| when they at this point hopefully have taken ownership of it and responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5082)|
| 1:24:49| And Commissioner Brantley, to your point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5089)|
| 1:24:50| this is not a responsibility any different from any other property owner in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5090)|
| 1:24:55| The IPMC applies equally to me, to you, to Commissioner Thomas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5095)|
| 1:24:59| any county resident that owns property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5099)|
| 1:25:01| These are the standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5101)|
| 1:25:02| There's nothing special or different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5102)|
| 1:25:04| But we'd have the property cleaned up and in good condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5104)|
| 1:25:08| We could all agree that that is the condition that it was in when the road is reopened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5108)|
| 1:25:15| and the church takes responsibility for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5115)|
| 1:25:17| and then if a year from now we're back here and we have a bad situation again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5117)|
| 1:25:23| I think we've made an honest effort and done noble work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5123)|
| 1:25:27| and we can revisit it at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5127)|
| 1:25:30| But I think we would serve everybody's interest well to set the church up for success,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5130)|
| 1:25:35| so let us go ahead and move forward with the cleanup prior to reopening the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5135)|
| 1:25:40| and then work from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5140)|
| 1:25:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5143)|
| 1:25:47| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5147)|
| 1:25:49| So we go ahead and clean up, and then, Julian, it will be you and your church's responsibility to keep it clean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5149)|
| 1:25:57| I mean, you need to set something up that they can't dump there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5157)|
| 1:26:02| or it's going to be very difficult for them to dump.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5162)|
| 1:26:06| Bamboo takes a little while to grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5166)|
| 1:26:08| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5168)|
| 1:26:09| Fencing is the other thing, but the fence will be your responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5169)|
| 1:26:13| I don't want to set the church up for failure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5173)|
| 1:26:18| I don't either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5178)|
| 1:26:20| As a trustee, as you know, a trustee's responsibility is the property of the church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5180)|
| 1:26:27| People who go to church know, and as a trustee, I worry about the property of the church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5187)|
| 1:26:31| That's my concern, and because the church did get burned down in 2009,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5191)|
| 1:26:37| I'm concerned of going to a one-way road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5197)|
| 1:26:41| I've spoken to Sheriff-Elect Tom Spangler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5201)|
| 1:26:45| and he also said that he came out and inspected it and looked at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5205)|
| 1:26:49| and said that he thought closing the road was going to cause more danger to the church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5209)|
| 1:26:52| and put the church in more liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5212)|
| 1:26:54| And so I'm willing to do what I need to do to keep the road open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5214)|
| 1:26:59| and the church is willing to do what it needs to do to keep the road open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5219)|
| 1:27:02| and the members in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5222)|
| 1:27:04| I've had people in the community tell me that they were willing to come out and help us clean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5224)|
| 1:27:07| and go out and find people with bobcats and equipment to help clean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5227)|
| 1:27:11| Like I said, my uncle works on equipment for a living,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5231)|
| 1:27:14| so he can go out and get equipment to go out and help clean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5234)|
| 1:27:18| Well, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5238)|
| 1:27:19| What, has the church been there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5239)|
| 1:27:21| I understood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5241)|
| 1:27:22| 140 years this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5242)|
| 1:27:23| 140 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5243)|
| 1:27:24| I hope it's there another 140 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5244)|
| 1:27:26| I do, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5246)|
| 1:27:27| But I don't want to be part of the situation which could cause it to fail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5247)|
| 1:27:33| I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5253)|
| 1:27:34| And if the county wants to come on and help us out, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5254)|
| 1:27:39| But I'm saying that the only way the county wants to help is by closing the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5259)|
| 1:27:44| then we'll take it on and the community and the church will take it on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5264)|
| 1:27:48| and just leave us alone is basically what I'm trying to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5268)|
| 1:27:52| is if the county wants to come and help, then fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5272)|
| 1:27:55| We more than welcome your help, but if you only want to help is by closing the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5275)|
| 1:28:01| then I ask you to leave the road open and we'll handle cleaning it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5281)|
| 1:28:05| I have a question for the law department, I guess, and codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5285)|
| 1:28:11| The only liability the church is actually exposing themselves to is the possibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5291)|
| 1:28:15| if they don't get the job completed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5295)|
| 1:28:18| that you all will come in and clean it up and put a lien on that $2,400 piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5298)|
| 1:28:23| Yes, sir, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5303)|
| 1:28:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5304)|
| 1:28:25| But, again, and the thing I wanted this commission to understand is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5305)|
| 1:28:29| the cost of the cleanup, at least where we are right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5309)|
| 1:28:32| substantially exceed the value of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5312)|
| 1:28:35| So we're very anxious not to take possession of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5315)|
| 1:28:40| We'll give the church the best possible start that we can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5320)|
| 1:28:45| and after that we'll help any way that we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5325)|
| 1:28:48| But as the pastor pointed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5328)|
| 1:28:50| 60 to 80 years of behavior is going to be a hard thing to correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5330)|
| 1:28:54| so I want everybody to approach this realistic expectations and eyes wide open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5334)|
| 1:29:00| You know, and I guess I want to speak for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5340)|
| 1:29:03| I'll let everybody else speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5343)|
| 1:29:05| I was wondering, I know that Dwight had offered maybe to leave the church in the best possible state that it could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5345)|
| 1:29:15| If the commission would help us to get it to where it needs to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5355)|
| 1:29:21| we would work to make sure it stays in that condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5361)|
| 1:29:26| I wondered, the fencing, does anybody on the commission or you, Dwight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5366)|
| 1:29:32| I think there's now a different type of fencing that might be more effective than what the fencing we have now that's up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5372)|
| 1:29:42| Would you all be willing to help us in finding the right type of fencing so that, as you said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5382)|
| 1:29:49| a person with a pickup can back up in 30 seconds, as you mentioned, and can be gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5389)|
| 1:29:53| Is there a certain type of fencing that could go back that would make it difficult?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5393)|
| 1:29:59| Okay, work with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5399)|
| 1:30:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5400)|
| 1:30:02| I think that would go a long way in helping to deter the dumping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5402)|
| 1:30:08| If you make it hard, it's like a criminal, the harder you make it to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5408)|
| 1:30:13| I think that would kindly help to alleviate some of the problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5413)|
| 1:30:19| If the commission would be willing to work with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5419)|
| 1:30:22| I think I had saw over at the city had put some type of a fence up that makes it a little bit more harder to dump and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5422)|
| 1:30:32| as far as throwing stuff over the fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5432)|
| 1:30:37| As I say, this is something, there's no guarantees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5437)|
| 1:30:41| Life has no guarantees, but I think that we can do better working together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5441)|
| 1:30:45| I think that we can do better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5445)|
| 1:30:47| I hope that we can work together to do better because I think once it gets back to a point where it's beautiful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5447)|
| 1:30:55| then people take ownership and you feel like you're a part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5455)|
| 1:31:01| I'm hopeful that maybe it will be a place that instead of saying, well, that's the old hopper and dump site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5461)|
| 1:31:07| somebody might say, hey, that's a beautiful, beautiful place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5467)|
| 1:31:10| It is a beautiful place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5470)|
| 1:31:11| Many of the people come from town and walk up to the towers, the communication towers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5471)|
| 1:31:16| If you haven't walked up to those towers, I'd invite you to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5476)|
| 1:31:19| It's about a two-and-a-half, three-mile walk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5479)|
| 1:31:22| There's no greater view in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5482)|
| 1:31:25| As you look back over to the arena and you look into Sevier County, there's no greater view anywhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5485)|
| 1:31:31| and the wind rushes up the mountains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5491)|
| 1:31:33| So I'm hopeful that that would be the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5493)|
| 1:31:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5496)|
| 1:31:37| We have on the floor right now a motion to postpone 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5497)|
| 1:31:42| I think 90 days will give the church time to find out about possession of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5502)|
| 1:31:47| Dwight, time to get them some information, and them time to come up with a cleanup plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5507)|
| 1:31:56| I know we have two commissioners with their lights still on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5516)|
| 1:31:59| I would ask if you all would be ready to go ahead and vote on that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5519)|
| 1:32:02| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5522)|
| 1:32:04| I have a question that Dwight mentioned in his initial statement about the county still assisting with the cleanup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5524)|
| 1:32:12| Did I understand that to be correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5532)|
| 1:32:14| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5534)|
| 1:32:15| I'd propose to the commission that we go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5535)|
| 1:32:16| We have our estimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5536)|
| 1:32:17| I'd propose to the commission that we just go ahead and complete and fund the cleanup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5537)|
| 1:32:21| I'd rather, if the church wants to look at their fencing options, we were prepared to incur this expense anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5541)|
| 1:32:27| I'd rather let the church put their resources towards fencing options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5547)|
| 1:32:32| Again, the right-of-way is limited edge-of-pavement to edge-of-pavement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5552)|
| 1:32:35| so the fence would be on property that either the church or the Howard Moran family owns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5555)|
| 1:32:41| but my intent would be for us to go ahead and simply complete the cleanup,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5561)|
| 1:32:45| and then we all have a good handle on what kind of condition the property is in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5565)|
| 1:32:49| reopen the road, and then go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5569)|
| 1:32:52| That's what I would like to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5572)|
| 1:32:54| I'm a little bit worried that if we spend the money on the cleanup, keep the road open, and get back there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5574)|
| 1:32:58| we're spending money again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5578)|
| 1:32:59| There are a lot of things in the 3rd District I'd like to be able to spend $115,000 on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5579)|
| 1:33:05| I would like to give the church a chance and perhaps give them some assistance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5585)|
| 1:33:09| but to just go and spend the money and then open the road back up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5589)|
| 1:33:13| we could be right back here in two or three years, according to your own testimony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5593)|
| 1:33:19| One of the things in the very beginning that I have been bothered with by this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5599)|
| 1:33:23| I think it's a very slippery slope we start down when we start to take away individual liberties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5603)|
| 1:33:28| because of the actions of others, and also the spending of public dollars on private property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5608)|
| 1:33:35| A couple of thoughts, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5615)|
| 1:33:38| No, that is a very real risk, and I hope I've alluded to it today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5618)|
| 1:33:42| and I know I've alluded to it in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5622)|
| 1:33:44| There is a risk, no matter who completes this cleanup, that if you clean the property up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5624)|
| 1:33:49| whether the church does it or we do it, no matter who does it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5629)|
| 1:33:52| there is a risk if you reopen the road that you will be back in this condition again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5632)|
| 1:33:57| I want to be clear and unambiguous about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5637)|
| 1:34:00| Just the sense I get from the body is a willingness to take that risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5640)|
| 1:34:04| The other thing is I would remind you that every single property owner post-closure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5644)|
| 1:34:12| continues to have access to their property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5652)|
| 1:34:15| and in fact the area that's proposed for closure would not be eligible for a driveway entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5655)|
| 1:34:21| So in terms of the particular parcel in question, there's no loss of access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5661)|
| 1:34:26| They might have to walk to it instead of drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5666)|
| 1:34:28| but the areas where they'd be able to drive to their property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5668)|
| 1:34:31| they'd continue to be able to drive to their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5671)|
| 1:34:33| So we've worked very hard to maintain everybody in the best possible state that we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5673)|
| 1:34:42| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5682)|
| 1:34:43| And not to delay this anymore, but I wanted to ask you, Commissioner, Chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5683)|
| 1:34:50| the quote that we have in terms of cleaning it up was close to 100,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5690)|
| 1:34:55| Is that correct or more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5695)|
| 1:34:57| So, Commissioner Smith, it seems like our body and all in the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5697)|
| 1:35:04| and with working with the church and all that everybody seems to be coming to the same decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5704)|
| 1:35:10| to talk about it and see what we can do best for this community, the church and county and everybody involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5710)|
| 1:35:17| So would it be to say, you know, half that amount?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5717)|
| 1:35:26| I mean, half of the cleanup?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5726)|
| 1:35:28| I mean, when you say to go ahead with the cleanup, I understand the white side and your side also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5728)|
| 1:35:34| Well, we have a motion on the floor to postpone 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5734)|
| 1:35:39| But he wasn't talking about, were you talking about going ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5739)|
| 1:35:42| and starting the cleanup within that 90 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5742)|
| 1:35:45| Well, that being said, we do have the $107,000 that we've got a question about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5745)|
| 1:35:54| What I'd ask is clear direction from the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5754)|
| 1:35:56| We could go ahead and initiate the cleanup based on a vote today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5756)|
| 1:36:00| and come back in 90 days and tell you what our results have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5760)|
| 1:36:04| We could take this 90 days and confer with the law director's office and the church and the property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5764)|
| 1:36:10| and then come back at the end of those 90 days with a consolidated single proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5770)|
| 1:36:15| and that may be a better option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5775)|
| 1:36:19| We can approach this any number of ways, but we would appreciate clear direction from the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5779)|
| 1:36:24| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5784)|
| 1:36:26| Thank you, and I'll be very quick because I feel like we're like the salesperson that got a yes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5786)|
| 1:36:30| but kept talking until he got a no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5790)|
| 1:36:34| I would like for maybe Dwight, people from the church, and Commissioner Daley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5794)|
| 1:36:40| to be involved in this next 90 days so that we're not just 90 days later saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5800)|
| 1:36:45| okay, what's going on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5805)|
| 1:36:47| That they're talking all the time and got some kind of consensus of what's going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5807)|
| 1:36:52| and instead of maybe two commissioners, just one so we're not doing sunshine stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5812)|
| 1:36:58| I would like that to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5818)|
| 1:37:01| This is more just for Dwight because I think we did it with Parks and Rec| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5821)|
| 1:37:04| when we had some people doing some illegal hunting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5824)|
| 1:37:07| We had some infrared cameras we put up someplace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5827)|
| 1:37:10| I can't believe in this day and age, if we're having a problem with people dumping trash off certain areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5830)|
| 1:37:17| that we couldn't have some kind of infrared cameras, battery-powered cameras,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5837)|
| 1:37:22| that we can put up temporarily until we find out who some of these people are and see what they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5842)|
| 1:37:27| I would just like for us to keep that in the back of our mind of ways we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5847)|
| 1:37:34| Yeah, I'm just trying to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5854)|
| 1:37:37| Are we going to defer it for 90 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5857)|
| 1:37:40| I mean, the motion being made, but are we going to start cleaning it up within that 90 days or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5860)|
| 1:37:46| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5866)|
| 1:37:47| We're not going to do anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5867)|
| 1:37:48| The motion is to defer 90 days so the church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5868)|
| 1:37:52| Mr. VanDeVate and the law department can come together with a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5872)|
| 1:37:57| No cleanup will start until the plan's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5877)|
| 1:37:59| The church has no right to negotiate right now because they don't own the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5879)|
| 1:38:03| They've got to get the property first, so that's going to take some time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5883)|
| 1:38:06| so let's vote on the motion to postpone for 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5886)|
| 1:38:10| Sir, call to question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5890)|
| 1:38:12| Yes, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5892)|
| 1:38:14| I see where you were coming, Commissioner Smith, about going ahead with the cleanup| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5894)|
| 1:38:20| and then not knowing if they're going to come right back and dump because the fence isn't up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5900)|
| 1:38:26| I think that if the county was willing to go and clean it up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5906)|
| 1:38:30| that within 90 days the church could come up with a fence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5910)|
| 1:38:33| and speak with several fencing companies and come up with a plan for the fencing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5913)|
| 1:38:39| so that the road didn't get opened back up until the fence was up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5919)|
| 1:38:45| Would that answer your question of cleaning it up and then opening the road back up without a fence up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5925)|
| 1:38:52| I can see your problem with that, and I think we could come up with getting the fence put up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5932)|
| 1:38:58| and in 90 days we could find the right kind of fence to go up, speak with some fencing contractors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5938)|
| 1:39:04| I've already been talking to some fencing contractors, and they've given me some ideas already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5944)|
| 1:39:12| We have a motion before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5952)|
| 1:39:16| It's been properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5956)|
| 1:39:19| The motion is to postpone for 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=5959)|

| 1:41:21| Do I have a motion? Do I have a second? Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=6081)|
| 1:41:26| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=6086)|
| 1:41:28| Thank you, Mr. Chair. I believe I expressed concern at the last meeting about representation not necessarily being assigned by district to the MPC, whereas Board of Education, Board of Zoning Appeals, County Commission all have representation kind of spread around the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=6088)|
| 1:41:53| We just flew through what really I maybe should have called as a stop sign on the motion right in front of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=6113)|
| 1:42:03| And I do not know in the Herb Anders replacement, which is for two years, anything other than what's in the short bio of the person that he's worked in real estate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=6123)|
| 1:42:25| I'm truly concerned that MPC representation is not spread around the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=6145)|
| 1:42:36| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=6156)|
| 1:42:38| I want to second that with Commissioner Wright that, like I said last week, the East District will be the next one to grow and them not having some representation on the MPC board I think would be a detriment to that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=6158)|
| 1:42:58| I have the lady, Janice Toker, who lives in South Knoxville. She's on the pulse of everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=6178)|
| 1:43:05| She's on MPC. As a matter of fact, she's the vice chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=6185)|
| 1:43:08| And it's easy to talk to her and she knows what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=6188)|
| 1:43:13| It would be hard not to have someone in the East District and not to have contact with the knowledge of the community itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=6193)|
| 1:43:24| So I agree with Mr. Wright totally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=6204)|
| 1:43:26| Mr. Law Director, what does the charter or the state statute say on this issue as far as how appointments work for MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=6206)|
| 1:43:34| There's no district representation required. It would be a policy of this commission, you do whatever you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=6214)|
| 1:43:50| But the nomination comes from the mayor's office and you either approve or disapprove.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=6230)|
| 1:43:56| I can see your all's point. I really can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=6236)|
| 1:44:00| But if you had, say you had five people from East Knox County that were on this commission, on the MPC, and all the developments going on in West Knoxville, how do you think those people would feel then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=6240)|
| 1:44:14| I think that if you're asking me personally what I think of that, that would be incorrect just as no representation in the East right now would be incorrect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=6254)|
| 1:44:26| And what has really happened is that there's been some considerable, I shouldn't say considerable, but there has been some restraint on residential development West.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=6266)|
| 1:44:40| But what is happening East currently has not been ag going residential. It's been ag going logistics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=6280)|
| 1:44:50| And if there's no representation or someone bringing that voice to MPC, then logistics would really continue to expand in East where acreage is available, whereas you can't expand West with logistics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=6290)|
| 1:45:07| Now, it does mean jobs, but still that's not what I'm bringing right at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=6307)|
| 1:45:14| What we're discussing right now at the moment is a voice in the East.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=6314)|
| 1:45:21| And really to hit on your point, Laura Cole, Rebecca Longmire, and Herb Anders do technically all sort of reside East, Northeast, Southeast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=6321)|
| 1:45:39| I'm just raising the point that I think in these two items, one which we've approved and one which the motion is to approve, need to be discussed, not turned down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=6339)|
| 1:45:54| But we need to know right now that I can't tell by looking at any of these replacements what flavor for their sentiment toward the portions of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=6354)|
| 1:46:07| Mr. Law Director, is there anything in the future we can do by way of ordinance or would it have to be a charter change to restructure how MPC appointments are placed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=6367)|
| 1:46:20| I believe it's statutory that the mayor appoints because this is the regional planning commission and it's established by state law and the appointment is by state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=6380)|
| 1:46:35| You can make a request from the appointing person to consider this particular issue, but as far as a legal action that you can take that would force it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=6395)|
| 1:46:51| the appointment is by the mayors of the respective participants in the regional planning commission by statute, which is outside your jurisdiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=6411)|
| 1:47:05| Yeah, there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=6425)|
| 1:47:13| I just wanted to recognize Jennifer Owen, who's standing back there, our Knox County School Board District 2 member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=6433)|
| 1:47:25| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=6445)|
| 1:47:28| When they were doing, I was on the board of directors for the Home Builders Association, and any time that it seemed like a position came up and it was in a different section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=6448)|
| 1:47:45| they would come to the home builders and ask, do you have somebody in that area that you could recommend?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=6465)|
| 1:47:53| I was recommended at one time, there was a guy on there, his last name was Whittaker, and he was going off in the Halls Powell area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=6473)|
| 1:48:03| They got me because I lived out there and wanted to know if I would serve on the MPC, but it was always looked at equal representation through the mayor's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=6483)|
| 1:48:12| and each one of those was appointed that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=6492)|
| 1:48:16| It was sort of like a, I hate to say it, a gentleman's agreement, but an agreement that said that each of these areas would be equally represented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=6496)|
| 1:48:30| But there's no statute when it was becoming a regional that has forced us into some situations that we shouldn't be in, but anyway, that's the way it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=6510)|
| 1:48:40| So it's the mayor's prerogative to suggest and appoint and go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=6520)|
| 1:48:48| Commissioner Nystrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=6528)|
| 1:48:50| Thank you. I even, after hearing Commissioner Wright bring that up last week, I even pulled out my handy copy of the charter just to verify, I think it's section 3, number H in the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=6530)|
| 1:49:01| However, but I also recall, I think when I was appointing someone to BZA, or someone had reached out to me on BZA, that I verified and looked at someone that we could appoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=6541)|
| 1:49:14| and I wonder if as a best practice moving forward with the soon to have a new mayor's administration, if this is one of those things that in the long run, it does make sense to try to have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=6554)|
| 1:49:28| granted, we're never going to get this perfect because of the nature of it, but it does make sense moving forward with the new administration to put some intentionality behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=6568)|
| 1:49:39| And like I said, it's a state law, I don't know, state law is going to beat, is going to trump what we would try to do here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=6579)|
| 1:49:47| but I guess there's got to be some intentionality behind trying to get these appointments maybe a little bit more spread out moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=6587)|
| 1:49:55| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=6595)|
| 1:49:56| Yes, thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=6596)|
| 1:49:59| So, continuing on that for just a moment, Commissioner Bustler is saying we have a gentleman's agreement, so to speak, that representation be spread around the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=6599)|
| 1:50:09| I guess it's best that we understand where we started with this is that we, sitting as commission since 1955 or whenever, have made the policy of how zoning is to take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=6609)|
| 1:50:26| In other words, the ordinances, the regulations, the rule book is written by county commission for those unincorporated portions of Knox County as to how we want zoning to take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=6626)|
| 1:50:40| And we then, by state law, are directed to have a planning organization, and they take that planning task over for us and the staff looks at what the regulations are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=6640)|
| 1:50:55| make a recommendation, the citizen part of it votes on that, and when we receive it here at commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=6655)|
| 1:51:03| most of the time we find it to be, we should find it to be in compliance with the rules that we've made for what we would like to see the planning in Knox County follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=6663)|
| 1:51:16| That's the only reason I raise the question is that the person that's being appointed, which is the right of the mayor, for us to then approve, is a person that the only thing I find on his resume is he's in real estate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=6676)|
| 1:51:35| Thank you, Mr. Chair, and I'm prepared for us to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=6695)|
| 1:51:43| We have a motion to approve before us that's been properly seconded. All in favor say aye. Aye. Opposed say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=6703)|
| 1:51:53| Roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=6713)|
| 1:51:57| Start in the 11th and go backwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=6717)|
| 1:52:03| Commissioner Brantley? No. Commissioner Brantley votes no. Commissioner Thomas? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=6723)|
| 1:52:09| Commissioner Thomas votes aye. Commissioner Daly? No. Commissioner Daly votes no. Commissioner Wright? No. Commissioner Wright votes no. Commissioner Bessler? Aye. Commissioner Bessler votes aye. Commissioner Anders? Aye. Commissioner Anders votes aye. Commissioner Schoonmaker? No. Commissioner Schoonmaker votes no. Commissioner Nystrom? Aye.

| 1:52:39| Carringer? Aye. Commissioner Carringer votes aye. Commissioner Gill? Aye. Commissioner Gill votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=6759)|
| 1:52:49| Does anyone wish to change their vote? By a vote of 7 to 4, the motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=6769)|
| 1:53:00| Resolution 702 has been added approving a memorandum of understanding with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=6780)|
| 1:53:06| Jungle Float Knoxville to permit Jungle Float Knoxville's use of the parking lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=6786)|
| 1:53:10| at Concord Park at a rate of $100 per month. Do I have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=6790)|
| 1:53:25| I'd like to have some discussion but I'm sitting here not for it. I'll make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=6805)|
| 1:53:32| I'll second it so we can discuss it. Okay. Your lights on. Brad, you want to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=6812)|
| 1:53:37| Yes, sir. Mr. Patel, number one, I hate getting something on Monday that we need to vote on on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=6817)|
| 1:53:45| Monday. Number two, why are we bringing an MOU for a private business to do public work on a public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=6825)|
| 1:53:52| park just to rent little parking spaces? I understand it. I know exactly what it is. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=6832)|
| 1:53:56| saw it at Nautical Boat Club. It's a great concept. We're opening up all public land for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=6836)|
| 1:54:04| commercial use at this point? No, sir. Again, I apologize for being this late. I just didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=6844)|
| 1:54:09| want to wait another month to get resolution of this issue. This concept was brought to us a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=6849)|
| 1:54:13| couple months ago by the owner and I had sent it up to the law department for review. Unfortunately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=6853)|
| 1:54:19| before the law department was able to complete the review, the operation went ahead and started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=6859)|
| 1:54:24| I got calls the first of the month that they were out there operating, which may not have been a big| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=6864)|
| 1:54:28| deal because they're out in the water. Obviously, we do not control what happens in the water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=6868)|
| 1:54:32| itself. That's TVA or TWRA. We got calls about use of Rocky Point within Concord Park, parking there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=6872)|
| 1:54:41| and folks swimming out to this operation. I contacted the law department and purchasing to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=6881)|
| 1:54:47| say, what do we need to do with this? Where do we need to head? We looked at some different options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=6887)|
| 1:54:52| The MOU appears to be the solution if we want to allow them to continue. Typically, we would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=6892)|
| 1:54:58| done a bid process on this, but again, the way this has come about, we're just trying to figure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=6898)|
| 1:55:02| out what to do with it now. My fear is that we open up publicly owned land for public access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=6902)|
| 1:55:08| I don't know that TVA would allow us to lease. This is TVA acquired property, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=6908)|
| 1:55:14| Correct. We do have other leased operations, but again, typically we'll go through a better process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=6914)|
| 1:55:18| River Sports, Concord Marina, those are all leased operations for providing recreation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=6918)|
| 1:55:24| services. This is certainly similar to that, but a little different bird, too, in that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=6924)|
| 1:55:29| operation's in the water and they just want to use the park as a parking area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=6929)|
| 1:55:34| They're under contract. I guess they lease space, Nautical Boat Club leases space at Concord| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=6934)|
| 1:55:40| Marina. They pay rent over there. For them to use it over there, I don't think we have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=6940)|
| 1:55:46| question because there's, number one, plenty of parking, and number two, it's a commercial area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=6946)|
| 1:55:50| Correct. I'll be voting no just because we didn't go through the proper process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=6950)|
| 1:55:56| Commissioner Besseler. Thank you, Mr. Chair. When an operation starts like this without a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=6956)|
| 1:56:03| agreement with the county, how much liability was the county looking at, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=6963)|
| 1:56:09| I couldn't hear you. I said the liability on using this without.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=6969)|
| 1:56:13| Well, currently what they're looking at is using the parking lot, so the liability would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=6973)|
| 1:56:19| limited to the parking lot. Once they get out into the river, that's another jurisdiction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=6979)|
| 1:56:25| altogether. So it's just we would have the same liability as anybody else using the parking lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=6985)|
| 1:56:31| within the confines of our parks, but in this case we may have somebody to fall back on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=6991)|
| 1:56:43| if we do get sued as a second party, but they're bringing in other people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7003)|
| 1:56:48| you know, it'll increase our exposure. So did TVA approve that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7008)|
| 1:56:57| TVA has given us the land to use for the public use. As long as we are using it for parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7017)|
| 1:57:03| recreation, and public use, I think we have a flexibility for the policies of this county to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7023)|
| 1:57:10| be able to go about how we do it, just like we use the marinas, just like we use the yacht club,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7030)|
| 1:57:16| just like we have the restaurants, other things that we have there that are quasi or commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7036)|
| 1:57:22| properties on public lands for public use type things. Oh no, let me clarify that. Did TVA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7042)|
| 1:57:30| the picture that's up there, did they approve that type of boat or whatever it is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7050)|
| 1:57:38| Whatever they use in the water would have to be approved by 26A permits or TWRA permits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7058)|
| 1:57:45| but Knox County wouldn't have any jurisdiction over that, and I would have no reason to even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7065)|
| 1:57:50| ask if they had it or not. That would be between them and the party with the jurisdiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7070)|
| 1:57:57| I just, what I was going to say is, okay, we do the parking lot. TVA has the approval of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7077)|
| 1:58:05| structure, whatever it is out there, and I don't want somebody to think that we have liability on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7085)|
| 1:58:11| that structure, too, if somebody got hurt on it. Mr. Schoonmaker. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Battelle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7091)|
| 1:58:19| this is located at Rocky Point Park, which for people in the audience may not understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7099)|
| 1:58:24| where this is, but the park's location from the Concord Road roundabout, it's about a quarter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7104)|
| 1:58:31| of a mile due east on North Shore Drive of the roundabout. It's my understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7111)|
| 1:58:38| could you put the video back up, because this might make sense a little bit more here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7118)|
| 1:58:45| and enlarge it. You'll see the gentleman in the green shirt and the hat. He resides in the chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7125)|
| 1:58:50| behind him, and he has an iPad and a cell phone, and he takes payments there, and you can see the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7130)|
| 1:58:55| young lady now has been outfitted with a vest, and she's going to go down into the water and swim to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7135)|
| 1:59:00| this structure about 100 feet offshore. It's my understanding that this is actually a no-swim park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7140)|
| 1:59:07| is that correct? That is correct, and obviously that is our big concern here, both with parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7147)|
| 1:59:11| on the grass as a long-term maintenance issue, and again, I think if the county grants permission for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7151)|
| 1:59:16| this access, within the MOU right now, we have that no swimming would be allowed to the platform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7156)|
| 1:59:24| Well, and as Commissioner Anders said, this is more, this whatever structure is moored at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7164)|
| 1:59:31| lake shore, or I mean at the Concord Park, and of course it was originally designed to go out from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7171)|
| 1:59:38| where the boats are housed, and to use it for birthday parties and things, but as you can see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7178)|
| 1:59:45| they've set up operations, the cars are parked all over the grass. I can imagine what the litter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7185)|
| 1:59:53| is going to be after all of these people, extra people here, but I am absolutely against this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7193)|
| 1:59:59| and to think that we would want to charge to run a commercial operation out of our county park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7199)|
| 2:00:06| a fee of only a hundred dollars a month, is just absolutely phenomenal to me, that we'd even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7206)|
| 2:00:12| consider something like this. You know, if you want to use your parks for commercial businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7212)|
| 2:00:17| then we need to go through the procurement department and do an RFP on this type of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7217)|
| 2:00:22| operation, but this is wrong for West Knox County, and I've had complaints from residents who live in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7222)|
| 2:00:30| the houses across from the water over there already. Commissioner Thomas. Hey, thanks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7230)|
| 2:00:37| Mr. Chairman. Okay, I'm on the other side of this a little bit. I think about, you go to the beach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7237)|
| 2:00:42| and you go to the beach, and wherever, Merle Beach, and they, people going up and down the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7242)|
| 2:00:46| beach saying, hey, you want to do the sea do, you want to do something, various activity on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7246)|
| 2:00:51| beach, and I, to me, this kind of just adds to the park there if it's something people can enjoy. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7251)|
| 2:00:57| mean, how much money can they really make off this over a couple of months? I was there at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7257)|
| 2:01:03| ribbon-cutting. I thought it was a pretty cool thing, and I thought they were just going to rent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7263)|
| 2:01:06| it out for birthday parties, but honestly, I think it's kind of interesting that somebody would think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7266)|
| 2:01:14| that they can enhance that park, and I really don't have a problem with that. If they can make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7274)|
| 2:01:20| it work, I don't see how it's going to fill up the parking lot. There's not that many people that can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7280)|
| 2:01:24| use it at one time, so, and plus, it's out in the lake. I don't, we don't have a liability out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7284)|
| 2:01:30| so that's kind of where I'm coming from. I think it's adding to the park. Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7290)|
| 2:01:37| Thank you. I agree with Commissioner Anders and Commissioner Schoonmaker. I hate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7297)|
| 2:01:45| four o'clock resolutions that are put on the agenda, and I've made the statement that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7305)|
| 2:01:51| I'll make a statement again, if one comes in the ninth district, I'll make a motion to postpone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7311)|
| 2:01:54| for 30 days because this right here seems to be $100. That's not, you know, for use of our parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7314)|
| 2:02:03| you know, and the gentleman sitting there in the chair and using his phone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7323)|
| 2:02:08| Doug, you just don't seem right. I mean, that's just, I'm sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7328)|
| 2:02:11| I don't feel good about it, and I'm not going to be voting for it. Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7331)|
| 2:02:23| I'm an innocent bystander there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7343)|
| 2:02:25| Thank you, Chairman. Okay, if this is a no-swim area, how do we bypass a no-swim area when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7345)|
| 2:02:39| they're putting a life jacket on and swimming out to this? So, how do we, if that's no-swim area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7359)|
| 2:02:49| how are we able to allow that? Because that's a, you don't have any jurisdiction on the water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7369)|
| 2:02:54| Yeah, there's no swimming from the bank, but out on the water, we don't have any jurisdiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7374)|
| 2:03:00| So, TVA, TWRA, we're the ones that would have to come in on that, correct? Correct. So, that, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7380)|
| 2:03:09| Commissioner Neister, is that it, Michelle? Well, I kind of, I guess, had a question on that. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7389)|
| 2:03:13| it's a no-swim park. So, we say, well, it's a no-swim park, but the moment someone actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7393)|
| 2:03:17| leaves shore and is in the water, they're swimming. Or they jump off the top of the trampoline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7397)|
| 2:03:22| Yeah, so we have no jurisdiction to enforce the no-swim in the moment they get off-landed in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7402)|
| 2:03:27| water. You mentioned it, now, is this anchored primarily out of Concord Marina, out at Darby's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7407)|
| 2:03:33| Marina out there? Yes, it is, and they move it in and out then. So, they brought it over there. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7413)|
| 2:03:38| that's about, and is that, is the main access point from this park or is it moved to other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7418)|
| 2:03:44| locations? No, this is the main one right now. We've actually looked at whether it's an idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7424)|
| 2:03:49| to put it somewhere else. Even at the Cove, although we get crowded, we have more parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7429)|
| 2:03:53| there, but they tell me it's not deep enough. And, Commissioners, too, this is certainly not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7433)|
| 2:03:58| my idea. I'm trying to figure out a resolution here. I talk with Purchasing about how to put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7438)|
| 2:04:02| this MOU together. The $100 was just an idea to get this thing through. If we wanted to try it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7442)|
| 2:04:07| for a summer and see how it worked and reevaluate at the end of summer, it was an option to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7447)|
| 2:04:13| That is all. You know, again, at this point, we're just trying to get direction on whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7453)|
| 2:04:17| the Commission would support continuing this or, like I say, if not, we can tell them they need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7457)|
| 2:04:22| go elsewhere. Well, I've got the floor. If I'm a resident and I'm a kid, yes, it looks like a whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7462)|
| 2:04:27| lot of fun. It looks like something that I'd love to do. I'd love to have a birthday party there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7467)|
| 2:04:31| Do you know if, from the Concord Marina, have they ever tried to do a shuttle out to it or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7471)|
| 2:04:39| boat kids out? Is that something that was ever discussed? Is that, you know, if we've got an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7479)|
| 2:04:43| issue with access at this point, if he was a commercial provider out of Concord Marina,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7483)|
| 2:04:50| running a shuttle out to it, if it's out towards the middle, that kind of makes sense, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7490)|
| 2:04:55| That made sense to me, too, and I asked that question. Their thought was having, in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7495)|
| 2:05:00| location, there's a lot of kids that go out to this. Parents do not go. They want it in a location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7500)|
| 2:05:05| where the parents could watch from the shore, and I think next to the marina, you're probably on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7505)|
| 2:05:09| navigation channel there to where you'd have to probably move it way out to make it operable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7509)|
| 2:05:14| within TVA's limits. And again, if it's the Commission's pleasure to allow this, what they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7514)|
| 2:05:20| could do is shuttle, you know, some sort of boat or raft back and forth and not have people swim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7520)|
| 2:05:26| My concern would be, you know, if we authorize this, it is a no-swimming area, I don't feel it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7526)|
| 2:05:31| would be safe for kids to swim out there. I think they would have to provide a shuttle to do this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7531)|
| 2:05:34| operation. My concern with this is, are we opening ourselves up to say, Hugh wants to start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7534)|
| 2:05:40| renting jet skis down off of the Cove and ask to use our parking. How much parking do we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7540)|
| 2:05:46| available at this site, and does this use, commercial use, the parking and the thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7546)|
| 2:05:53| itself, interfere with the use of the park by other citizens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7553)|
| 2:05:59| Yeah, I had a couple more things. One, where's the $100, what are we going to, if we did okay this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7559)|
| 2:06:11| where's the $100 going to go, what kind of fund or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7571)|
| 2:06:14| Probably just as a general fund to where our fees are collected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7574)|
| 2:06:18| Okay, well, that's, I mean, that's like a penny or something, $100. But then I go back to the point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7578)|
| 2:06:26| that, okay, it's a no-swim, which we don't, we don't have any right over that, but if we okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7586)|
| 2:06:32| them to use our parking lot, and we're okaying them to use the property to set up there and put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7592)|
| 2:06:38| the life jackets on, and we know they're going out into the water, legally, you know, does that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7598)|
| 2:06:46| that still, I feel like, brings us into if there's ever a lawsuit, because we have okayed this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7606)|
| 2:06:53| business to do that. And then I just, I'm all about swimming, I'm all about water, anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7613)|
| 2:07:00| adventurous you can do, count me in right there. But, and we're, we're boaters, but it horrifies me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7620)|
| 2:07:08| to think that parents would let their kids go out on something like this in the middle of the lake,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7628)|
| 2:07:14| and, and I mean, the lake is one of those where everybody wears a life jacket in my boat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7634)|
| 2:07:19| I don't care how good a swimmer you are, so I just feel like that's letting us, I think that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7639)|
| 2:07:25| putting the county at too much risk to let a personal business do that. We've got to go into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7645)|
| 2:07:33| zoning here in about four minutes, so I'm going to put this meeting into recess. You got, you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7653)|
| 2:07:39| a motion on the floor, you got to get rid of that motion, don't we? Okay. Our choices are we can go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7659)|
| 2:07:45| ahead and vote on this, or someone can make a substitute motion that we hear this when we come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7665)|
| 2:07:50| back out of recess. I don't, I don't know what the comments are, the voting shouldn't take too much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7670)|
| 2:07:56| but. Yeah. Do your comment real quick. I just had a quick question, because this was presented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7676)|
| 2:08:03| today, does the language reflect, Doug, if they have to have a boat at the shore to ferry kids out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7683)|
| 2:08:11| to the apparatus that's in the middle? Yes, ma'am, because that was one of my concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7691)|
| 2:08:15| the law department did address that. Item number six, implementing an appropriate safe shuttle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7695)|
| 2:08:19| method to transport customers from shore to the water park. And who set the $100 rate? Again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7699)|
| 2:08:25| Matt Myers and I discussed that, the commission certainly changed that too, it was, yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7705)|
| 2:08:31| we had no good idea what to charge in a case like this. Thank you. Well, I was just going to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7711)|
| 2:08:38| one other point, that apparently on Sunday when we had the storms go through, that the moorings on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7718)|
| 2:08:43| that broke free and ended up into the cove, into the park to the right, because they couldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7723)|
| 2:08:51| secure it properly. So, you know, with kids on something like that, and you can't even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7731)|
| 2:08:57| operate it safely, this is just the wrong thing for us to start in our Knox County parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7737)|
| 2:09:04| Okay, we have no more discussion, we have a motion before us to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7744)|
| 2:09:12| Yeah, I had to make, you got to make a positive motion, so no, no, no denies it. Yes, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7752)|
| 2:09:20| The motion is to approve. All in favor say aye. Aye. Those opposed say no. No. Let's do a roll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7760)|
| 2:09:28| call vote, starting the first district. Pretty close. Commissioner Gill. Yes. Commissioner Gill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7768)|
| 2:09:35| votes aye. Commissioner Carringer. No. Commissioner Carringer votes no. Commissioner Smith. No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7775)|
| 2:09:40| Commissioner Smith votes no. Commissioner Nystrom. No. Commissioner Nystrom votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7780)|

| 2:09:51| Anders. No. Commissioner Anders votes no. Commissioner Bussler. No. Commissioner Bussler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7791)|
| 2:09:56| votes no. Commissioner Wright. No. Commissioner Wright votes no. Commissioner Daly. No. Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7796)|
| 2:10:01| Daly votes no. Commissioner Thomas. Aye. Commissioner Thomas votes aye. Commissioner Brantley. No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7801)|
| 2:10:07| Commissioner Brantley votes no. It fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7807)|
| 2:10:15| The motion fails 2 to 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7815)|
| 2:10:17| We're going to recess and resume this meeting with the discussion items after zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7817)|
| 2:10:28| We are going to recess for 10 minutes and then start zoning at 7 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7828)|
| 2:10:39| I call to order this June meeting of the Knox County Board of Zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7839)|
| 2:10:42| Madam Clerk, will you please call the roll. Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7842)|
| 2:10:47| Commissioner Carringer. Here. Commissioner Smith. Here. Commissioner Nystrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7847)|

| 2:11:04| 10 members present. Thank you, Madam Clerk. We have a very busy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7864)|
| 2:11:09| agenda tonight. Madam Clerk, would you please read the rules as far as time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7869)|
| 2:11:13| Rule 7, rezoning requests and appeals. Section A, time limits. The applicant for zoning and those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7873)|
| 2:11:19| opposed to the zoning shall be given a maximum of five minutes to present their case and three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7879)|
| 2:11:24| minutes for rebuttal. The chair shall have the discretion to grant an extension pursuant to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7884)|
| 2:11:28| approval of the commission by voice vote. If an extension is granted, each will be given an equal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7888)|
| 2:11:33| specified amount of time. Time will be kept by the clerk. Okay, in the past I have been very liberal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7893)|
| 2:11:40| In the past I have been very liberal in giving people the ability and right to speak, but with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7900)|
| 2:11:45| so many controversial items on the agenda, I am going to ask commissioners to vote on a proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7905)|
| 2:11:52| and that is each side be limited to three speakers for a total of 15 minutes each. And then if we get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7912)|
| 2:12:00| to that point, we can vote to extend. You want to go ahead and give your rebuttal times as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7920)|
| 2:12:04| or are you going to leave it all at 15 minutes? We'll give the three minutes for each side for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7924)|
| 2:12:09| rebuttal. All right. So clarify that's 15 minutes total and that includes the rebuttal time or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7929)|
| 2:12:17| It's 15 minutes plus a three minute rebuttal time. All right, each side and we still have the option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7937)|
| 2:12:22| if somebody feels they don't have all their answers to vote to extend the time to either side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7942)|
| 2:12:28| or both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7948)|
| 2:12:33| I would need a motion to do that. I'll make a motion to approve the chair's organization for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7953)|
| 2:12:41| this meeting. I don't think you need to vote on that. That's your discretion and that's your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7961)|
| 2:12:48| chair's discretion. You're the leader. I think it's a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7968)|
| 2:12:53| Well, I was looking for his confirmation from my colleagues on commission, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7973)|
| 2:12:59| Typically we do that with a vote. Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7979)|
| 2:13:08| Yes, sir. I'm Bill Petty, attorney. I represent the people, some people here. Hold on, sir. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7988)|
| 2:13:15| haven't even gotten to the agenda yet. I know you haven't. On what you're requesting of talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=7995)|
| 2:13:20| restricting, I would request that you let us have five people with five minutes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8000)|
| 2:13:27| A lot of people have come here tonight on this particular issue and I respectfully ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8007)|
| 2:13:31| that you do that. Okay, well it looks like we are going to vote on something then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8011)|
| 2:13:36| 15 minutes is 15 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8016)|
| 2:13:41| With three minutes each? If 15 minutes can, would that work for you all? You can have five people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8021)|
| 2:13:47| but still limit you to 15 minutes? It's not set in stone. It's to try to stop repeating what we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8027)|
| 2:13:56| keep hearing the same time and time again. If it gets to that, I'll shut it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8036)|
| 2:14:03| You're getting paid by the hour. I kind of doubt that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8043)|
| 2:14:06| What can I say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8046)|
| 2:14:15| Let's kind of play it by ear. If you don't mind, I would respectfully ask that you do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8055)|
| 2:14:20| Which item are you here on, sir? It's the, for instance, the third item down. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8060)|
| 2:14:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8065)|
| 2:14:29| Fresenius, your honor. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8069)|
| 2:14:37| Madam Clerk, first item. 5C18RZ, a request of William A. Smith for rezoning from A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8077)|
| 2:14:43| Agricultural, to RA, Low Density Residential. Property located north side of Greenwell Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8083)|
| 2:14:48| east side of Pettigo Road, Commission District 7. Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8088)|
| 2:14:53| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8093)|
| 2:14:59| May we get the report from the MPC staff? Mr. Chair, members of the Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8099)|
| 2:15:03| the Metropolitan Planning Commission recommended 14-0 on their consent agenda that the request of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8103)|
| 2:15:09| rezoning be approved. The Commission found that the rezoning would be consistent with the sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8109)|
| 2:15:14| plan and would allow development of the property in compliance and compatible with the surrounding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8114)|
| 2:15:20| property. It would allow the subdivision of the property and the lot to 10,000 square feet rather| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8120)|
| 2:15:25| than the one acre required by the zoning. Would the applicant wish to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8125)|
| 2:15:34| Commissioner Busler. I will make a recommendation that we go with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8134)|
| 2:15:38| MPC recommendation and rezone this. Second. Okay. We have a proper motion to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8138)|
| 2:15:45| for MPC recommendation and a second. All in favor say aye. Opposed say no. The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8145)|

| 2:16:03| District 4. Is the applicant present? Is there any opposition? May we have the report from the MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8163)|
| 2:16:13| staff? Mr. Chair, members of the Commission, the Metropolitan Planning Commission recommended 14-0| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8173)|
| 2:16:18| on the consent agenda that the Commission approve the rezoning request. The Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8178)|
| 2:16:22| found the request to be compatible with the sector plan, would allow extension of the existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8182)|
| 2:16:27| zoning from the north and east, and would allow development of the property compatible with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8187)|
| 2:16:33| surrounding property development. Commissioner Nystrom. Mr. Chairman, I'd like to make a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8193)|
| 2:16:41| recommendation that we approve this per MPC recommendation. Second. Okay. Is there any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8201)|
| 2:16:46| discussion? Seeing none, we have a motion before us to approve per MPC recommendation and a proper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8206)|
| 2:16:52| second. All in favor say aye. Opposed say no. And the motion carries. Madam Clerk, next item please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8212)|
| 2:16:59| 5B18SP, requested for Census USD Manufacturing Incorporated for an east county sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8219)|
| 2:17:07| amendment from LDR Low Density Residential to GC General Commercial Property located east side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8227)|
| 2:17:13| of East Governor John Sevier Highway, north of Hammer Road, Commission District 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8233)|
| 2:17:21| Is the applicant present? Mr. Chairman, Arthur Seymour, Jr., 550 West Main Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8241)|
| 2:17:29| I am here on behalf of the applicant. Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8249)|
| 2:17:38| Okay. May we get the report from the MPC staff? Thank you, Mr. Chair, Members of the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8258)|
| 2:17:44| The Metropolitan Planning Commission voted 8 to 6 to recommend that the Commission approve the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8264)|
| 2:17:50| sector plan change designation from Low Density Residential to General Commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8270)|
| 2:17:55| The Planning Commission's recommendation was driven by the changing conditions in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8275)|
| 2:18:00| primarily the demand for more light industrial uses. The property requested for the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8280)|
| 2:18:06| designation exhibits the characteristics of a good industrial site, having access to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8286)|
| 2:18:12| transportation, reasonable topography, and access to utilities. The site is accessed by East Governor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8292)|
| 2:18:21| John Sevier Highway and is within two miles of an interstate interchange. Amending the sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8301)|
| 2:18:26| plan designation would provide opportunities for the continued growth of Knox County's economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8306)|
| 2:18:31| Okay. Would the applicant wish to speak first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8311)|
| 2:18:38| If I may, and I assume our 15 minutes will go both towards the sector plan and the zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8318)|
| 2:18:45| address both of them together? No, these are two different votes, so it will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8325)|
| 2:18:52| All right, we'll be happy to, but I'm going to probably address not only the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8332)|
| 2:18:59| but the zoning in our initial remarks, if that's okay. Okay. I'm here on behalf of Fresenius,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8339)|
| 2:19:07| which has a manufacturing plant that is just starting up in the Forks of the River| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8347)|
| 2:19:13| on National Drive in Knox County. I have here with me other people who will speak, Dusty Irwin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8353)|
| 2:19:24| who is here. Many of you all have met. Alicia McCauley with Michael Brady and Company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8364)|
| 2:19:32| We also have David Weaver, who works out of the Ogden, Utah facility. Archie Spicer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8372)|
| 2:19:41| yeah, who is here with Fresenius. We have also the property owners and some other supporters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8381)|
| 2:19:49| of the project. We are initially asking for a sector plan for 50 acres of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8389)|
| 2:19:58| that is off John Sevier, bounded by Interstate 40 and Roscoe Lane. It does not adjoin Hammer Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8398)|
| 2:20:11| The owners, the Sherrids and the Bells, will continue to own property on Hammer Road and will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8411)|
| 2:20:17| continue to live there. We are asking for approval of the MPC recommendation on the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8417)|
| 2:20:27| and the zoning. The sector plan to general commercial, as Mr. Green just explained,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8427)|
| 2:20:33| and the zoning to plan commercial, which requires a use on review. In other words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8433)|
| 2:20:40| if you all approve the sector plan and the zoning tonight, Fresenius will be going back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8440)|
| 2:20:47| to the Metropolitan Planning Commission for site plan review, detailed issues regarding noise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8447)|
| 2:20:56| lighting, and barriers and buffering from surrounding property owners. What Fresenius| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8456)|
| 2:21:05| is asking for is to allow them to open a warehouse facility. Fresenius likes Knoxville and Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8465)|
| 2:21:14| County. It already has, as I mentioned, a manufacturing plan here with about 150 people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8474)|
| 2:21:22| employed. If the warehouse is approved, the manufacturing will expand and the warehouse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8482)|
| 2:21:32| will be serving a good part of the eastern United States. Fresenius makes dialysis products.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8492)|
| 2:21:42| Fortunately, some of you all were able to go through the plan. You can see that the type of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8502)|
| 2:21:49| work they do, the type of housekeeping they have, the type of security, because they are a FDA-regulated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8509)|
| 2:21:57| facility and require that a certain level of security and cleanliness and so forth be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8517)|
| 2:22:07| The key to the growth of the manufacturing plant here in Knox County is the development of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8527)|
| 2:22:13| warehouse facility. If we obtain approval of the warehouse facility, the plant will expand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8533)|
| 2:22:24| Product will come from the plant on National Drive to this warehouse facility. Some of it cannot be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8544)|
| 2:22:32| distributed immediately but must be held for 14 days or more. At the end of that period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8552)|
| 2:22:42| the product will be distributed throughout the eastern United States and actually can go well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8562)|
| 2:22:48| beyond that. Product will come from the plant in tractor-trailer trucks and will be deposited at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8568)|
| 2:22:58| the warehouse. There has been some discussion about where the truck entrance would be and we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8578)|
| 2:23:07| in discussion with MPC. They want a new entrance to the property off John Sevier. We would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8587)|
| 2:23:14| the employees come off Roscoe Lane, which would require improvements to Roscoe Lane, but no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8594)|
| 2:23:23| access will be off Hammer Road because this property simply does not have access off of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8603)|
| 2:23:31| Hammer Road. You all have a balancing act and I told MPC this. We need homeowners in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8611)|
| 2:23:41| Most of the people here are homeowners. I know I am. A lot of our people are, but we need jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8621)|
| 2:23:50| and business. Knox County is in a fortunate position with Presenius. This is a business that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8630)|
| 2:23:58| is high-tech, uses robotics, employs a number, will employ a number of people if this warehouse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8638)|
| 2:24:07| is approved, and will pay very high wages. We're talking people that can make up to $60,000 to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8647)|
| 2:24:17| $80,000 a year working on the factory floor. Now the issues are how do we protect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8657)|
| 2:24:25| neighboring properties? The complaints we have heard are noise, light, and visibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8665)|
| 2:24:33| Ms. McCauley from Michael Brady will address those issues in a moment, but Michael Brady| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8673)|
| 2:24:39| has been working on this project for some time and they have worked mightily and I think have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8679)|
| 2:24:47| come up with a good plan to address all of those issues, but those will all go back before MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8687)|
| 2:24:58| and are in the process. A lot of it has been submitted to MPC for their review and will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8698)|
| 2:25:07| heard at a public meeting where there will be public input and we will have to address those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8707)|
| 2:25:14| issues. We are here tonight and I am going to turn it over to Mr. Irwin who is very familiar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8714)|
| 2:25:22| with the plan and ask you all to approve the amendment to the sector plan to general commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8722)|
| 2:25:31| Thank you. Sir, if you would please give your name and address for the record. I will. My name is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8731)|
| 2:25:36| Dusty Irwin. I live at 460 Lou Allen Hollow Lane in Clinton, Tennessee. I am the senior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8736)|
| 2:25:43| manufacturing director of Fresenius Medical Care in Knoxville, Tennessee. I want to first begin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8743)|
| 2:25:50| thanking you Mr. Chairman and those of the commission that were able to take time out of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8750)|
| 2:25:55| their busy lives to come and visit our facility. We were grateful for an opportunity to show and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8755)|
| 2:26:01| share with you the products and services that we provide to customers, to patients all around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8761)|
| 2:26:08| the nation and the world and also look at the amazing progress in the programs that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8768)|
| 2:26:14| Fresenius proposes to put forward in the future as well as the work that has been currently done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8774)|
| 2:26:21| in the last few years. I would like to speak if I could to the why Fresenius needs this warehouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8781)|
| 2:26:32| By the way, I'd like to also thank the good people from the community that came| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8792)|
| 2:26:38| by on Saturday. We housed some 25 of them, came to the plant and we spent several hours discussing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8798)|
| 2:26:46| and showing some of them the facility and hearing their issues too. Fresenius needs this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8806)|
| 2:26:54| warehouse. It's predominantly a warehouse from my view. I'm the manufacturing arm of the company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8814)|
| 2:26:59| but in order for us to be successful we have to have a place to secure securely and quietly hold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8819)|
| 2:27:06| this product until we can release it. It's a point to make is that this is a highly secured,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8826)|
| 2:27:13| private, pharmaceutical warehouse that we ship product from. To a clear distinction, almost half| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8833)|
| 2:27:22| of it is used specifically to hold our product until we can release it. Some of the product is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8842)|
| 2:27:28| actually held for reasons of security in the event of natural disaster. For example, Houston,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8848)|
| 2:27:36| I can go back to many natural disasters last year where Fresenius took product that was on hold and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8856)|
| 2:27:42| used that to ship to people in need during those times. This warehouse has many purposes, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8862)|
| 2:27:50| primarily from a manufacturing perspective is to enable us to grow the hundreds of millions of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8870)|
| 2:27:57| dollars worth of expansion that we have planned at the site. I tried my best to articulate and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8877)|
| 2:28:03| demonstrate to show that to this group as you visited. So those are the reasons that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8883)|
| 2:28:11| we need this facility. We need it as in a close proximity as possible. It helps us in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8891)|
| 2:28:18| transportation, but it also gives us, we have people that traverse between the two sites on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8898)|
| 2:28:24| an ongoing basis. Quality inspection, logistics, drivers. The facility itself, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8904)|
| 2:28:33| facility in question today, the warehouse will house some 150 new employees in East Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8913)|
| 2:28:41| which is additive to the employees that we've already worked with the county commission on at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8921)|

| 2:28:53| Questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8933)|
| 2:28:58| Good evening. I'm Alicia McCauley with Michael Brady Incorporated, 299 North Wise Garber Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8938)|
| 2:29:03| here in Knoxville, Tennessee. Just as our MBI role, we've been hired to complete the surveying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8943)|
| 2:29:11| and civil engineering portion of the project for Fresenius. We've been working with them for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8951)|
| 2:29:15| a few weeks now, and we're also involved with the use on review, which we've already submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8955)|
| 2:29:21| We've been working pretty diligently over the last few weeks. Our role here is really to provide as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8961)|
| 2:29:27| much due diligence and upfront research to make sure this project is viable. That's our goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8967)|
| 2:29:32| Also to incorporate the comments we receive from staff from the neighborhood and from Fresenius.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8972)|
| 2:29:41| Our site plan that you should have received a copy of represents that. We've taken into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8981)|
| 2:29:46| consideration the site views. That was one of the big hurdles that we had. Grading the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8986)|
| 2:29:53| appropriately, providing additional landscaping around the perimeter of the site, anything that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8993)|
| 2:29:58| adjoins the residential uses we've provided above and beyond the landscaping screen. We feel that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=8998)|
| 2:30:05| necessary not only for visual aspects, for noise and light pollution. We've also provided staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9005)|
| 2:30:13| with the full platting process, how the property will be divided up. In addition to that, we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9013)|
| 2:30:20| been working with the architect to increase the appearance of the building itself, try to screen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9020)|
| 2:30:26| the building, use colors that are natural in order to hide the building as best we can. In addition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9026)|
| 2:30:34| to that, completing the geotechnical report, traffic studies, environmental reviews, all of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9034)|
| 2:30:39| those things have come to completion over the last few weeks. We've tried to, again, incorporate all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9039)|
| 2:30:45| of the concerns and questions provided to us and make sure as we proceed forward with use and review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9045)|
| 2:30:51| everything that we're displaying, again, meets the needs of Fresenius but also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9051)|
| 2:30:57| meets the needs of the neighbors as we as we best can to provide that screen and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9057)|
| 2:31:03| buffer so that we're a quiet neighbor and we want the design to reflect that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9063)|
| 2:31:10| So hopefully what you see tonight is that. Thank you very much for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9070)|
| 2:31:18| Mr. Seymour, do you wish to reserve the rest of your time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9078)|
| 2:31:21| I'll have a rebuttal if we may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9081)|
| 2:31:27| Would opposition wish to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9087)|
| 2:31:31| I would like to introduce Jerry Glenn who will address and then have some additional people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9091)|

| 2:31:41| is the wrong zoning. It's not the appropriate zoning for what they're asking to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9101)|

| 2:32:08| who are guilty of crimes and it is their job to find a technicality to make sure those people get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9128)|
| 2:32:17| back out on the street and don't have to suffer the consequences and we believe this encroachment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9137)|
| 2:32:24| is tatamount to a criminal activity on the citizens of this community and we don't want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9144)|
| 2:32:31| you to approve this on a technicality. Listen to the facts and we have other people that wish to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9151)|
| 2:32:41| Ma'am, if you would please give your name and address for the record. Yes, good evening. My| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9161)|
| 2:32:45| name is Tracy Parrott. I live at 6127 Hammer Road, Knoxville, Tennessee. I'm here to speak to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9165)|
| 2:32:51| in regards to my opposition and my community's opposition to the spot rezoning and development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9171)|
| 2:32:56| of the 57-acre track of land off John Speer Highway north of Hammer Road. They state it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9176)|

| 2:33:14| I want to plead to the commission to deny the rezoning and sector change request. On top of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9194)|
| 2:33:19| individuals that came out today to oppose this rezoning, there are many many more of us who do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9199)|
| 2:33:24| not want to see Knox County's rural and agricultural lands developed. There are plenty of other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9204)|
| 2:33:30| properties within Knox County already developed and already zoned appropriately that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9210)|

| 2:37:20| I'd like to, obviously I'm opposed to the rezoning, so we can skip all that. The reasons that I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9440)|
| 2:37:26| specifically going to speak to you today is the topic of the soil conditions, the importance of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9446)|
| 2:37:33| the soil that will be gone. It'll never return once the construction's done or once that land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9453)|
| 2:37:37| is developed, even if not by Presidius. As it stands now, a large portion of this 57-acre tract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9457)|
| 2:37:43| is prime farm soil or it is soil of what's called local importance. This means that soil can be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9463)|
| 2:37:49| easily cultivated with a large number of different crop types, which gives a variety of what you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9469)|
| 2:37:55| do with it. Lands like this provides food sustainability that is grown locally. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9475)|
| 2:38:01| National Soil Tilth Laboratory highlighted in a recent publication that each human on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9481)|
| 2:38:07| earth right now, to feed them, takes one-third of a football field of land. And then with population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9487)|
| 2:38:14| growth, urbanization, it'll shrink that available land base in half by 2050. In real terms, more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9494)|
| 2:38:22| people, less land, less food. Only 11% of the world's surface is suitable for food production,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9502)|
| 2:38:30| which means that lands that are sustainable for local or national food growth need to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9510)|
| 2:38:34| preserved. Rather, it's 20 acres, 2,000 acres, the preservation is still necessary. Only 18%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9514)|
| 2:38:41| of Knox County's acreage is considered prime soil. With each rezoning and each development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9521)|
| 2:38:46| that percentage shrinks. This year alone, from January to April 2018, Knox County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9526)|
| 2:38:56| approved 248 acres to be rezoned from agricultural to some type of other use for development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9536)|
| 2:39:05| If this trend continues in 2018, an estimated 993 acres will be changed from agricultural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9545)|
| 2:39:12| to something developed. In another five years, by 2023, that's 4,965 acres that are no longer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9552)|
| 2:39:21| zoned agricultural. A recent trend in land use in some areas has been a loss of some prime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9561)|
| 2:39:27| farmland to industrial and urban uses. The loss of prime farmland to other uses put pressure on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9567)|
| 2:39:33| the marginal lands, which generally are more erodible, droughty, less productive, and cannot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9573)|
| 2:39:38| easily be cultivated. These marginal lands also do not provide minerals needed for the crops to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9578)|
| 2:39:42| obtain nutritional value for the food. The soil is depleted. There was a recent survey, I'm not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9582)|
| 2:39:48| going to give the details because I'm running out of time, but compared to 1975 to 1997,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9588)|
| 2:39:55| foods lost 27% of their calcium, 37% of their iron, and 30% of their vitamin C because of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9595)|
| 2:40:02| depletion of the soil viability. So if you take away the prime soil, then you have lesser soil,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9602)|
| 2:40:10| you have lesser nutrition in your food. It doesn't seem like a big deal for just this 57 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9610)|
| 2:40:15| but this sets a precedent for future change. And then the next thing you know, you're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9615)|
| 2:40:21| blink and everything's going to be gone. So I would like to close with Franklin Roosevelt said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9621)|

| 2:40:52| and your current population are also of great importance. And it's really difficult because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9652)|
| 2:40:58| diesel exhaust is a group one carcinogen. Diesel trucks emit a myriad of harmful pollutants such| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9658)|
| 2:41:03| as carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and respirable particulate matters such| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9663)|
| 2:41:08| as aerodynamic diameters of two and a half micrometers and less. Air pollution has both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9668)|

| 2:41:20| reduced life expectancy. The community living near John Sevier Highway is already at risk for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9680)|
| 2:41:24| such conditions as one study found that people living close to highways are more susceptible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9684)|
| 2:41:28| to serious health effects from air pollutants. The distribution center would bring numerous diesel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9688)|
| 2:41:32| burning trucks to a centralized location that would be in continuous operation. Trucks in and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9692)|
| 2:41:36| around the distribution facility and warehouses spend a significant time idling and under low| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9696)|
| 2:41:41| engine loads while loading and maneuvering around the facility. A 2016 study by the Argonne| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9701)|
| 2:41:45| National Laboratory found that heavy trucks with emissions reducing equipment including diesel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9705)|
| 2:41:49| exhaust fluid or DEF and selective catalytic reduction reactions in near dock conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9709)|
| 2:41:54| such as low speeds and low engine loads resulted in significantly increased NOX emissions compared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9714)|
| 2:41:59| to other duty cycles such as regional driving, urban dynamometer schedules, etc. This is because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9719)|
| 2:42:04| most emission controls are designed to operate under driving conditions only and not at idle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9724)|
| 2:42:08| a condition omnipresent at distribution facilities such as the one proposed above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9728)|
| 2:42:12| This means that the emissions created at the proposed distribution center should rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9732)|
| 2:42:16| and sector plan amendment be allowed would create a hazardous air condition for the residents near| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9736)|
| 2:42:21| the facility. There's also the very serious matter of soil and surface water and groundwater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9741)|
| 2:42:27| contamination from leaks and spills of diesel fuel and oil from the heavy trucks that will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9747)|
| 2:42:30| operating at this location. This proposed facility will be situated directly next to and uphill from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9750)|
| 2:42:35| a blue line stream that is a tributary to the Holston River and in close proximity to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9755)|
| 2:42:39| Holston River itself. Incidentally, the Holston River is at its closest proximity to John Sevier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9759)|
| 2:42:43| Highway directly across the proposed entrance for this facility which is about 60 feet from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9763)|
| 2:42:49| shoulder of John Sevier to the river. HMHTTC Response Inc., an emergency response company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9769)|
| 2:42:58| stated that 60% of the 2,500 hazardous materials and non-HAZMAT incidents they receive in a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9778)|
| 2:43:04| are related to diesel fuel spills. These incidents primarily occur in and around loading docks and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9784)|
| 2:43:08| during basic docking maneuvers. Tom Moses, president of the Spill Center, an Acton mass-based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9788)|
| 2:43:14| environmental claims management company, says about half of the spills it processes involve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9794)|
| 2:43:18| ruptured saddle tanks, those are the fuel tanks on the sides of these vehicles. The average amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9798)|
| 2:43:22| of fuel released is just over 100 gallons. Due to the facility's proximity to the aforementioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9802)|
| 2:43:26| waterways, any spill or leak would pose an immediate threat to the aquatic ecosystem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9806)|
| 2:43:30| It could rapidly travel downstream, affecting a considerably larger area. This type of incident| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9810)|
| 2:43:35| will have immediate deleterious impacts on the surrounding river system and beyond, affecting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9815)|
| 2:43:38| all aquatic life, vertebrates and invertebrates, plant life, by reducing species density as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9818)|
| 2:43:43| as diversity. Beyond the short-term impacts, there are also long-term indirect effects that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9823)|
| 2:43:47| can drastically alter the aquatic ecosystem as a result of water contamination. There's also one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9827)|
| 2:43:53| other item that I'd like to call into question, and that's actually the number of vehicles that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9833)|
| 2:43:58| this facility will serve. It's certainly capable of serving almost 400 trucks with its size,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9838)|
| 2:44:04| based on national averages, and then based on stated manufacturing volumes, it could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9844)|
| 2:44:09| potentially be more like 80 trucks based on standard pallet dimensions and a 24-hour process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9849)|
| 2:44:14| once it's up and running. Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9854)|
| 2:44:16| I'll do my best, gentlemen. A lot of these have been covered. Spot zoning, of course. We're right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9856)|

| 2:45:39| pushing to get this thing done in a hurry so they can squeak in under the 45-foot limit. There are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9939)|
| 2:45:47| other available sites. If you'll look in here, I put a minimum of six. I can get you more if you want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9947)|

| 2:45:59| sites. They don't have to go in the middle of a community. This wouldn't happen in Farragut. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9959)|
| 2:46:07| know that. Of course, we don't have the clout or the availability, but Exhibit A there has those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9967)|
| 2:46:13| other sites available. This is a site that's dangerous to develop. I included maps there that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9973)|
| 2:46:20| show the sinkholes. The seismic fault, there's a seismic fault that circumvents this property. That| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=9980)|

| 2:47:20| if they're willing to grant you more time. Okay. I think this is a big issue. I don't think we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=10040)|

| 2:47:42| Thanks, sir. Okay, go ahead. We're concerned that if this is designed, that this runoff is designed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=10062)|
| 2:47:51| based on this existing FEMA map, that it is going to be flawed. The flooding that we see, how many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=10071)|
| 2:48:01| people here have seen this flood how many times a year? Hold up your fingers. We have flooding there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=10081)|
| 2:48:09| and we know that this needs to be revisited with the engineers, and they'll confess the same thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=10089)|
| 2:48:15| is true. This can't be designed using this flawed flood map, which they are using right this minute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=10095)|
| 2:48:23| to calculate this cut and fill that is about to happen. We've seen no studies. We've seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=10103)|

| 2:49:05| but you made a statement when you first started about this site that this was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=10145)|
| 2:49:14| an ideal industrial location, and I agree with you, but this is not an industrial use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=10154)|
| 2:49:23| This, what you'll see in page two there of this, this is a wrong zoning. Guys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=10163)|
| 2:49:33| somebody's pulling the wool over your eyes. The greatest potential for error lies in the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=10173)|
| 2:49:40| that the proposed use is without a doubt an industrial use. Tell me you know of a 600,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=10180)|
| 2:49:49| square foot trucking terminal that is not considered industrial. The planned commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=10189)|
| 2:49:55| zoning does quote light distribution. Okay, light distribution centers. Those three words, light| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=10195)|

| 2:50:40| 40,000 square feet. Now, we do have a light distribution. We have several trucking terminals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=10240)|
| 2:50:48| built in light distribution centers in Knox County, so I can't deny that. The average size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=10248)|

| 2:51:44| about air pollution, and we have discussed that with Knox County Engineering. I don't know whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=10304)|

| 2:55:03| information, we did hire GeoServices, a local firm, to complete the geotechnical study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=10503)|
| 2:55:08| exploration of the site, and I've got a 300-page report here, including some environmental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=10508)|
| 2:55:14| assessments, so we've thoroughly reviewed that, and I'll just go through the conclusion page here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=10514)|
| 2:55:20| and based on the results of their exploration, it is their opinion that the site is generally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=10520)|
| 2:55:24| adaptable for the proposed construction, so obviously, as an engineering consultant, I will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=10524)|
| 2:55:32| obviously base our design on their restrictions and recommendations, but again, we've exhausted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=10532)|
| 2:55:39| every effort to make sure that what we're designing and moving forward with is engineering sound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=10539)|
| 2:55:46| I will also address the concerns related to stormwater and the flooding concerns. We are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=10546)|
| 2:55:54| obviously under requirements from Knox County Engineering to ensure that the proposed development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=10554)|
| 2:55:59| does not obviously adversely impact the neighbors, the downstream system, and part of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=10559)|
| 2:56:07| engineering grouping will be to show that result, provide stormwater quality, stormwater quantity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=10567)|
| 2:56:15| in addition to working with TDEC and Knox County Engineering. We have stream buffer requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=10575)|
| 2:56:20| that we're required to maintain, so all of that will be incorporated into the design itself. Again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=10580)|
| 2:56:27| take good pride in our due diligence research, and we've spared no expense at making sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=10587)|
| 2:56:33| everything's been reviewed, looked at, and will be incorporated into our design. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=10593)|
| 2:56:37| Sir, would you like a rebuttal? You have up to three minutes. Thank you. Very briefly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=10597)|

| 2:57:26| I think they've requested the wrong zoning on purpose, and I would respectfully ask you to deny| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=10646)|
| 2:57:32| their request. Thank you. Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=10652)|
| 2:57:41| Questions of commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=10661)|
| 2:57:44| Vice Chair Bussler. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Gerald. Yes, sir. There was a statement that made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=10664)|
| 2:57:52| sorry, Mr. Green. There was a statement just made about light industrial and heavy industrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=10672)|
| 2:58:01| Can you give us the definition between light and heavy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=10681)|
| 2:58:06| First, I'd be happy to, Commissioner Bussler, but first, this is not an industrial use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=10686)|
| 2:58:12| Industrial is defined as the creation or manufacture or production of material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=10692)|
| 2:58:18| As you heard the Fresenius spokesperson say, this is a place where material that's manufactured or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=10698)|
| 2:58:25| created at another location will be stored and then shipped. That's the definition of distribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=10705)|
| 2:58:31| And what we look at, and actually it's the County Codes Enforcement that does the definition and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=10711)|
| 2:58:39| the determination of use, appropriate uses in a zoning district. What they look at is not the size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=10719)|
| 2:58:45| of the building, but the activity generated. And as was pointed out by, I believe, the staff person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=10725)|
| 2:58:53| from Knox County, air quality, but it is also in the traffic impact analysis and has been stated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=10733)|
| 2:58:59| before that you will have 28 trucks per day. 28 trucks over a 24-hour period is just over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=10739)|
| 2:59:05| one truck per hour. So that qualifies for the light distribution in the aspect that it does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=10745)|
| 2:59:13| not generate the amount of traffic, say, a FedEx terminal would that would be considered a heavy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=10753)|
| 2:59:21| distribution center. And so it's looking at the activity and the impact that results from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=10761)|
| 2:59:27| that activity as opposed to the size of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=10767)|
| 2:59:36| Mr. Irwin, can I ask you a question? I was out there to look at the facility and there was another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=10776)|
| 2:59:43| issue brought up about diesel fuel being leaked and ruptured tanks and things of that sort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=10783)|
| 2:59:51| You're out there in the industrial park and right beside you is, I think, Expo, just Expo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=10791)|
| 2:59:59| XPO. They have a lot of trucks out there. Have you seen very much spillage of, since you've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=10799)|
| 3:00:07| been out there, of ruptured tanks at XPO? No, sir. I essentially manage the entire facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=10807)|
| 3:00:17| inside and out. We've had no issues with our current neighbors, which have a significantly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=10817)|
| 3:00:24| higher rate of exchange of trucks than what we're proposing. Okay, now from your production plant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=10824)|
| 3:00:34| to the storage unit, what is basically the poundage that will be in that they will transport| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=10834)|
| 3:00:41| on this road? Yes, sir. Commissioner, I'm not really an expert at trucking, so I'll use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=10841)|
| 3:00:47| approximations. I can refer to our experts on the exact load, but we will essentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=10847)|
| 3:00:53| weigh out rather than load out a truck. Can someone give me the general weight of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=10853)|
| 3:00:59| vehicle? I don't want to be wrong. Yes, David Weaver, Presidio Medical, Ogden, Utah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=10859)|
| 3:01:05| For a fully weighted truck, standard cube out is the term. Full capacity, full weight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=10865)|
| 3:01:10| around 23,000 pounds. 23,000 pounds. That's really not a very heavy truck. No, sir, it is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=10870)|
| 3:01:20| Okay, thank you. Thank you, sir. Commissioner Anders. Two things. One, it would be for Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=10880)|
| 3:01:27| Green for right now. Mr. Green, we talked about the, Charlie asked my question about defining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=10887)|
| 3:01:34| light industrial. If this were approved and it was light industrial for distribution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=10894)|
| 3:01:43| could somebody come in and manufacture later, or would that be prohibited on this site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=10903)|
| 3:01:51| With the planned commercial, the site plan and the operation are both reviewed and approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=10911)|
| 3:01:57| so any change in operation would require first a zoning compliance and then plan compliance. If| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=10917)|
| 3:02:05| it were converted to manufacturing, especially heavy manufacturing, that would not be permitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=10925)|
| 3:02:10| under the existing zoning. Mr. Erwin, if you don't mind. When I met with you guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=10930)|
| 3:02:21| to talk about this, one of the concerns I had was just the sheer of the site. You all had assured| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=10941)|
| 3:02:27| me that you've looked everywhere in the vicinity of the area, and you explained to me the reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=10947)|
| 3:02:35| why it needs to be approximated, and you tried to look at buying the neighbors and things like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=10955)|
| 3:02:40| that. Yes, sir. Did you all, I mean, some of the sites that they've sent us here, and you may not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=10960)|
| 3:02:46| have seen this, a few of the sites are kind of a not-in-my-backyard, because it's a very similar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=10966)|
| 3:02:51| one they sent up on Breakville Road, but there's one on Straw Plains Park that was 63 acres. Did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=10971)|
| 3:02:57| you all look in that area, or did you go outside of the industrial park area? Where did you go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=10977)|
| 3:03:02| Commissioner, without seeing the exhibit, I couldn't really speak to that precise location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=10982)|
| 3:03:07| I'd again refer, I know that we have looked exhaustively over the last year or more for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=10987)|
| 3:03:13| all industrial sites available. Can anybody speak to the exact industrial site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=10993)|
| 3:03:28| Good evening. Reiner Schmidt, Percentage Medical Care. Could you please come and offer the mic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11008)|
| 3:03:38| Reiner Schmidt, Percentage Medical Care. We looked for about nine months. We went to the TVA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11018)|
| 3:03:44| all the sites that are available on site, and that they'd recommend available. We worked with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11024)|
| 3:03:49| Bob Thornton. He showed us every available parcel. So for us, it was within 10 miles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11029)|
| 3:03:58| accessibility, utilities, the right size, physical condition, and availability, so that we can build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11038)|
| 3:04:06| it and be ready for the plant that's already being expanded. And that was the only site that worked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11046)|
| 3:04:13| out of everything that we looked at during that period of time. Thank you. That's my questions for now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11053)|
| 3:04:20| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11060)|
| 3:04:24| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. A couple of quick questions. And I don't know who wants to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11064)|
| 3:04:30| answer this. How long has this property been for sale? Arthur, do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11070)|
| 3:04:39| Bob Thornton, how long has it been for sale? About a year. So it has been for sale for a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11079)|
| 3:04:46| And once again, on the design, and maybe this is an NBI question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11086)|
| 3:04:53| and you're talking about such a secure facility, is it going to look like a fortress, or is it going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11093)|
| 3:04:57| to be? I saw the designs you got in the email today, which look very welcoming. Right. The goal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11097)|
| 3:05:06| for us was to blend and hide as much as we can. Obviously, it's a distribution center, so really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11106)|
| 3:05:15| it's not meant to be something super magnificent. It's there for a reason and a purpose. So our goal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11115)|
| 3:05:21| was to screen it from all visibility and also to use natural colors. You know, Fresenius has a true| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11121)|
| 3:05:29| blue color, and originally we had some blue in here, and we felt like that was creating the wrong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11129)|
| 3:05:36| aesthetic. So we've blended that in with the natural setting. So between landscaping and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11136)|
| 3:05:41| natural tones, obviously it's hard to hide a building of this size, but we've done everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11141)|
| 3:05:47| possible to make sure it's as aesthetically pleasing as it can be. And percentage-wise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11147)|
| 3:05:53| how much traffic would you say is going to be on Roscoe Lane as compared to come out the front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11153)|
| 3:05:58| onto John Sevier? Well, we mentioned our truck entrance, of course, is on John Sevier, and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11158)|
| 3:06:04| our employee access is actually on Roscoe. So the goal for us with that was to try to separate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11164)|
| 3:06:10| truck and employee traffic or car traffic. That's just important. So our shifts, our traditional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11170)|
| 3:06:17| employees working in the plant and the office would obviously use that front entry. We have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11177)|
| 3:06:21| limited number of, you know, visitors and things like that, and then the truck traffic would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11181)|
| 3:06:27| strictly be on John Sevier. So you're talking about 80% of it coming on Roscoe? I would say probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11187)|
| 3:06:33| 70 to 30, yeah. Okay. Eventually, this facility between office and warehouse personnel will have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11193)|
| 3:06:42| about 150 people in it, and they will all be directed onto Roscoe Lane, and the office entrance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11202)|
| 3:06:50| will be coming off Roscoe. And this may be a quick question for our Knox County expert on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11210)|
| 3:06:58| pollution. Are you just involved more in the air pollution or in all types?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11218)|
| 3:07:09| We do, we permit facilities. We do mobile emission budgets. We do modeling for air| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11229)|
| 3:07:15| dispersion. We do a lot. Let me tell you where I'm going, and you'd say, I don't know, or you can say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11235)|
| 3:07:20| well, this is what I can say. When we went through Midway, which a lot of this to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11240)|
| 3:07:25| sounds a lot like reliving Midway, you know, in some extent, we always heard at Midway that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11245)|
| 3:07:36| farmland with animals is more toxic than a gas station would be, for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11256)|
| 3:07:45| I can't really speak to that. My initial gut would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11265)|
| 3:07:49| animals do have their own emissions. They do generate emissions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11269)|
| 3:07:57| We do quantify those, but as a comparison, I don't. Okay, all right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11277)|
| 3:08:07| Which one of you is here first? Which one was first? Oh, you got these two. Me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11287)|
| 3:08:13| All right. Commissioner Gill. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have a couple of questions for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11293)|
| 3:08:20| community that came and did the tour, and I'd like to hear some of their observations, because I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11300)|
| 3:08:28| really want to acknowledge some of, first of all, what they have to say and hear some of their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11308)|
| 3:08:36| feedback, concerns about what they experienced when they did the tour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11316)|
| 3:08:50| Beautiful plant. They've got their act together in manufacturing, and we feel that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11330)|
| 3:08:59| their business and their industry is a real asset to Knox County. The jobs they generate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11339)|
| 3:09:08| the benefits they have to our economy. We just feel like they're trying to plant this bomb in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11348)|
| 3:09:18| the wrong place. There are other industrial sites available, but I like the plant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11358)|
| 3:09:26| I just want to follow up with some statements, because, and I want to acknowledge the opposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=11366)|
