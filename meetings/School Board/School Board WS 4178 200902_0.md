| 0:06:27| And now we'll have the superintendent's report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=387)|
| 0:06:28| Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=388)|
| 0:06:29| Thank you, Madam Chair, members of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=389)|
| 0:06:30| Several updates for you this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=390)|
| 0:06:31| I'd like to begin by thanking our students, families, teachers, and other school employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=391)|
| 0:06:32| for all of their work to make our first eight days of school a great success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=392)|
| 0:06:33| So yay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=393)|
| 0:06:34| We've said all along that this is a very different year and there will be some challenges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=394)|
| 0:06:52| along the way, but I do think we've gotten better every day and that we're smoothing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=412)|
| 0:06:57| out some of those bumps in the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=417)|
| 0:06:58| So we'll continue to work on the challenges and make sure that we're doing the very best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=418)|
| 0:07:03| we can do each and every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=423)|
| 0:07:05| I visited several schools last week, got a chance to watch some of our virtual teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=425)|
| 0:07:09| in action, virtual program teachers in action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=429)|
| 0:07:13| I was so impressed to see them not only providing instruction, but also helping students navigate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=433)|
| 0:07:18| new technology, troubleshoot issues related to their Wi-Fi connection, their Chromebooks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=438)|
| 0:07:24| or the district's online platform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=444)|
| 0:07:27| I also got to see the new health and safety protocols that are in place for in-person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=447)|
| 0:07:30| students and staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=450)|
| 0:07:32| And I'll have to say I was very pleased to see our school communities wearing masks and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=452)|
| 0:07:36| embracing physical distancing where possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=456)|
| 0:07:39| In fact, when I stepped into a classroom at Bill Morris, one young man asked me to step| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=459)|
| 0:07:43| over closer to his desk and he shared his personal hand sanitizer with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=463)|
| 0:07:48| So our students are really doing a great job, and our teachers as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=468)|
| 0:07:54| It's so important to embrace these practices and slow the spread of COVID-19, so I want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=474)|
| 0:07:58| to encourage our schools to keep up the great work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=478)|
| 0:08:01| I'd also like to point out that a dashboard is now available on our website at www.knoxschools.org| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=481)|
| 0:08:08| slash COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=488)|
| 0:08:09| This dashboard includes active cases within the district, recovered cases, and numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=489)|
| 0:08:14| of people in isolation or quarantine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=494)|
| 0:08:17| And I'd also like to thank our staff for the excellent work that they've done on the dashboard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=497)|
| 0:08:22| If you haven't looked at it, please take a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=502)|
| 0:08:24| I think it's very good and also very informative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=504)|
| 0:08:29| In addition, we've recently added the new information related to our decision-making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=509)|
| 0:08:34| about the daily attendance model of green, yellow, and red.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=514)|
| 0:08:38| So that was not previously on the dashboard, but you can find it there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=518)|
| 0:08:43| In the last couple of weeks, visitors to our site may have noticed that the district has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=523)|
| 0:08:46| consistently been in the red zone for one of our metrics, and that being substitute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=526)|
| 0:08:51| availability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=531)|
| 0:08:52| With that in mind, we've recently taken steps to increase the number of substitutes that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=532)|
| 0:08:56| are available in our school buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=536)|
| 0:08:58| First, we've implemented a substitute pay incentive that would provide an additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=538)|
| 0:09:03| $300 a month for substitutes working 10 to 14 days a month, and an additional $500 a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=543)|
| 0:09:09| month for substitutes working 15 days or more during a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=549)|
| 0:09:14| We also plan to hire 20 to 25 full-time positions that can be assigned for substitute needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=554)|
| 0:09:20| across the district, and our hope is that these steps will increase the pool of substitute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=560)|
| 0:09:24| teachers that we can draw from and enable us to continue opening or operating in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=564)|
| 0:09:29| yellow attendance mode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=569)|
| 0:09:33| On a related note, I know that a lot of rumors continue to circulate about our intentions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=573)|
| 0:09:37| regarding the attendance model and whether we're planning to go virtual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=577)|
| 0:09:42| As I communicated with our families last week, it is possible that at some point during| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=582)|
| 0:09:46| the school year we may have specific classes, specific grade levels within a school, or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=586)|
| 0:09:51| specific schools that move to online learning for a period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=591)|
| 0:09:55| We are asking that every family have a plan in place in case that happens at your school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=595)|
| 0:10:00| However, I want to make it clear that our goal is to continue in-person instruction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=600)|
| 0:10:08| for as many students as possible for as long as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=608)|
| 0:10:11| I know that virtual learning would be very difficult for many families, and that's why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=611)|
| 0:10:15| we're working so hard on mask wearing, hand washing, and physical distancing to slow the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=615)|
| 0:10:20| spread of COVID-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=620)|
| 0:10:23| And I have some very good news from our nutrition department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=623)|
| 0:10:26| Earlier this week, the United States Department of Agriculture provided districts with an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=626)|
| 0:10:30| optional new flexibility that will allow KCS to temporarily provide free breakfast and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=630)|
| 0:10:36| lunch to all students regardless of income status or school attended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=636)|
| 0:10:42| We have opted to take advantage of this flexibility, and it will begin on Tuesday, September 8th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=642)|
| 0:10:47| for all of our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=647)|
| 0:10:49| It's important to point out that this program will end no later than December 31st, 2020,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=649)|
| 0:10:55| and could end sooner depending on federal funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=655)|
| 0:10:57| However, for now, we're very pleased that every student at every school will be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=657)|
| 0:11:01| to receive free breakfast and lunch starting on September 8th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=661)|
| 0:11:06| Finally, I wanted to provide an update about the ACT testing process for seniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=666)|
| 0:11:11| Seniors who would have taken the test in the spring can take it for free during the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=671)|
| 0:11:15| day on Tuesday, September 22nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=675)|
| 0:11:19| Virtual program students who want to take the test on that day must come into their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=679)|
| 0:11:23| school building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=683)|
| 0:11:26| Seniors who did not use a free voucher during the summer can also take the test for free| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=686)|
| 0:11:29| on a national testing date in October or December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=689)|
| 0:11:34| Also, it's important to note that while some colleges and universities don't require the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=694)|
| 0:11:39| ACT, it's still a graduation requirement within the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=699)|
| 0:11:44| Madam Chair and members of the Board, that concludes my report for this evening, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=704)|
| 0:11:47| at this time I'd like to do something a little different and share a couple of videos related| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=707)|
| 0:11:51| to our reopening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=711)|

| 0:12:10| As I said earlier, we visited several schools, I think 11 in all total, and again, just so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=730)|
| 0:12:16| impressed with each of the visits at our schools, with how hard our teachers and our administrators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=736)|
| 0:12:24| and school staff are working to make the in-person learning experience everything we want it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=744)|

| 0:12:34| staff, but I hope this will provide a small glimpse into the tremendous work that they've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=754)|
| 0:12:38| been doing during our reopening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=758)|

| 0:15:27| It's incredible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=927)|
| 0:15:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=928)|
| 0:15:29| We will turn to the discussion of our September 9th regular session agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=929)|
| 0:15:34| Board members, before we start that discussion, I wanted to mention a couple of updates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=934)|
| 0:15:40| You received an email this afternoon from Terry explaining that item 7D has been withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=940)|
| 0:15:46| Notification was received that the grantor will be requiring a grant agreement that will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=946)|

| 0:16:57| the way back to March and I know you guys have been working diligently and I think everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1017)|
| 0:17:01| sees that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1021)|
| 0:17:02| The video was a great representation of all the really good work that's gone in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1022)|
| 0:17:05| I also think it's important for the public to understand what are some of the specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1025)|
| 0:17:09| challenges that you're seeing as we're getting into the start of school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1029)|
| 0:17:12| You referenced substitute teachers and having a lack but is there anything that just comes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1032)|
| 0:17:18| top of your mind that you're seeing that we need to continue to look at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1038)|
| 0:17:22| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1042)|
| 0:17:24| There's been a few glitches with the Microsoft teams with the internet connections and things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1044)|
| 0:17:29| of that nature but those are gradually getting worked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1049)|
| 0:17:33| I'm hearing maybe the first day was a little bit rough but after that it's gotten better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1053)|
| 0:17:39| And just work with the students in terms of their familiarity with their laptops and getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1059)|
| 0:17:46| them on the Canvas and just doing all those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1066)|
| 0:17:50| So it's been actually, compared to some stories I've heard about other districts that had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1070)|
| 0:17:56| issues, ours has gone extremely well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1076)|
| 0:18:00| So thanks to our IT staff and also the work in John's department, Teresa Nixon working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1080)|
| 0:18:08| and Shannon Jackson working with our teachers and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1088)|
| 0:18:12| I just really heard from teachers about, hey, I was concerned about this, didn't know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1092)|
| 0:18:17| I could do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1097)|
| 0:18:18| I mean one teacher almost teared up on us and just told us how proud she was of herself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1098)|
| 0:18:23| Yeah, that was one of my teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1103)|
| 0:18:26| Yeah, I didn't think I could do this but you know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1106)|
| 0:18:29| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1109)|
| 0:18:30| I did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1110)|
| 0:18:31| So it's just really amazing to see how hard our folks are working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1111)|
| 0:18:36| I think some parents maybe have also gotten in the picture, I think, with some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1116)|
| 0:18:44| teachers with their classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1124)|
| 0:18:45| So I know parents are engaged in their students, their learning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1125)|
| 0:18:51| So I did hear some of this too, that teachers were saying, and we've gotten emails, parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1131)|
| 0:18:57| just seeing how hard teachers are working to make this work and the in-person things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1137)|
| 0:19:04| going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1144)|
| 0:19:05| One teacher, she had her backdrop up, she had her lighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1145)|
| 0:19:09| I told her, I said, now don't leave us for TV after you do this for a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1149)|
| 0:19:15| But she just had it going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1155)|
| 0:19:17| So our teachers, I really hate, I don't want to jinx this, I couldn't imagine that it would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1157)|
| 0:19:24| have gone as well as it's gone at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1164)|
| 0:19:27| And again, there have been glitches and bumps in the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1167)|
| 0:19:30| And people, our parents have just been extremely patient with us and we ask for grace and we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1170)|
| 0:19:36| received grace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1176)|
| 0:19:37| And it's fun too to ask the students, are you glad to be back in school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1177)|
| 0:19:44| We've gotten nods and thumbs up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1184)|
| 0:19:46| So I know our students are excited to be back and ask the question about your laptop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1186)|
| 0:19:50| Do you like your laptop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1190)|
| 0:19:52| Again, nods and thumbs up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1192)|
| 0:19:54| So it's just really going well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1194)|
| 0:19:57| And again, there will be some more challenges along the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1197)|
| 0:20:00| But our staff is committed and dedicated to making this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1200)|
| 0:20:04| And our teachers, after seeing all the work that they're doing, even at Green Elementary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1204)|
| 0:20:09| this morning, just went for a brief visit there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1209)|
| 0:20:12| And teachers, it was almost like school's been in session for two months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1212)|
| 0:20:16| I mean, you wouldn't know that we hadn't been in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1216)|
| 0:20:18| So they were busy doing assessments, finding out where the students are in their learning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1218)|
| 0:20:23| identifying that so we can get them caught up and introduce the new learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1223)|
| 0:20:28| So, even learned a little Spanish in one of our fourth grade classrooms last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1228)|
| 0:20:36| Sarah Moore Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1236)|
| 0:20:38| Just a lot of amazing things going on in our school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1238)|
| 0:20:42| And I can't tell you and tell this board how proud I am to have the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1242)|
| 0:20:47| to serve you and serve our community and serve the students and teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1247)|
| 0:20:51| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1251)|
| 0:20:53| It's very heartwarming just to get out and see all the work that's being done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1253)|
| 0:20:59| So I know I've talked more than the challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1259)|
| 0:21:02| I appreciate that. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1262)|
| 0:21:04| But just to share some of my excitement with you, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1264)|
| 0:21:07| So thank you, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1267)|
| 0:21:09| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1269)|
| 0:21:10| Anybody else have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1270)|
| 0:21:12| I'm sorry, I forgot to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1272)|
| 0:21:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1274)|
| 0:21:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1276)|
| 0:21:17| We'll turn to contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1277)|
| 0:21:20| Any questions on C1 and 2?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1280)|

| 0:21:57| Okay, moving to grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1317)|
| 0:21:59| Any questions on A or B?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1319)|
| 0:22:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1324)|

| 0:22:20| Any questions on either contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1340)|
| 0:22:24| Ms. Edwin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1344)|

| 0:22:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1349)|
| 0:22:31| Anything else on contracts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1351)|
| 0:22:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1353)|
| 0:22:36| Moving to regular agenda items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1356)|
| 0:22:38| Any questions on A?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1358)|
| 0:22:43| Any questions on B?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1363)|
| 0:22:49| Okay, questions on C?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1369)|
| 0:22:51| Ms. Babs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1371)|
| 0:22:53| Yes, and Mr. Thomas, this might be for Mr. Oaks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1373)|
| 0:22:56| but I was looking at the schematic for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1376)|
| 0:22:59| and I did have an email from somebody in the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1379)|
| 0:23:03| about the attendance level at the school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1383)|
| 0:23:06| and when I was looking at the schematic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1386)|
| 0:23:08| one question I had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1388)|
| 0:23:10| is there room for the school to be expanded?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1390)|
| 0:23:13| It did sort of look locked when I was looking at the pictures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1393)|
| 0:23:16| And the other question I had was about playground space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1396)|
| 0:23:19| It did not look like a lot of playground space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1399)|
| 0:23:21| for a fairly large school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1401)|
| 0:23:23| so maybe you could kind of talk about that also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1403)|
| 0:23:28| Mr. Oaks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1408)|
| 0:23:30| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1410)|
| 0:23:32| As you look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1412)|
| 0:23:34| the school as it is currently designed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1414)|
| 0:23:37| is for about 900 students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1417)|
| 0:23:40| with an addition to take it to 1,200 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1420)|
| 0:23:43| Because if you look at the schematic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1423)|
| 0:23:46| there's area there to show an addition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1426)|
| 0:23:49| There's dotted areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1429)|
| 0:23:51| That's the dotted line where it can show an addition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1431)|
| 0:23:54| Normally what we do in these kind of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1434)|
| 0:23:58| is when we bid the final design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1438)|
| 0:24:01| we'll bid it with an alternate to go to 1,200 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1441)|
| 0:24:05| That's what we did with North Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1445)|
| 0:24:07| If we get a good price,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1447)|
| 0:24:09| we can accept that alternate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1449)|
| 0:24:11| and we'll build the school for 1,200 students to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1451)|
| 0:24:14| But otherwise it will be at about 900 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1454)|
| 0:24:18| And the concept zone that we shared with the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1458)|
| 0:24:21| when we proposed this a couple of years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1461)|
| 0:24:25| would basically pull about 450 students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1465)|
| 0:24:28| out of Hardin Valley Elementary School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1468)|
| 0:24:31| and about 300 out of Carnes Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1471)|
| 0:24:34| So the new school, as it currently sits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1474)|
| 0:24:37| if the board approved the concept zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1477)|
| 0:24:40| or something similar to it when we get to that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1480)|
| 0:24:43| would open with about 750 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1483)|
| 0:24:46| So it would have some room to grow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1486)|
| 0:24:49| and it would give Hardin Valley and Carnes room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1489)|
| 0:24:52| to grow back as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1492)|
| 0:24:54| I guess that's a question I do have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1494)|
| 0:24:57| So if we took from Carnes Elementary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1497)|
| 0:25:00| and Hardin Valley Elementary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1500)|
| 0:25:03| would those schools then have a little bit of capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1503)|
| 0:25:06| or is it basically going to get them down to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1506)|
| 0:25:09| They'll have a little bit of capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1509)|
| 0:25:12| They won't have 500 students of capacity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1512)|
| 0:25:15| but they'll pick up a little bit of capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1515)|
| 0:25:18| And on your playground question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1518)|
| 0:25:22| as we get closer into the design process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1522)|
| 0:25:25| and do the final design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1525)|
| 0:25:28| normally what we'll do with elementary schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1528)|
| 0:25:31| is we'll provide a couple of playgrounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1531)|
| 0:25:34| There'll be one for the lower grades| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1534)|
| 0:25:37| and one for the upper grades in the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1537)|
| 0:25:40| But we'll find a way to work those into the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1540)|
| 0:25:43| We have plenty of space available on the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1543)|
| 0:25:46| It's just figuring out how to use it as we go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1546)|
| 0:25:49| There's not a lot of capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1549)|
| 0:25:52| at Carnes and Hardin Valley Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1552)|
| 0:25:55| And this is not an issue for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1555)|
| 0:25:58| but for the county and the zoning and everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1558)|
| 0:26:01| that's just where more neighborhoods go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1561)|
| 0:26:04| And so I could see this person's concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1564)|
| 0:26:07| about we're already going to probably open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1567)|
| 0:26:10| being full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1570)|
| 0:26:13| Well, there's that concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1573)|
| 0:26:17| There are a number of things that we have to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1577)|
| 0:26:20| when we look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1580)|
| 0:26:23| We try to keep our elementary schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1583)|
| 0:26:26| generally not to be bigger than about 1,200 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1586)|
| 0:26:29| Rarely can you fix a population problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1589)|
| 0:26:32| with one school or just looking at one school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1592)|
| 0:26:35| Right now in the capital plan that the board approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1595)|
| 0:26:38| they approved doing a feasibility study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1598)|
| 0:26:41| for how we address the elementary growth problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1601)|
| 0:26:45| in the Farragut zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1605)|
| 0:26:48| And so that's ongoing, and we hope to get some information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1608)|
| 0:26:51| back out of that by about the December time frame| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1611)|
| 0:26:54| so we can look at how to build the capital plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1614)|
| 0:26:57| going forward on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1617)|
| 0:27:00| In that email, too, there was a suggestion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1620)|
| 0:27:03| that we do a 20-year projection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1623)|
| 0:27:06| And that is really problematic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1626)|
| 0:27:09| to do because the further away we get from today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1629)|
| 0:27:12| the less accurate we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1632)|
| 0:27:15| And we don't really do growth projections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1635)|
| 0:27:18| We do enrollment projections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1638)|
| 0:27:21| We take those growth projections from the NPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1641)|
| 0:27:24| and we apply what we understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1644)|
| 0:27:27| are our enrollment trends to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1647)|
| 0:27:30| and we come up with a growth projection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1650)|
| 0:27:33| But to do something 20 years out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1653)|
| 0:27:36| would cause us to have to make a whole lot of assumptions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1656)|
| 0:27:40| to get to a number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1660)|
| 0:27:43| And that would be everything from fertility rates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1663)|
| 0:27:46| to economic assumptions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1666)|
| 0:27:49| and population shifts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1669)|
| 0:27:52| And when you're trying to do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1672)|
| 0:27:55| for a very small area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1675)|
| 0:27:58| which is a school zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1678)|
| 0:28:01| the chances of being wrong are phenomenal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1681)|
| 0:28:04| But the bigger the area you get that you're working with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1684)|
| 0:28:07| the more likely you are to do an accurate projection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1687)|
| 0:28:10| The other piece of that, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1690)|
| 0:28:13| is when we're spending money and investing in projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1693)|
| 0:28:16| we want to invest in projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1696)|
| 0:28:19| that we're going to touch right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1699)|
| 0:28:22| and that are going to affect folks right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1702)|
| 0:28:25| If we go back and we're building something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1705)|
| 0:28:28| 20 years from now, even if we get it right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1708)|
| 0:28:31| we're going through a process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1711)|
| 0:28:35| for that period of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1715)|
| 0:28:38| and we could have better invested that money now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1718)|
| 0:28:41| somewhere else and hang on to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1721)|
| 0:28:44| until we're closer to when we need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1724)|
| 0:28:47| It's as much art than science| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1727)|
| 0:28:50| when we're trying to figure out how to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1730)|
| 0:28:53| And I have something for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1733)|
| 0:28:56| I think we can continue working on conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1736)|
| 0:28:59| because we think it's a very hard day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1739)|
| 0:29:03| There's going to be a lot of kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1743)|
| 0:29:06| and it's one of these things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1746)|
| 0:29:09| that we have to be working with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1749)|
| 0:29:12| and having a conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1752)|
| 0:29:15| And all of the decisions made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1755)|
| 0:29:18| on that side of the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1758)|
| 0:29:21| haven't changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1761)|
| 0:29:24| And I think we've got a good relationship there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1764)|
| 0:29:27| We certainly don't want to do anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1767)|
| 0:29:30| to protect young adults| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1770)|
| 0:29:33| because we're trying to solve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1773)|
| 0:29:36| But we'll continue to work on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1776)|
| 0:29:49| I have a question related to the design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1789)|
| 0:29:52| I know this is not the final design of the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1792)|
| 0:29:55| but I'm curious how much your department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1795)|
| 0:29:59| influences the design of schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1799)|
| 0:30:02| especially as we move more into being trauma responsive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1802)|
| 0:30:05| and thinking about restorative practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1805)|
| 0:30:08| How much is your department influencing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1808)|
| 0:30:11| and is there going to be any designated spaces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1811)|
| 0:30:14| in the schools as we build them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1814)|
| 0:30:17| like a sensory room or something like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1817)|
| 0:30:20| Those are not called out in this design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1820)|
| 0:30:23| but I also know it's a very preliminary design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1823)|
| 0:30:26| We'll basically lay down how we go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1826)|
| 0:30:29| We'll make some tweaks to the design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1829)|
| 0:30:32| and how it goes together as we go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1832)|
| 0:30:35| But those we won't necessarily bring back to the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1835)|
| 0:30:38| unless there are major changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1838)|
| 0:30:41| We haven't specifically talked to Ms. Cook's department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1841)|
| 0:30:44| on that but we certainly can take a look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1844)|
| 0:30:47| There are some things in the design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1847)|
| 0:30:50| that we've done over the years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1850)|
| 0:30:54| to support these types of projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1854)|
| 0:31:05| Thank you Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1865)|
| 0:31:08| It's just a comment, it's not a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1868)|
| 0:31:11| I guess there are probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200902?start=1871)|
