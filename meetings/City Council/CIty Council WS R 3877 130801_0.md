| 0:00:00| It's 5.30. It's time to call this workshop to order. This is the Corridor Overlay Workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=0)|
| 0:00:08| the product of the Metropolitan Planning Commission. We have two representatives here. Vice Mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=8)|
| 0:00:15| Pavlis is not here. He's asked me to sit in for him tonight. Councilman Greve is on his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=15)|
| 0:00:20| way to his daughter's wedding, so we share in the excitement of that coming event. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=20)|
| 0:00:26| have asked Mayor Brown to lead us in the invocation, and Councilman Delavaux to lead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=26)|
| 0:00:32| us in the pledge. Dear Heavenly Father, we thank you for this, another opportunity to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=32)|
| 0:00:39| serve our city. We ask a special blessing upon each and every person assembled. We ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=39)|
| 0:00:46| that you be with those less fortunate in our city. These are the blessings we ask. Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=46)|
| 0:00:55| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=55)|
| 0:01:01| which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=61)|
| 0:01:12| Ms. Wilson, will you call the roll while we get the handouts delivered? Mayor Brown? Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=72)|
| 0:01:20| Councilman Campin? Here. Councilman Delavaux? Here. Councilman Greve? Here. Councilman Palmer? Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=80)|
| 0:01:28| Vice Mayor Pavlis? Here. Councilman Saunders? Here. Councilman Steyer? Here. Councilman Wallace? Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=88)|
| 0:01:35| All right, thank you. The purpose of this meeting is to look at a zoning ordinance amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=95)|
| 0:01:42| that would create a corridor overlay district zoning classification. We're going to start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=102)|
| 0:01:48| out with MPC making a presentation, and then we will follow that with council discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=108)|
| 0:01:55| If anybody wants to speak at public forum, you need to come up and see Ms. Wilson, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=115)|
| 0:02:00| she will invite you to sign up to do that. I think we're in the process of distributing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=120)|
| 0:02:08| the paperwork. Councilwoman Palmer? Yes, sir. I've noticed that even though Councilman Greve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=128)|
| 0:02:15| is not here, he left his light on. Well, that lets us know that he's with us in spirit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=135)|
| 0:02:24| Thank you. All right, I think we're ready to begin. Mr. Donaldson, are you the first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=144)|
| 0:02:34| banner? Yes, I am. Thank you very much. The media will be here later. Good. Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=154)|
| 0:02:44| for having this workshop. In response to whose idea was this anyway, we can trace this effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=164)|
| 0:02:53| back to former council member Bob Becker, who during the process of our updating the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=173)|
| 0:03:01| East County Sector Plan expressed a desire to expand the number of tools that were available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=181)|
| 0:03:11| to manage development along Asheville Highway. Asheville Highway is within the city limits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=191)|
| 0:03:22| all the way out to about Brakeville Road, a significant distance and a significant segment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=202)|
| 0:03:30| of Asheville Highway is in the city. Development there has been rather piecemeal and subject| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=210)|
| 0:03:39| to city and county development standards almost on a parcel by parcel basis. City limits is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=219)|
| 0:03:51| very sporadic out there. So we began talking about different tools to enhance the regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=231)|
| 0:04:00| that were in place and to more directly address the issues that were peculiar to Asheville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=240)|
| 0:04:10| Highway. And we pitched the idea of creating an overlay zone and enacting it within both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=250)|
| 0:04:17| the city and the county and developing the same sort of guidelines or standards to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=257)|
| 0:04:24| applied whether a property was within the city or the county. The idea came up again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=264)|
| 0:04:32| during our effort to update the South County Sector Plan and in particular with regard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=272)|
| 0:04:40| to Governor John Sevier Highway. Citizens out there identified a couple of parcels in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=280)|
| 0:04:48| particular that folks were a little upset with that they hadn't followed the rules that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=288)|
| 0:04:57| were in place and the rules that were in place weren't adequate. Particular properties were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=297)|
| 0:05:02| in the county but again John Sevier Highway has segments of it that are both inside the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=302)|
| 0:05:09| city and outside the city. And then it came up for a third time in discussions about improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=309)|
| 0:05:20| to Washington Pike in the northeast portion of the city. City limits extend along Washington| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=320)|
| 0:05:28| Pike all the way out to Murphy Road and there's a lot of undeveloped land and folks out in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=328)|
| 0:05:40| that area perceived the improvements to the highway as being a catalyst for new development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=340)|
| 0:05:51| and felt that the development standards were inadequate and needed to be enhanced and perhaps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=351)|
| 0:06:03| needed to be individualized to the situation at hand. And again that's an area where the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=363)|
| 0:06:11| use of an overlay can come into play. We've got a number of overlays already in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=371)|
| 0:06:19| ranging from the historic overlay districts which have a unique set of design guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=379)|
| 0:06:29| for each district that's been created and there is a historic zoning commission that has the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=389)|
| 0:06:37| authority to approve certificates of appropriateness for all applications within H1 overlays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=397)|
| 0:06:46| And we also have a neighborhood conservation overlay district organized in the same manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=406)|
| 0:06:53| We refer to it as historic light. The design guidelines are a little less strenuous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=413)|
| 0:07:04| Ann Bennett used to describe the difference as being with H1 you had to get your windows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=424)|
| 0:07:10| custom made in an NC1 you could go to a lumber supplier and actually buy them over the counter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=430)|
| 0:07:18| But again all the development applications are subject to approval by the historic zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=438)|
| 0:07:25| commission or in both H1 and NC1 there is a level of development that is approved by,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=445)|
| 0:07:34| approvable by staff. We also have an overlay for the technology corridor district out along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=454)|
| 0:07:42| Pellissippi Parkway and two of the newer overlay districts the infill housing overlay district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=462)|
| 0:07:51| and the downtown design overlay district. Infill housing and downtown design have one set of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=471)|
| 0:07:59| guidelines that are applied universally. With the downtown there is only a single district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=479)|
| 0:08:08| but we have four or five neighborhoods that are subject to the infill housing guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=488)|
| 0:08:16| all using the same same guidelines and the approvals in the case of the infill housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=496)|
| 0:08:23| are by a committee of staff members and it frankly that the people have become so accepting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=503)|
| 0:08:36| of the guidelines that we're virtually a rubber stamp and only comment on making sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=516)|
| 0:08:44| the applications are complete and offering some guidance. We've worked with the community design center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=524)|
| 0:08:53| to provide design expertise to individuals who come in through the process. So in that case the guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=533)|
| 0:09:05| have become standards and as such there's virtually no discussion, no discretion and literally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=545)|
| 0:09:17| all of the approvals are done by staff. In the downtown design guidelines there is a very specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=557)|
| 0:09:25| set of approvals that can be made by staff the balance of those are made by a review board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=565)|
| 0:09:32| When we began to draft the enabling language for this overlay we had in mind standards but we used language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=572)|
| 0:09:43| that still reflected guidelines and if you think of guidelines and standards as kind of a continuum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=583)|
| 0:09:54| guidelines are to guide a discretionary board standards are virtually are regulations that can be administered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=594)|
| 0:10:05| by staff and generally do not need the intervention of a board unless there is an appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=605)|
| 0:10:17| We had in mind drafting corridor specific design standards that could be approved by staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=617)|
| 0:10:25| subject to an applicant appealing any staff decision to the planning commission but the language that we used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=625)|
| 0:10:36| still reflected guidelines which reflects a certain amount of discretion that staff never uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=636)|
| 0:10:43| I think it's genetic if you agree to become a government worker you automatically avoid using your discretion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=643)|
| 0:10:51| whenever possible. We commonly punt those up to the planning commission or to any other board that we're working with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=651)|
| 0:11:02| But the idea is to create a corridor specific set of standards that enhance the general standards that apply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=662)|
| 0:11:13| within the zoning ordinance or any other manuals that would come into play and the idea of having a staff approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=673)|
| 0:11:25| streamlines the process for the development community and our experience with infill housing is that once people are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=685)|
| 0:11:32| used to the guidelines they accept them, they follow them, they don't argue, they look to us for guidance in applying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=692)|
| 0:11:43| the standards. Infill housing, our number one client is Habitat for Humanity and they have changed their standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=703)|
| 0:11:52| package to fit the design guidelines that were drafted so that virtually every time we see Danny Mitchell he's checking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=712)|
| 0:12:02| off the list to make sure he's got all the information on the application that's needed or correcting a font or a color| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=722)|
| 0:12:11| or something, a color of print or a line on his drawing so that we can read it. But we've gotten to the point where there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=731)|
| 0:12:19| is very little give and take as far as acceptability of the guidelines that are out there. So in review we've got a number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=739)|
| 0:12:33| of overlays already in place. We've got a number of bodies designated as the approval authorities ranging from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=753)|
| 0:12:42| Historic Zoning Commission to a committee of staff and we have guidelines that are probably in various places along that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=762)|
| 0:12:56| continuum of guidance to standard in play. Our intention with this is to move everything towards standards that are easily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=776)|
| 0:13:07| measured, easily understood and doable by staff. Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=787)|
| 0:13:19| Councilman De La Vogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=799)|
| 0:13:23| Yeah, thank you Mark. I was trying to understand the relationship as this works in a practical situation. You have the basic zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=803)|
| 0:13:34| structure including all the planning that goes behind it with sector plans and one-year plans. The guidelines or standards or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=814)|
| 0:13:44| whatever this continuum is, are they designed only to deal with appearance, placement of mechanical equipment in the backyard and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=824)|
| 0:13:53| garbage pickup and the size of the lighting and the signs and the type windows and gables and roofs? I mean is it more the appearance of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=833)|
| 0:14:00| what is being developed under whatever the zone allows? How do they work together is the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=840)|
| 0:14:06| The underlying zone would provide the permitted uses and uses permitted on review. Those would be unchanged unless an overlay could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=846)|
| 0:14:17| delete from that list, can't add to that list, but we've written it so that the uses are determined by the underlying zone and then these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=857)|
| 0:14:29| development standards, which are generally how you go about developing the property, setbacks, landscaping, parking, access management,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=869)|
| 0:14:40| signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=880)|
| 0:14:41| More than just appearance, it's appearance and functional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=881)|
| 0:14:44| Yeah, landscaping is both an appearance and a safety tool. Signs are a public information and tool that's used by the property owner and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=884)|
| 0:15:01| want to make them as aesthetic as possible. Lighting is sometimes very much an issue on corridors where they're in close proximity to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=901)|
| 0:15:14| residential development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=914)|
| 0:15:16| Brightness and whether you get glare and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=916)|
| 0:15:18| And frankly, the use of overlays could be seen as an indicator of missing pieces within your general regulations and these are kind of filling the gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=918)|
| 0:15:36| If I would be permitted, Madam Chair, if I take that over because one of the reasons this came up is we talked about it about probably a year ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=936)|
| 0:15:45| about should we have an area study for the area around Washington Pike and Millertown Pike and what's happening with all the commercial development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=945)|
| 0:15:54| and what will happen when they widen Washington Pike as they say they're planning to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=954)|
| 0:16:00| This would fit in terms of directing appearance, functionality, integration with neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=960)|
| 0:16:08| Would it at all control whether something could be commercial or not? That's purely a zoning question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=968)|
| 0:16:15| That would be a function of the underlying zoning unless there was a provision adopted in the overlay that struck some uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=975)|
| 0:16:24| That's done in some places. We haven't done that locally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=984)|
| 0:16:32| Generally, I would say that the use of the land is determined by the underlying zone and the development standards then can be enhanced through the use of the overlay and individualized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=992)|
| 0:16:46| Isn't, since that area is all in the city already, doesn't it already have an underlying zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1006)|
| 0:16:52| I mean, aren't you sort of stuck with what you've got until you change the zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1012)|
| 0:16:56| Or in the process of doing the overlay, do you also evaluate the zoning and uses that are going to happen along, say, a corridor or roadway like Washington Pike if it's four lanes or five lanes or however many lanes they're talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1016)|
| 0:17:11| That's correct. There is a zone assigned to all of the property within the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1031)|
| 0:17:18| But that road's going to be a changing factor. Do you look at that? Is the road being built? Does the corridor look at that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1038)|
| 0:17:24| How do you attack that issue to make sure that you have sort of planned use development rather than you're stuck with what you've got and you're just going to enhance its appearance or its functionality or how it meshes with adjoining uses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1044)|
| 0:17:44| Well, we use the land use plan of the sector plans as guidance for any zoning decisions that are made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1064)|
| 0:17:52| There has not been a general rezoning of the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1072)|
| 0:17:56| We generally rely on the individual property owners to bring their property through the process when they want to rather than initiating a general rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1076)|
| 0:18:09| Yeah, I just didn't know. Like I said, if you see – I mean, that was projected as a $19 million project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1089)|
| 0:18:16| It's going to be a wider road. It's going to invite some business activity unless the zoning – and some of it may be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1096)|
| 0:18:23| I'm not saying it's bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1103)|
| 0:18:25| But unless the zoning is looked at as part of the building out process so that the finished product ends up with a desirable result as opposed to an undesirable result vis-a-vis the community that lives out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1105)|
| 0:18:39| Right, and I would say that that community, when faced with the likelihood of major improvements to the road and its pending commercial development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1119)|
| 0:18:49| looked at the general development regulations that would apply and said, you know, oh, my God, perhaps we should have something better here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1129)|
| 0:18:59| And perhaps we should –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1139)|
| 0:19:00| Right, sort of anticipate this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1140)|
| 0:19:01| And perhaps we should have something that establishes this corridor as different from other corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1141)|
| 0:19:09| So through an overlay zone, we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1149)|
| 0:19:12| We can individualize the standards to a particular corridor, and we can enhance the general regulations that are in place through more robust regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1152)|
| 0:19:25| So you would use the overlay to enhance what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1165)|
| 0:19:30| Would you do sector planning or something specifically for some spot like that to see?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1170)|
| 0:19:36| Well, the process to create the corridor-specific design standards would be a fairly intensive planning process for that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1176)|
| 0:19:46| We would define the area, meet with the people, collect input to determine the look and feel that they want in that particular area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1186)|
| 0:19:56| and create a set of standards that are, you know, from them, for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1196)|
| 0:20:04| I'll yield the floor to someone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1204)|
| 0:20:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1205)|
| 0:20:06| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1206)|
| 0:20:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1207)|
| 0:20:09| Well, if I get it, the practicality of it is, is like the Beard and Business District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1209)|
| 0:20:16| It's already a formed group that does advertising and marketing on their own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1216)|
| 0:20:21| But they would come to you and say, we'd like to create this overlay district for our area, and you define it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1221)|
| 0:20:28| It's set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1228)|
| 0:20:29| The rules are set up how you get in the district or how you can, how many votes it takes to get in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1229)|
| 0:20:34| All that's kind of predetermined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1234)|
| 0:20:35| And then they can come and determine if sign height, if they wanted a particular sign height not greater than what is already there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1235)|
| 0:20:45| but it could be less, or they could determine a street lamp post.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1245)|
| 0:20:49| They could begin to set these standards for what they want their area to look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1249)|
| 0:20:54| And it could even become exclusive to their area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1254)|
| 0:20:57| They could say, no, that's our street post, and, you know, Fountain City, you can't have that, or vice versa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1257)|
| 0:21:02| So I think the individuality around this city is pretty strong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1262)|
| 0:21:08| And I think that people will, businesses and the like, will jump on the idea to customize it for their particular area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1268)|
| 0:21:17| And I think there's a lot of pride in this city, and there's a lot of pride in wherever they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1277)|
| 0:21:22| In the four corners, there is a lot of pride, and people will want it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1282)|
| 0:21:26| One of the things we've heard on, that Duane and I have heard for 18 months on sign task forces, really an overlay of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1286)|
| 0:21:35| And we have heard so much about visual clutter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1295)|
| 0:21:41| And it's probably one of the dominant themes that we continue to hear about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1301)|
| 0:21:48| And as we look at overlay zones, I think there's probably design standards that we could apply across the city that would, over the top of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1308)|
| 0:21:56| And some of those things have been, some of the biggest visual clutter complaints that we have heard over the last 18 months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1316)|
| 0:22:04| has been utility poles and utility lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1324)|
| 0:22:08| And I'm going to throw out that I think that we could come with an ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1328)|
| 0:22:14| and say that all utility lines or anything new, anything new and commercial and residential would have to go underground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1334)|
| 0:22:24| And we could set up some standards, just like what Mark's saying, across this city, to begin to develop these standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1344)|
| 0:22:31| because people will not do it on their own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1351)|
| 0:22:33| But over, I've talked to Bill Elmore about this a few weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1353)|
| 0:22:38| And he said he would estimate that 90% of new residential development in the city has underground utilities already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1358)|
| 0:22:45| But it's not a standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1365)|
| 0:22:47| Mr. Hagerman back there would say that most cases, and when we redo an intersection, we try to use mass poles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1367)|
| 0:22:56| But we don't always.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1376)|
| 0:22:58| We blow out a nice intersection, put in the sidewalks and wheelchair accessible ramps and all that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1378)|
| 0:23:04| but then we string four poles and we string lights on those poles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1384)|
| 0:23:08| We could come with ordinances that are just like what Mark's talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1388)|
| 0:23:11| but broader over the city that begin to address this kind of visual clutter and begin to set standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1391)|
| 0:23:17| Sometimes we use black mass poles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1397)|
| 0:23:19| Sometimes we use brushed metal poles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1399)|
| 0:23:24| Those are the kind of things that become visual clutter and make it really unattractive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1404)|
| 0:23:30| KUB says there, Bill Elmore says he is open to standardizing telephone poles across the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1410)|
| 0:23:36| I believe, in talking to Rob Frost, that's not something that we can create an ordinance for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1416)|
| 0:23:41| But it is something that KUB is open to and to standardize poles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1421)|
| 0:23:46| and to metal poles or wood poles or black poles or whatever, that we can standardize those things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1426)|
| 0:23:53| and begin to standardize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1433)|
| 0:23:55| There may be other things that we can come up with that are reasonable, that are practical,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1435)|
| 0:23:59| and begin to address exactly what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1439)|
| 0:24:02| And then this would even go even a little bit further into really developing the uniqueness of a particular area in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1442)|
| 0:24:11| And I think it's a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1451)|
| 0:24:13| I'm sure that there's a lot of details that we'll stumble upon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1453)|
| 0:24:19| One thing I've been impressed with since I've been in this seat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1459)|
| 0:24:22| has been the amount of pride that's in this city for each whatever corner they're in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1462)|
| 0:24:28| And I think that individuality could really be enhanced by these overlay zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1468)|
| 0:24:37| Before I come back to you, I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1477)|
| 0:24:40| You said that you had in mind that the corridor design standards would be approved by MPC staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1480)|
| 0:24:47| And if someone was not happy, they could appeal to the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1487)|
| 0:24:53| And if they're still not happy, what happens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1493)|
| 0:24:56| According to the zoning ordinance, any decision of the planning commission is appealable to the city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1496)|
| 0:25:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1505)|
| 0:25:06| Ultimately, the buck stops here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1506)|
| 0:25:08| So it would ultimately be appealable to an elected body as opposed to an appointed body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1508)|
| 0:25:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1515)|
| 0:25:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1516)|
| 0:25:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1517)|
| 0:25:18| Councilman de la Vau.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1518)|
| 0:25:19| Well, you may have addressed one of the questions I had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1519)|
| 0:25:21| because when this came before council several weeks ago before we deferred it to the workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1521)|
| 0:25:28| I was receiving comments that said, well, on some of the other overlays,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1528)|
| 0:25:32| and I noticed you gave a handout that had some of the overlays in them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1532)|
| 0:25:36| there were actual review bodies that were independent of either MPC or the council or whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1536)|
| 0:25:43| and they teamed up several either individuals or groups or, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1543)|
| 0:25:48| categories of folks that made up a review board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1548)|
| 0:25:51| and that that was the entity that kind of processed appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1551)|
| 0:25:56| And so the question that was asked of me was, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1556)|
| 0:26:00| if it's just going from staff to the planning commission, isn't the result foregone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1560)|
| 0:26:05| I mean, we don't have any different level of view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1565)|
| 0:26:07| And I think your answer was, no, there's two steps in the overlay ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1567)|
| 0:26:12| but by general law it would come to council if anyone wanted to appeal that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1572)|
| 0:26:18| Am I hearing you right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1578)|
| 0:26:20| That's basically how that would work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1580)|
| 0:26:25| I think, yeah, I think that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1585)|
| 0:26:27| Any staff decision of the planning commission is subject to appeal to the planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1587)|
| 0:26:34| and any decision of the planning commission is subject to appeal to the city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1594)|
| 0:26:38| So if there is an appeal to start that process, it could end up at city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1598)|
| 0:26:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1605)|
| 0:26:46| And in terms of the actual formation of the standards and criteria and guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1606)|
| 0:26:51| would you take a minute and just talk about how that would be done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1611)|
| 0:26:55| the kinds of hearings you would have, kinds of input you would seek, how is that supposed to work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1615)|
| 0:27:00| I mean, it sounds like a good idea to have, obviously, some standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1620)|
| 0:27:04| and guidelines to, you know, urge development in a way that's compatible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1624)|
| 0:27:11| and that has the right appearance and fits in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1631)|
| 0:27:16| As long as we don't tie people's hands too badly, they can use their own creativity to effectuate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1636)|
| 0:27:21| But how do we get to that first step of designing that set of standards and guidelines?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1641)|
| 0:27:30| We have in the past, and we propose to continue to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1650)|
| 0:27:35| to have a very intensive public participation process on the front end of development of any corridor standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1655)|
| 0:27:43| so that there is input from the property owners and adjacent neighborhoods or stakeholders going in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1663)|
| 0:27:52| so that we get agreement on what the standards will be on the front end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1672)|
| 0:27:59| So it makes it easy to apply them and to approve them upon meeting those standards on the back end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1679)|
| 0:28:09| Every time that an overlay is put in place, it will be accompanied by a study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1689)|
| 0:28:14| and a set of standards that will be adopted along with the overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1694)|
| 0:28:20| So that will be subject to a public process as well with public hearings at the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1700)|
| 0:28:27| and at the City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1707)|
| 0:28:30| Are adjustments then made by variants if there are individual problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1710)|
| 0:28:34| or is that simply something that's taken up by the staff and the MPC in some review of the application?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1714)|
| 0:28:42| In other words, what if the guidelines work generally good, but there's this crazy parcel here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1722)|
| 0:28:48| If they are adopted as standards, then they become subject to application for variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1728)|
| 0:28:57| So it could go to the BZA and then come back to staff for approval once the BZA has made a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1737)|
| 0:29:05| If it's a dimensional type or a numeric type of standard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1745)|
| 0:29:11| that it would be eligible for consideration of variance by BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1751)|
| 0:29:19| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1759)|
| 0:29:20| Councilman Stanton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1760)|
| 0:29:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1761)|
| 0:29:22| Following up on what Nick just said, and it seemed to me a memory of historic zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1762)|
| 0:29:30| one of the things we kept running into was a need, or at least in my mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1770)|
| 0:29:34| a need to review the guidelines periodically by the group, whatever the group was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1774)|
| 0:29:40| a neighborhood or a group of merchants or whatever, wherever the guidelines have been adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1780)|
| 0:29:46| Is there some mechanism to do that or some trigger that some event or some time period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1786)|
| 0:29:52| that might be suggested to review those guidelines periodically?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1792)|
| 0:29:57| We certainly could write that into any ordinance adopting the corridor standards and the overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1797)|
| 0:30:08| We're not opposed to revisiting anything at any time once we get a track record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1808)|
| 0:30:14| and see how things are working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1814)|
| 0:30:17| That's the best way to use your list of variances is to identify shortcomings in the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1817)|
| 0:30:23| and go fix them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1823)|
| 0:30:28| But with respect to the Historic Zoning Commission, that is a bit of a different creature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1828)|
| 0:30:33| in that it's enabled by state law, and the guidelines for the Historic Zoning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1833)|
| 0:30:44| are very much at the guideline end of that spectrum, and they have a lot of discretion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1844)|
| 0:30:49| as far as their application, and the appeal process is very different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1849)|
| 0:30:55| It goes to the court system rather than back to the elected body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1855)|
| 0:31:00| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1860)|
| 0:31:01| Nevertheless, those guidelines periodically, in my mind, need to be at least reviewed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1861)|
| 0:31:05| and maybe tweaked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1865)|
| 0:31:07| Circumstances change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1867)|
| 0:31:08| Materials, especially in that instance, change and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1868)|
| 0:31:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1871)|
| 0:31:13| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1873)|
| 0:31:15| Yes, I had a question about the infill housing, and you said that a lot of that is used by Habitat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1875)|
| 0:31:22| and they have guidelines in terms of setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1882)|
| 0:31:28| I have a lot of Habitat housing in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1888)|
| 0:31:32| Is that a recent thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1892)|
| 0:31:34| Because I've noticed some Habitat housing that does not have the setbacks with the rest of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1894)|
| 0:31:43| Is that a recent addition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1903)|
| 0:31:48| Well, I'm trying to visualize the boundaries of your district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1908)|
| 0:31:52| and I'm not sure that there are any infill housing overlay districts within your district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1912)|
| 0:31:57| One of the unique things about the infill housing guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1917)|
| 0:32:02| and the approval process is that the committee has the authority to grant variances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1922)|
| 0:32:09| and we use the existing housing stock to guide us there so that if there is a block of houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1929)|
| 0:32:17| that have 15-foot setbacks instead of the zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1937)|
| 0:32:23| which says you have to have a 25-foot setback,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1943)|
| 0:32:25| then we allow any new infill to meet what's already built out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1945)|
| 0:32:31| and we have the authority to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1951)|
| 0:32:34| But I don't think that there are any of the infill housing districts within your district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1954)|
| 0:32:42| So where are they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1962)|
| 0:32:44| Is this on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1964)|
| 0:32:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1965)|
| 0:32:48| The city uses the infill housing guidelines for projects that are funded by HUD, that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1968)|
| 0:32:57| So you will see examples of very good infill housing over in the Five Points area near Chestnut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1977)|
| 0:33:06| the duplexes that were built for seniors as you're coming down toward the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1986)|
| 0:33:14| So there are good examples over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1994)|
| 0:33:17| But one of the things we noticed, and you're right about some of the setbacks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=1997)|
| 0:33:20| they go back too far in some cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2000)|
| 0:33:23| and sometimes they're on a small slab to where they really don't fit next to the craftsman-style house next door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2003)|
| 0:33:30| and that was one of the reasons why we developed the guidelines to make sure that the new house mimicked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2010)|
| 0:33:37| what was already in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2017)|
| 0:33:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2020)|
| 0:33:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2021)|
| 0:33:42| The infill housing neighborhoods are Lonsdale, Oakwood, Lincoln Park, Edgewood Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2022)|
| 0:33:51| That's it, four of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2031)|
| 0:33:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2034)|
| 0:33:55| One question I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2035)|
| 0:33:57| When we talk about a corridor, lots of different things come to mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2037)|
| 0:34:01| Could you identify some corridors where you anticipate if this comes to life this would be used?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2041)|
| 0:34:11| Well, the three that I mentioned, and Clinton Highway is always on the top of our mind as far as enhancement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2051)|
| 0:34:22| That's a good term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2062)|
| 0:34:25| That's probably the next most obvious one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2065)|
| 0:34:28| and we plan on starting the northwest city sector plan update fairly soon in the next fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2068)|
| 0:34:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2081)|
| 0:34:42| What about any others that come to mind, or are some of them so far along that it's too late?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2082)|
| 0:34:48| Well, I don't know that it's ever too late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2088)|
| 0:34:53| The guidelines can, in fact, be a catalyst for redevelopment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2093)|
| 0:34:59| if people feel that they're enhancing the quality of the environment that would result.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2099)|
| 0:35:08| Well, I'm thinking about Western Avenue as being widened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2108)|
| 0:35:11| The five lanes will be finished in about a year and a half,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2111)|
| 0:35:15| and there are some fairly expansive areas that are not developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2115)|
| 0:35:21| and then there are some that need attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2121)|
| 0:35:25| Yeah, I would think that segments of Western would, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2125)|
| 0:35:29| if we could get people thinking and acting together, it could be enhanced by an overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2129)|
| 0:35:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2137)|
| 0:35:38| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2138)|
| 0:35:39| Yeah, I mean, following up on your remarks, all the corridor improvement plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2139)|
| 0:35:45| certainly Chapman Highway in my mind would be a great area to be considered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2145)|
| 0:35:51| not from the top down but from the merchants themselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2151)|
| 0:35:55| and there's already an improvement plan for that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2155)|
| 0:35:59| This may be something that could enhance it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2159)|
| 0:36:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2162)|
| 0:36:03| I see the applicability on all those major corridors and some not so major.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2163)|
| 0:36:08| And this, the Chapman Highway corridor plan hinted at this kind of tool as an overlay in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2168)|
| 0:36:16| So we already have some direction to begin to head to a corridor overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2176)|
| 0:36:21| And another tool that we have to be used is what we call the forum districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2181)|
| 0:36:29| that we've applied to the Cumberland Corridor and to the South Waterfront,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2189)|
| 0:36:35| which are basically overlays on steroids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2195)|
| 0:36:42| Very regimented in the type of design that will be done there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2202)|
| 0:36:49| But again, with a very heavy planning process on the front end to get buy-in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2209)|
| 0:36:55| and acceptance by everybody involved as to what the standards should be so that it becomes easier on the back end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2215)|
| 0:37:02| to go through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2222)|
| 0:37:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2224)|
| 0:37:05| Councilman Serra.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2225)|
| 0:37:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2226)|
| 0:37:07| It seems like we've been talking about pretty major streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2227)|
| 0:37:12| Would it be also used for something like Sutherland Avenue or Central Avenue or something that small?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2232)|
| 0:37:18| It could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2238)|
| 0:37:19| Sutherland has a fairly unique character to it that's different than other corridors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2239)|
| 0:37:26| and yet has the same mix of zone districts that apply there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2246)|
| 0:37:30| So, yeah, at that level, I would think an overlay could be very effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2250)|
| 0:37:38| And I guess the main point of it is that unlike the other overlays, which are the same,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2258)|
| 0:37:46| each overlay would be different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2266)|
| 0:37:49| Unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2269)|
| 0:37:50| Unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2270)|
| 0:37:51| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2271)|
| 0:37:52| So you could have one for Sutherland that would be very different from Clinton Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2272)|
| 0:37:56| or Chapman Highway or Magnolia or Kingston Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2276)|
| 0:37:59| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2279)|
| 0:38:00| We could create a set of standards for Sutherland whereby all new development looked either like dead-end barbecue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2280)|
| 0:38:06| or Civelli's instead of a typical big box or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2286)|
| 0:38:13| So you can deal with scale as well as design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2293)|
| 0:38:18| And on such a corridor as Sutherland, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2298)|
| 0:38:21| there's a principle that the size of the sign is somewhat dependent on the speed of travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2301)|
| 0:38:28| So for Asheville Highway, you'd have a much larger, if they wanted to go monument signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2308)|
| 0:38:35| as opposed to a Sutherland where you're going 30, 35 miles an hour| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2315)|
| 0:38:39| and you're going to be able to see a smaller sign and get the identity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2319)|
| 0:38:42| That's just an example of the kind of difference you might see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2322)|
| 0:38:45| And in terms of what we need to do, I mean, we're just going to allow this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2325)|
| 0:38:49| but then each corridor would have to come up with its own standards or guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2329)|
| 0:38:55| And that's where the rubber really meets the road in terms of affecting property owners' rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2335)|
| 0:39:02| to do different things with their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2342)|
| 0:39:06| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2346)|
| 0:39:07| And the one handout that's Burlington, North Carolina,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2347)|
| 0:39:11| it's one of these specific corridors that they have over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2351)|
| 0:39:16| And as you just thumb through it, you can see that everything's measurable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2356)|
| 0:39:21| The signs, the lighting standards are by foot candles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2361)|
| 0:39:27| There's a cutoff for the luminaires so you have a dark sky effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2367)|
| 0:39:34| But that's just an example we wanted to share with you that would be somewhat similar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2374)|
| 0:39:39| for certain corridors that we might ultimately be asked to look into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2379)|
| 0:39:45| But in terms of the near future, we're not going to have to decide, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2385)|
| 0:39:48| for corridor overlays this is going to be the lights are going to look like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2388)|
| 0:39:53| sign's going to be this big or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2393)|
| 0:39:56| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2396)|
| 0:39:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2397)|
| 0:39:58| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2398)|
| 0:39:59| Yeah, because it's more of a voluntary thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2399)|
| 0:40:02| They get together and decide, you know, the group, the community would decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2402)|
| 0:40:05| on what those standards would be like for Sutherland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2405)|
| 0:40:08| I mean, they'd form a, let's say, a Sutherland Avenue Business Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2408)|
| 0:40:12| They come together and they're going to go, this is what we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2412)|
| 0:40:14| They hash it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2414)|
| 0:40:16| And they bring it to us and say, here's what we've decided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2416)|
| 0:40:19| We want the standards to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2419)|
| 0:40:20| We want this, this, and this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2420)|
| 0:40:22| And there'll be, you know, I guess he's got rules in there of how you vote in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2422)|
| 0:40:26| if someone says, well, I don't want to be a part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2426)|
| 0:40:28| But, you know, if so many, there's a way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2428)|
| 0:40:31| He's got rules for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2431)|
| 0:40:34| Again, I think people really have a lot of pride in their area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2434)|
| 0:40:37| And I think it's something that they'll do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2437)|
| 0:40:38| It's kind of a grassroots up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2438)|
| 0:40:40| It's not top down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2440)|
| 0:40:41| It's just giving them the platform to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2441)|
| 0:40:43| So, anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2443)|
| 0:40:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2445)|
| 0:40:46| Councilman Dellavaux.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2446)|
| 0:40:47| Yeah, I may be confused by that last set of remarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2447)|
| 0:40:51| In the thing they handed out, the AIS or information package we got on June 11th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2451)|
| 0:40:57| that draft talked about how you create or modify an overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2457)|
| 0:41:02| And it said it could be initiated by the city council or the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2462)|
| 0:41:06| I guess asking MPC to do certain things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2466)|
| 0:41:09| or alternatively 51 percent of the owners in the district could initiate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2469)|
| 0:41:14| Once that trigger is pulled, it looks like MPC does the studies, the hearings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2474)|
| 0:41:19| comes up with a background study and report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2479)|
| 0:41:22| And then I guess it becomes fodder for an ordinance, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2482)|
| 0:41:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2487)|
| 0:41:28| Adopting the end product as proposed through MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2488)|
| 0:41:31| Isn't that the way you're planning to do each corridor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2491)|
| 0:41:35| In other words, it gets initiated by somebody, whether it's the administration, the council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2495)|
| 0:41:40| the business or property owners, but eventually it goes through a planning design review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2500)|
| 0:41:45| It comes up as a recommendation for an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2505)|
| 0:41:48| Is that fair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2508)|
| 0:41:49| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2509)|
| 0:41:50| Only city council can change the zoning map or amend the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2510)|
| 0:41:55| But this provides the path to initiate those requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2515)|
| 0:42:01| Not just the zoning ordinance, but also the overlay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2521)|
| 0:42:04| or is that you consider that part of the zoning ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2524)|
| 0:42:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2526)|
| 0:42:07| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2527)|
| 0:42:08| In changing the map, you would be adopting these standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2528)|
| 0:42:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2531)|
| 0:42:12| So it comes with formal approval at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2532)|
| 0:42:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2535)|
| 0:42:16| I have a question concerning cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2536)|
| 0:42:21| Everything comes with a price tag, good, bad or ugly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2541)|
| 0:42:25| Is this going to create an additional cost for somebody who wants to develop a parcel of property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2545)|
| 0:42:33| Kind of give me an idea where we're going with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2553)|
| 0:42:40| It certainly could result in costs that would be greater than the absence of any standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2560)|
| 0:42:51| Good answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2571)|
| 0:42:52| Hard to argue with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2572)|
| 0:42:56| On the administrative side, the planning commission gets involved in creating guidelines and standards anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2576)|
| 0:43:05| and this path that we've described with staff approval would be less costly than managing a board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2585)|
| 0:43:18| or a committee to do the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2598)|
| 0:43:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2601)|
| 0:43:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2602)|
| 0:43:24| Oh, Councilman de la Vau.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2604)|
| 0:43:26| Yeah, just one more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2606)|
| 0:43:27| You handed out at the beginning of this meeting the Burlington, North Carolina zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2607)|
| 0:43:32| I guess, as an example of maybe somebody's corridor project, the Western Loop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2612)|
| 0:43:38| In that first segment, the general requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2618)|
| 0:43:41| how do you make a decision about whether someone, if we do our own ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2621)|
| 0:43:46| is subject to the guidelines where they're doing, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2626)|
| 0:43:51| a major modification of the building or a minor one or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2631)|
| 0:43:54| At some point, if you tinker enough with what you have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2634)|
| 0:43:58| you may not be grandfathered such that you should comply with the guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2638)|
| 0:44:02| at least for the new portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2642)|
| 0:44:03| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2643)|
| 0:44:04| How are you going to deal with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2644)|
| 0:44:06| You know, a raw piece of land, it's easy to understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2646)|
| 0:44:08| How do you deal with existing structures, businesses, whatever?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2648)|
| 0:44:12| Yeah, there would be an applicability paragraph as part of the standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2652)|
| 0:44:17| and a description of what those various triggers are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2657)|
| 0:44:21| We've kind of fallen into a rhythm on other efforts of a 50% increase in area or value or a 50%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2661)|
| 0:44:33| So major changes, in other words, significant changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2673)|
| 0:44:35| Yeah, some threshold of major.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2675)|
| 0:44:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2678)|
| 0:44:39| All right, council members, do we want to have any more discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2679)|
| 0:44:41| or are we ready for public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2681)|
| 0:44:44| Public forum is fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2684)|
| 0:44:45| All right, public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2685)|
| 0:44:46| And we have one person, Kevin Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2686)|
| 0:44:49| State your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2689)|
| 0:44:52| Thank you, Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2692)|
| 0:44:53| Kevin Murphy, 4508 Murphy Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2693)|
| 0:44:56| I'm one of the them that was referred to out there in the Washington Pike area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2696)|
| 0:45:00| and I think all of you know me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2700)|
| 0:45:02| I just wanted to say that I think this is a really very positive development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2702)|
| 0:45:06| This is a powerful tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2706)|
| 0:45:08| This is pretty useful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2708)|
| 0:45:11| And I know I'm speaking on behalf of the Alice Bell representatives and leadership out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2711)|
| 0:45:16| This is something that I know that they would very much like to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2716)|
| 0:45:20| It's a tool that could be very useful as we're looking at the impacts of widening Washington Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2720)|
| 0:45:25| and what happens to that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2725)|
| 0:45:27| So I like a lot of what I see there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2727)|
| 0:45:30| I like the way that it's being written as guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2730)|
| 0:45:33| It looks like it's reasonably lightweight to administer in terms of requiring a certificate of appropriateness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2733)|
| 0:45:38| So that's a positive thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2738)|
| 0:45:40| So I think there's a lot of stuff to like about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2740)|
| 0:45:44| So I know this will help us be some good conversations that we can have with council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2744)|
| 0:45:48| and with Mr. Massey and Mr. Hagerman as we're working through the Washington Pike widening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2748)|
| 0:45:54| One thing that I'm also going to try and that I'm going to make a commitment to you is I'm trying to carry some water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2754)|
| 0:46:00| with the county commission side as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2760)|
| 0:46:02| The county commission is also a little bit involved with the widening project out there or should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2762)|
| 0:46:08| I know that Mayor O'Hara met with Mayor Burchett, but after that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2768)|
| 0:46:13| the county commission and county involvement got dropped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2773)|
| 0:46:16| And so one of the interesting things is this ordinance applies to the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2776)|
| 0:46:20| but there's areas where as the corridor goes out, you bump up against the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2780)|
| 0:46:24| I think a great example would be if you did adopt a corridor out along Washington Pike to Murphy Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2784)|
| 0:46:31| in front of the city property there, it's sort of interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2791)|
| 0:46:34| The corridor would apply to the city property that's across the street from me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2794)|
| 0:46:38| but it wouldn't apply to my own property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2798)|
| 0:46:40| And that doesn't seem really fair because actually I don't think that if the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2800)|
| 0:46:44| and the planning commission go through the effort of putting a corridor in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2804)|
| 0:46:47| that it should only apply to one side of the street and then I could sell off a piece of the farm there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2807)|
| 0:46:52| and develop a shopping center that was much more egregious and such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2812)|
| 0:46:57| I will speak with Commissioner Broyles and Commissioner Wright on the county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2817)|
| 0:47:01| and Mayor Burchett and ask them if we can try and get this adopted there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2821)|
| 0:47:05| I don't know if being on the County Board of Zoning Appeals myself will help me with influence there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2825)|
| 0:47:10| but I'll at least try that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2830)|
| 0:47:12| So that's a commitment that I'll make to you, and I support this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2832)|
| 0:47:15| and really appreciate your attention on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2835)|
| 0:47:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2837)|
| 0:47:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2838)|
| 0:47:20| Councilman de la Vogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2840)|
| 0:47:21| Could Mark tell us if you've been doing any work with the county on a comparable overlay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2841)|
| 0:47:26| We have had discussions with county staff about it, but we haven't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2846)|
| 0:47:30| We've actually drafted it, but we haven't gone through a process to bring it forward yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2850)|
| 0:47:34| We're trying to get you guys out front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2854)|
| 0:47:37| But it speaks to one really effective way that this can link a corridor together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2857)|
| 0:47:45| despite its disparate allegiances to city or county, and all of our corridors are like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2865)|
| 0:47:52| There are outlots that aren't within the city on virtually every corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2872)|
| 0:47:58| and subject to entirely different general development regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877130801?start=2878)|
