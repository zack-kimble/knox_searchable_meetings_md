| 1:55:29| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6929)|
| 1:55:31| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6931)|
| 1:55:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6933)|
| 1:55:35| Could you come forward, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6935)|
| 1:55:46| Mr. Chase, thank you for coming today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6946)|
| 1:55:48| I just wanted you to describe what your intent was, what you plan on doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6948)|
| 1:55:54| why you wanted to go through the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6954)|
| 1:55:56| If I could, sir, apologize, but please state your name for the record and your address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6956)|
| 1:56:01| Sir, my name is Brian Chase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6961)|
| 1:56:03| I live at 8153 Pillow Road, the location of the request for rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6963)|
| 1:56:10| And currently the property is zoned low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6970)|
| 1:56:16| It's 1.03 or I'm sorry, 1.05 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6976)|
| 1:56:21| And we would like to have it rezoned as agricultural so that we may have a small chicken coop to supplement my income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6981)|
| 1:56:30| I work as a professional firefighter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6990)|
| 1:56:33| And I'm supporting a family of four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6993)|
| 1:56:36| So we don't have a whole lot of income there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=6996)|
| 1:56:40| And the chicken coop will be used to supplement our income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=7000)|
| 1:56:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=7007)|
| 1:56:48| Yeah, that was my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=7008)|
| 1:56:49| Sometimes agricultural uses are made or applications are made and the intent is not we wonder about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=7009)|
| 1:56:58| We had an issue today about agricultural use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=7018)|
| 1:57:01| So that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=7021)|
| 1:57:04| And I appreciate you coming forward with us and explaining that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=7024)|
| 1:57:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=7027)|
| 1:57:08| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=7028)|
| 1:57:09| When we were reviewing the zoning and this possibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=7029)|
| 1:57:12| it came to my attention that the low-density residential was not approved for having any kind of livestock whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=7032)|
| 1:57:20| And we wanted to request the rezoning just to make sure we were within the limits of the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=7040)|
| 1:57:29| Motion is to approve per Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=7049)|
| 1:57:32| Yeah, I just wanted to, I plan on voting for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=7052)|
| 1:57:36| I think we should all vote for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=7056)|
| 1:57:38| But I also wanted to ask MPC if they might possibly look into maybe some relaxing of some of these rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=7058)|
| 1:57:46| I mean, I understand where you wouldn't want a full hatchery at a location in the middle of a neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=7066)|
| 1:57:53| But as times get tough and as folks go more toward a green lifestyle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=7073)|
| 1:58:00| I think we're going to have more people on their personal lots that are going to want to have free-range eggs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=7080)|
| 1:58:08| free-range chickens that they raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=7088)|
| 1:58:10| If you all could look into this, if maybe we could have something that would be less than a full hatchery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=7090)|
| 1:58:17| But, you know, if you can have a dog, why not a couple of chickens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=7097)|
| 1:58:24| They're not fighting roosters, are they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=7104)|
| 1:58:27| Motion before us to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=7107)|
| 1:58:29| We've got some more lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=7109)|
| 1:58:31| I just had a question for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=7111)|
| 1:58:32| Do you work for the city fire department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=7112)|
| 1:58:34| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=7114)|
| 1:58:35| I work for the city of Oak Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=7115)|
| 1:58:37| Do you have your chickens already?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=7117)|
| 1:58:38| No, I do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=7118)|
| 1:58:39| I've got a friend of mine that's got some, so see me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=7119)|
| 1:58:44| Mr. Boyles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=7124)|
| 1:58:45| Yes, this is an issue that actually city council has been working on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=7125)|
| 1:58:49| on an ordinance to allow backyard poultry operations so people can raise chickens, laying hens for eggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part2?start=7129)|
