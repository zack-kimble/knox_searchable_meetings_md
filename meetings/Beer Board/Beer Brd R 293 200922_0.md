| 0:02:14| Yes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=134)|
| 0:02:17| I don't believe Councilwoman Fugate has joined us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=137)|
| 0:02:20| She won't be joining us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=140)|
| 0:02:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=141)|
| 0:02:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=143)|
| 0:02:25| Well, we have 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=145)|
| 0:02:27| Before we get started, I've got a few announcements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=147)|
| 0:02:29| So tonight we have 15 beer permit applications before us, as well as two other items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=149)|
| 0:02:36| As you can see, today's meeting, like our meeting in August, is being held on Zoom, and that will make things a little different for us than we've been experiencing here in this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=156)|
| 0:02:46| When I call the names of businesses applying for permits, please raise your hand in the Zoom session to speak or dial star 9 on your phone and dial star 6 to mute or unmute yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=166)|
| 0:03:00| When called on, please state your name and address clearly for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=180)|
| 0:03:05| Applicants who are approved pending final documentation will need to bring their completed documents to the Business Tax Office tomorrow during normal business hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=185)|
| 0:03:15| Applicants that have their, I'm sorry, since I'm chairing the meeting, other members will be making motions in the Second District on my behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=195)|
| 0:03:25| Because our meeting is being held on Zoom, as you've already seen, each vote will have to be taken as a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=205)|
| 0:03:32| So let's go ahead and get started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=212)|
| 0:03:35| I had received notice, Mr. Byrd, that items 4A, 4B, 4C, 4D, 4E, 4F, and 4N have all requested to be postponed to the October 20th meeting because they lacked their fingerprints and background checks. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=215)|
| 0:03:59| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=239)|
| 0:04:00| And Sergeant Coward, do all of those agenda items lack their fingerprints and background checks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=240)|
| 0:04:08| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=248)|
| 0:04:10| Okay. So seeing that none of them have those in, deferment to or postponement to the October 20th meeting is in order. So I would entertain a motion to postpone to the October 20th meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=250)|
| 0:04:23| I'll make a motion to postpone to the October meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=263)|
| 0:04:27| Okay. Do I have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=267)|
| 0:04:28| I have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=268)|
| 0:04:30| I think I heard Mr. Smith with a second. So I have a motion and a second. Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=270)|
| 0:04:35| All right. Hearing none, Mr. Johnson, please make a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=275)|

| 0:05:20| Yes. I'm enabling him to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=320)|

| 0:05:37| No record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=337)|

| 0:22:09| And the other thing we heard from Mr. Byrd was that you're missing your sales tax registration, and you need building inspection as well as health department approvals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=1329)|
| 0:22:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=1335)|

| 0:22:25| Health department is already approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=1345)|
| 0:22:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=1347)|

| 0:22:31| Which one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=1351)|

| 0:22:39| Let me see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=1359)|
| 0:22:41| Do we approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=1361)|
| 0:22:43| We have a certificate of excellence from Department of State.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=1363)|
| 0:22:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=1367)|
| 0:22:49| Is that a building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=1369)|
| 0:22:51| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=1371)|

| 0:22:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=1377)|
| 0:22:59| I've got a question from one of our councilmembers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=1379)|
| 0:23:01| Councilmember Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=1381)|
| 0:23:03| I just want a clarification from Mr. Byrd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=1383)|
| 0:23:05| In the packet, there is something from Timothy Huddleston from the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=1385)|
| 0:23:09| It says 8851 Town and Country Circle, Q Korean Steakhouse, barbecue, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=1389)|
| 0:23:13| Approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=1393)|
| 0:23:15| What department or what approval is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=1395)|
| 0:23:17| Because it doesn't clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=1397)|
| 0:23:19| Let me double check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=1399)|
| 0:23:21| That, I believe, is fire prevention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=1401)|
| 0:23:23| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=1403)|
| 0:23:25| That's fire prevention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=1405)|
| 0:23:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=1407)|
| 0:23:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=1409)|
| 0:23:31| Thank you for clarifying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=1411)|
| 0:23:33| So which items are we missing, Mr. Byrd, again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=1413)|
| 0:23:35| The copy of the sales tax registration and approval from the building inspections department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=1415)|
| 0:23:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=1417)|
| 0:23:39| So you still need your sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=1419)|
| 0:23:41| You still need your building inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=1421)|

| 0:28:19| I know some of us who have been on beer board in previous years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=1699)|
| 0:28:21| have done these before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=1701)|

| 0:28:41| and these are the first ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=1721)|
| 0:28:43| in quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=1723)|
| 0:28:45| Because of the pandemic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=1725)|
| 0:28:47| KPD was not conducting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=1727)|

| 0:28:55| up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=1735)|
| 0:28:57| So, what you all have in front of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=1737)|
| 0:28:59| are two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=1739)|

| 0:29:03| Each of these businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=1743)|
| 0:29:05| has had two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=1745)|
| 0:29:07| underage sales| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=1747)|

| 0:29:11| two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=1751)|

| 0:29:17| within the past two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=1757)|
| 0:29:19| So, at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=1759)|
| 0:29:21| they have paid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=1761)|
| 0:29:23| each of them have paid a $500| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=1763)|
| 0:29:25| fine, and each of them have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=1765)|
| 0:29:27| submitted a remedial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=1767)|
| 0:29:29| plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=1769)|
| 0:29:31| The representative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=1771)|
| 0:29:33| for each of these businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=1773)|
| 0:29:35| to speak and explain the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=1775)|
| 0:29:37| situation and how they are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=1777)|
| 0:29:39| going to take corrective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=1779)|
| 0:29:41| actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=1781)|
| 0:29:43| Then you all have two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=1783)|
| 0:29:45| choices to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=1785)|
| 0:29:47| If you believe that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=1787)|
| 0:29:49| their explanation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=1789)|

| 0:29:53| remedial plan is adequate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=1793)|
| 0:29:55| then it ends tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=1795)|
| 0:29:57| However, if they pick up a third| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=1797)|
| 0:29:59| violation within the two-year period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=1799)|
| 0:30:01| then they go straight to the hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=1801)|
| 0:30:03| If tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=1803)|
| 0:30:05| one of the businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=1805)|
| 0:30:07| you all remain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=1807)|

| 0:30:13| correct the situation, then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=1813)|
| 0:30:15| you would need to make a motion to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=1815)|
| 0:30:17| refer them to the hearing officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=1817)|

| 0:32:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=1971)|

| 0:33:02| Councilperson Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=1982)|
| 0:33:03| I apologize, I didn't catch the speaker's name from the gentleman speaking on behalf| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=1983)|
| 0:33:12| of the restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=1992)|

| 0:33:14| Mr. Nava.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=1994)|
| 0:33:15| Mr. Nava.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=1995)|
| 0:33:16| Sorry, we have an echo here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=1996)|
| 0:33:17| When you say you had somebody from the ABC class come in, did they come in and do all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=1997)|
| 0:33:29| of your staff together?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2009)|
| 0:33:31| Did you guys do a group class?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2011)|
| 0:33:36| Well, it was a group class for all the, like, locations, so they were there from the locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2016)|
| 0:33:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2023)|
| 0:33:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2024)|
| 0:33:45| And, yeah, they, like, talk about it and, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2025)|
| 0:33:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2030)|
| 0:33:51| So you do understand that if you have multiple citations, you can lose your license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2031)|
| 0:34:00| Is that correct, Mr. Frost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2040)|
| 0:34:03| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2043)|
| 0:34:09| If he has another citation in a rolling two-year period, then he'll be automatically sent for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2049)|
| 0:34:15| a suspension revocation hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2055)|
| 0:34:18| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2058)|
| 0:34:20| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2060)|
| 0:34:21| I just, we just want to make sure that you understand the importance and the severity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2061)|
| 0:34:27| of serving to minors and the importance of making sure all your staff are trained and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2067)|
| 0:34:33| aware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2073)|
| 0:34:34| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2074)|
| 0:34:35| We understand that, and that's why we're trying to do our best, like, having meetings every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2075)|
| 0:34:42| day and showing them videos, like, on how to do it and just trying to train them the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2082)|
| 0:34:48| best we can because we want to stay in business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2088)|
| 0:34:52| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2092)|
| 0:34:54| And we would like for that to happen, and we would like for minors not to be served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2094)|
| 0:35:00| Some restaurants have made it so that the dates have to be entered into the cash register| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2100)|
| 0:35:06| or they have to be verified by the bartender before the drink is actually filled and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2106)|
| 0:35:13| order is filled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2113)|
| 0:35:16| Did they go through those types of steps with you in the ABC class?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2116)|
| 0:35:19| I'm not familiar because I haven't taken the class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2119)|
| 0:35:22| Mr. Coward might be able to comment on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2122)|
| 0:35:24| Well, the only thing I know of is, like, a SafeServe app.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2124)|
| 0:35:33| We scan the ID, and it, like, says if it's approved or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2133)|
| 0:35:38| But that's, like, we have an iPod, and they can check it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2138)|
| 0:35:43| But I don't know if there's, like, another better app to do it or, like, a scanner to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2143)|
| 0:35:47| scan the ID and just, like, make sure it's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2147)|
| 0:35:51| But, yeah, the SafeServe is the only one we use right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2151)|
| 0:35:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2154)|
| 0:35:55| I'll let other members ask questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2155)|
| 0:35:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2158)|
| 0:35:59| I've got a question from Councilperson Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2159)|
| 0:36:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2163)|
| 0:36:06| I had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2166)|
| 0:36:07| I think we got a report that in the case of Amigos, they sold to an underage person but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2167)|
| 0:36:18| did not check the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2178)|
| 0:36:20| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2180)|
| 0:36:21| It's a separate issue, that report that was sent to us on August 26th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2181)|
| 0:36:30| I've got it on the tape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2190)|
| 0:36:31| Is it the same citation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2191)|
| 0:36:32| Sergeant Coward, are you looking up the record for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2192)|
| 0:36:33| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2193)|
| 0:36:34| You're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2194)|
| 0:36:35| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2195)|
| 0:36:36| You're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2196)|
| 0:36:37| August 26th, 2020, cited for sale to the minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2197)|
| 0:36:41| That was a second in a rolling two-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2201)|
| 0:36:44| Sergeant Coward, you got anything else to offer us this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2204)|
| 0:36:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2206)|
| 0:36:47| I'm looking at the citation, and the defendant did not check ID prior to the sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2207)|
| 0:36:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2215)|
| 0:36:56| So, I just wanted to ask if there's a policy that you have in place for your servers to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2216)|
| 0:37:05| check all IDs regardless of what age they may look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2225)|
| 0:37:10| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2230)|
| 0:37:11| I don't know if you have a copy of our policy, but, yeah, we're supposed to, like, ID everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2231)|
| 0:37:18| and, like, we make them sign the policy, like, whenever they start working there, to, like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2238)|
| 0:37:25| ID everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2245)|
| 0:37:26| I mean, I know we can, like, and, like, we have them terminated whenever they do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2246)|
| 0:37:36| but, I mean, it's just, like...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2256)|
| 0:37:40| Were there consequences for this server who did not check an ID?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2260)|
| 0:37:46| On our part, they're no longer working here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2266)|
| 0:37:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2269)|
| 0:37:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2270)|
| 0:37:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2271)|
| 0:37:52| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2272)|
| 0:37:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2273)|
| 0:37:54| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2274)|
| 0:37:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2275)|
| 0:37:56| I saw a question from Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2276)|
| 0:37:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2278)|
| 0:37:59| Sergeant Coward, I noticed on the report that we have that Mr. Nava checked that they do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2279)|
| 0:38:06| not have an in-house compliance check in addition to KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2286)|
| 0:38:10| Is there...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2290)|
| 0:38:11| Can you give an example of maybe best-in-class process for in-house compliance checking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2291)|
| 0:38:20| Well, if someone wants to do an in-house compliance check, they would need to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2300)|
| 0:38:31| It would need to be supervised by the company's management or ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2311)|
| 0:38:39| They would also need to supply their own underage individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2319)|
| 0:38:45| If they choose, they can reach out to me, and I will help them set up and show them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2325)|
| 0:38:55| what they need to do as far as doing their own in-house compliance checks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2335)|
| 0:39:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2341)|
| 0:39:02| Mr. Nava, given this is the second situation in two years, it might be good to have Sergeant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2342)|
| 0:39:07| Coward or KPD offer some advice on in-house compliance to test it yourselves so that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2347)|
| 0:39:14| there's not a third issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2354)|
| 0:39:15| It seems like you have pretty good regular procedures, but that extra layer of oversight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2355)|
| 0:39:21| might be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2361)|
| 0:39:22| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2362)|
| 0:39:23| Now, is there a number I can have so I can talk to him about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2363)|
| 0:39:29| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2369)|

| 0:39:34| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2374)|
| 0:39:35| And we're trying to do, like, our best to, like, not have this happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2375)|

| 0:40:08| in addition to everything that you guys are doing every day, and it sounds like you are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2408)|
| 0:40:12| putting forth your best effort, you still have these two citations within a roll into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2412)|
| 0:40:18| your period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2418)|

| 0:40:25| I think that if I were you, I would consider using that on a more regular basis, as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2425)|
| 0:40:31| as your own compliance checks, because, again, these are very serious offenses, and we just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2431)|
| 0:40:38| want to make sure that you guys are taking advantage of every option that you have available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2438)|

| 0:41:06| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2466)|
| 0:41:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2467)|
| 0:41:08| So, seeing no more discussion or questions, our options are to refer...to have a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2468)|
| 0:41:18| to refer for a suspension revocation hearing, or in the alternative, take no action, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2478)|
| 0:41:24| in which case, no one will make any motions, and if they get another offense, they automatically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2484)|
| 0:41:29| go to a suspension revocation hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2489)|
| 0:41:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2495)|
| 0:41:37| I'm not seeing any motions or any activity, so I'll take that as we're going to move on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2497)|
| 0:41:42| to the next one and take no...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2502)|
| 0:41:43| Oh, I do have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2503)|
| 0:41:45| I just was going to echo, please reach out to Mr. Coward so you guys can have a check| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2505)|
| 0:41:52| over and employ some best practices, and they can look at things for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2512)|
| 0:41:57| Yes, we will do that, definitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2517)|
| 0:42:00| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2520)|
| 0:42:01| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2521)|
| 0:42:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2522)|
| 0:42:03| Any other motions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2523)|
| 0:42:04| And I don't...we're just not going to take any action on item 5A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2524)|
| 0:42:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2529)|
| 0:42:11| Moving on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2531)|
| 0:42:12| Item 5B, Limb Dynasty Asia Café.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2532)|
| 0:42:17| Do we have somebody with us from Limb Dynasty Asian Café, or Asia Café?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2537)|
| 0:42:26| Yes, I've enabled Mr. Limb to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2546)|
| 0:42:29| He needs to unmute himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2549)|
| 0:42:32| Mr. Limb, are you with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2552)|
| 0:42:47| Mr. Limb, are you with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2567)|
| 0:42:52| He is unmuted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2572)|
| 0:43:00| Limb Dynasty Asia Café, can you give us your name and address, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2580)|
| 0:43:25| We cannot hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2605)|
| 0:43:28| So I'm going to...Mr. Johnson, can you keep saying if you can...if you get someone to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2608)|
| 0:43:35| appear for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2615)|
| 0:43:36| I'm going to continue talking about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2616)|
| 0:43:38| So in this particular item, you'll see in your agenda, board members, we have a citation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2618)|
| 0:43:45| in January of 2020 for sale to a minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2625)|
| 0:43:48| That was the first offense in a two-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2628)|
| 0:43:51| We received a remedial plan in January of 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2631)|
| 0:43:56| In August, August the 26th of 2020, cited for a sale to a minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2636)|
| 0:44:01| This was the second in a two-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2641)|
| 0:44:03| They received notice of the hearing on August the 31st, and we received a...their fine and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2643)|
| 0:44:10| their remedial plan on September 4th, which you see in your packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2650)|
| 0:44:17| I have a question for Sergeant Coward while we're waiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2657)|
| 0:44:23| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2663)|
| 0:44:24| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2664)|
| 0:44:26| I was just wondering, with our reports, we can see whether there's been an ID check or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2666)|
| 0:44:35| not, but I don't think the report tells us if the...if there was a fake ID used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2675)|
| 0:44:43| We cannot use fake IDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2683)|
| 0:44:46| State law requires us to use their real driver's license, and we can't do anything designed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2686)|
| 0:44:55| to trick or, you know, the...if the cadet is asked any question about their age, they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2695)|
| 0:45:03| are required to answer truthfully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2703)|
| 0:45:06| So they did use their...well, they had their correct IDs, however, in both circumstances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2706)|
| 0:45:17| the January and the August compliance checks, the exact same person was caught, and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2717)|
| 0:45:28| server in question did not card either cadet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2728)|
| 0:45:32| I think...well, I think the August report, it says age...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2732)|
| 0:45:39| Actually, they did...let me double check that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2739)|
| 0:45:44| Gosh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2744)|
| 0:45:45| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2745)|
| 0:45:46| I had forgotten that it's always a cadet, and it's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2746)|
| 0:45:51| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2751)|
| 0:45:52| On both of them, she did check the ID prior to the sale, but it...like I said, it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2752)|
| 0:46:00| the same server who served both times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2760)|
| 0:46:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2765)|
| 0:46:07| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2767)|
| 0:46:08| Yes, are you there with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2768)|
| 0:46:10| Yes, I've been hearing all the while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2770)|
| 0:46:13| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2773)|
| 0:46:14| Mr. Lim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2774)|
| 0:46:15| We can hear you, Mr. Lim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2775)|
| 0:46:16| Can you give us your name and address, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2776)|
| 0:46:19| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2779)|
| 0:46:20| Philip Lim, 1708 Callaghan Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37912.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2780)|
| 0:46:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2786)|
| 0:46:27| Were you able to hear as I went through the record about the citations you received?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2787)|
| 0:46:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2792)|
| 0:46:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2793)|
| 0:46:34| And you heard the questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2794)|
| 0:46:35| I can also hear, yeah, Mr. Cowart mentioning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2795)|
| 0:46:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2800)|
| 0:46:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2802)|
| 0:46:43| So what we heard from Mr. Cowart was that...or from Sergeant Cowart was that the same person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2803)|
| 0:46:50| had, you know, committed the offenses which resulted in these citations for you in both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2810)|
| 0:46:59| instances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2819)|
| 0:47:01| Is that person still working with you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2821)|
| 0:47:04| Yes, she is still working for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2824)|
| 0:47:08| And the reason I did not fire her is because she's taking precautions of reading and she's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2828)|
| 0:47:17| not good at math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2837)|
| 0:47:18| So she did check the ID, but then she was struggling to figure out the age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2838)|
| 0:47:25| And also, she's the only bread earner in the family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2845)|
| 0:47:31| Most of them are all disabled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2851)|
| 0:47:34| And she's taking a lot of tests now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2854)|
| 0:47:38| And what we're doing is we're doing in-house things that if we have, like, pretending a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2858)|
| 0:47:49| minor and also someone just to come, you know, and buy beer or liquor, and if they check| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2869)|
| 0:48:00| the false ID, they'll get a bonus of $100, which we are doing right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2880)|
| 0:48:06| And we also install...we bought the ID scanner and we place it by the wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2886)|
| 0:48:14| And for now, everybody has to scan the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2894)|
| 0:48:20| And also, before they serve the beer or liquor, the manager will have to verify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2900)|
| 0:48:28| So that's what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2908)|
| 0:48:30| And also, all the servers and bartenders, they also downloaded the scanner into their apps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2910)|
| 0:48:41| They use the apps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2921)|
| 0:48:43| So we also do a weekly class for them to know, you know, to check every person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2923)|
| 0:48:54| Now, we had a situation about last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2934)|
| 0:49:00| There are a couple came in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2940)|
| 0:49:03| They're elderly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2943)|
| 0:49:05| I think they're about in the late 60s to 70s, early 70s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2945)|
| 0:49:12| So the same lady, that Lata, that had the problem with checking the ID and asking for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2952)|
| 0:49:28| that gentleman and the lady's ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2968)|
| 0:49:32| And they said, well, you know, we are aged enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2972)|
| 0:49:35| You can tell we are old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2975)|
| 0:49:37| But she was terrified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2977)|
| 0:49:39| And they did not give her the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2979)|
| 0:49:42| So they called the manager, which is Kenny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2982)|
| 0:49:46| So the manager came and said, well, I'm so sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2986)|
| 0:49:49| Even though, you know, you are old age, elderly, and we still need to check your ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2989)|
| 0:49:57| And they refused to give.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2997)|
| 0:49:59| So they walk out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=2999)|
| 0:50:01| And then one of the, I guess, the husband came back and said, well, you know, this is not the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3001)|
| 0:50:09| You can tell by my age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3009)|
| 0:50:11| And then so I replied to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3011)|
| 0:50:14| I said, well, you may have a suspended driver's license or something like that, you know, and we cannot serve you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3014)|
| 0:50:23| So they walked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3023)|
| 0:50:24| They were angry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3024)|
| 0:50:25| But we did our job, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3025)|
| 0:50:27| We didn't want to have another problem like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3027)|
| 0:50:29| Although they are elderly, you know, they may have a suspended driver's license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3029)|
| 0:50:33| So we don't want to take the chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3033)|
| 0:50:35| And his wife said, I'm going to put in Internet, you know, and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3035)|
| 0:50:42| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3042)|
| 0:50:44| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3044)|
| 0:50:45| Thank you for giving us those examples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3045)|
| 0:50:47| I'm going to open it up to the board members if they have any other questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3047)|
| 0:50:51| And I see one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3051)|
| 0:50:54| One more thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3054)|
| 0:50:55| We are in business for 11 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3055)|
| 0:50:58| And we have never got this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3058)|
| 0:51:00| This is the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3060)|
| 0:51:01| And the same lady.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3061)|
| 0:51:02| But she did check the ID anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3062)|
| 0:51:04| But, you know, it is what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3064)|
| 0:51:06| So we take all the precautions right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3066)|
| 0:51:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3071)|
| 0:51:12| Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3072)|
| 0:51:14| Thank you, Chair Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3074)|
| 0:51:16| And Mr. Lim, I thank you for sharing that detailed information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3076)|
| 0:51:20| And while I applaud the fact that, you know, you're employing this person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3080)|
| 0:51:26| You still have them on payroll because of their circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3086)|
| 0:51:29| But, sir, by you acknowledging that they struggle with math and continue to keep them in this position is not okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3089)|
| 0:51:37| Mathematics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3097)|
| 0:51:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3099)|
| 0:51:42| If you wanted to help this person, I think that it would have been more appropriate to maybe find another position where they were not in charge of checking IDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3102)|
| 0:51:50| Because at this juncture, to have two citations in such a short amount of time, it makes me ‑‑ it gives me pause to wonder how many other people who were truly underage and it was not caught.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3110)|
| 0:52:04| And that simple fact alone, and I do appreciate your honesty and acknowledging the fact that you were aware of this person's struggle with mathematics, I just feel at this point that there should be some additional action taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3124)|
| 0:52:18| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3138)|
| 0:52:21| We got the scanner ID installed, and we do classes, and she realized that we are really punishing her for not really study the, you know, the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3141)|
| 0:52:39| And right now, she uses it every day with the scanner, regardless of what age they are, she will ask for the ID and scan it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3159)|
| 0:52:50| And the manager will have to approve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3170)|
| 0:52:54| And, sir, I'm also going to add that even in your remediation, and you stated that you have it listed twice, that you all will ask for ID for anyone that appears to be over the age of 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3174)|
| 0:53:06| I know that you acknowledged today that you were carding everyone, but you actually have that listed that you all prior to, I mean, even after the first citation, that you were only asking, you were only requiring them to ask for ID for people who appear to be over the age of 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3186)|
| 0:53:23| And that, to me, is just is really not acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3203)|
| 0:53:27| And the onus does not fall on the employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3207)|
| 0:53:31| If you continue to keep them employed, it actually falls on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3211)|
| 0:53:35| Because, again, I appreciate your honesty, but you acknowledge that you knew that this person the first time that this incident happened with them, that they had an issue with mathematics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3215)|
| 0:53:49| And so, I feel like that responsibility falls on you at this point if you continue to keep them employed in that particular role, being responsible for asking for ID for anyone who looked to be over 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3229)|
| 0:54:03| And, again, I don't feel like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3243)|
| 0:54:06| No, I did not say to look over 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3246)|
| 0:54:13| I say every person, even the elderly people have to be checked ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3253)|
| 0:54:20| And that's what she's doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3260)|
| 0:54:22| So, anybody that comes in, we do an in-house stink just the other day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3262)|
| 0:54:30| And then so we give our bonus $100 for checking the false ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3270)|
| 0:54:35| So, we're taking a lot of precaution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3275)|
| 0:54:38| But thank you, Mr. Lim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3278)|
| 0:54:40| Let me interrupt you for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3280)|
| 0:54:42| Sergeant Coward had something to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3282)|
| 0:54:44| And then I think Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3284)|
| 0:54:46| Go ahead, Sergeant Coward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3286)|
| 0:54:48| Well, mathematics in this situation would not play a part because the cadet has to use their real ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3288)|
| 0:54:59| And it has her under 21 until birth date on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3299)|
| 0:55:05| So, there's really no reason for anyone to try to do the math to figure out her age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3305)|
| 0:55:15| Thank you, Sergeant Coward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3315)|
| 0:55:18| Do you want me to fire her if this is the case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3318)|
| 0:55:22| We're not going to comment on that, Mr. Lim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3322)|
| 0:55:29| What we want to do is make sure you're putting the safeguards necessary to not have another offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3329)|
| 0:55:35| Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3335)|
| 0:55:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3337)|
| 0:55:39| Sergeant Coward, do you know how many other times the cadet went in to do a sting or to have their ID checked?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3339)|
| 0:55:52| We've only been there twice in my tenure this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3352)|
| 0:55:57| Once on the 10th of January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3357)|
| 0:56:03| The other time was August 26th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3363)|
| 0:56:06| There was a different cadet each time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3366)|
| 0:56:11| However, I was with both cadets during both checks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3371)|
| 0:56:18| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3378)|
| 0:56:20| Mr. Lim, I have a couple of questions for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3380)|
| 0:56:23| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3383)|
| 0:56:25| After the first citation, what changes did you make?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3385)|
| 0:56:30| We did a lot of changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3390)|
| 0:56:33| We called the EGLE distributors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3393)|
| 0:56:36| We called the Cherokee distributors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3396)|
| 0:56:39| They gave us the ID, the H, where they show you the LEDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3399)|
| 0:56:49| We placed it at the bar area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3409)|
| 0:56:53| This server works in the Asian area, not the bar area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3413)|
| 0:56:59| We had a scanner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3419)|
| 0:57:02| Also, we got a lot of manual books from ABC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3422)|
| 0:57:10| Everybody had one in their pocket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3430)|
| 0:57:15| A small manual thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3435)|
| 0:57:19| Also, they downloaded it into the app.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3439)|
| 0:57:22| Is that what you did in January?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3442)|
| 0:57:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3445)|
| 0:57:31| I just want to remind you, we have three minutes until the council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3451)|
| 0:57:37| I'm just very concerned because this was in seven months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3457)|
| 0:57:41| I am in agreement with Vice Mayor McKenzie that she needs to be in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3461)|
| 0:57:45| different position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3465)|
| 0:57:47| She doesn't need to be fired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3467)|
| 0:57:49| That's on management or on you to figure out how to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3469)|
| 0:57:54| Sergeant Coward, on getting her trained?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3474)|
| 0:58:00| Oh, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3480)|
| 0:58:03| If Sergeant Coward would like to come and train even everybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3483)|
| 0:58:10| that would be a great thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3490)|
| 0:58:13| Well, I can't offer him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3493)|
| 0:58:15| But I think that would be a good idea is for each staff member to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3495)|
| 0:58:21| exactly what they're looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3501)|
| 0:58:23| If there was a birth date on there when they were of age,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3503)|
| 0:58:26| then it doesn't have to do with math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3506)|
| 0:58:28| She just needs to know what she's looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3508)|
| 0:58:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3510)|
| 0:58:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3512)|
| 0:58:34| So, beer board members, we have the option of referring to a suspension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3514)|
| 0:58:38| revocation hearing or taking no action,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3518)|
| 0:58:41| in which case if another violation occurs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3521)|
| 0:58:43| then they will go automatically to a suspension revocation hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3523)|
| 0:58:48| I'm going to wait just a few seconds and see if I see any other questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3528)|
| 0:58:52| or any motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3532)|
| 0:58:54| I don't see any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3534)|
| 0:58:57| So I'm going to say we're moving on on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3537)|
| 0:58:59| And so we'll take no action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3539)|
| 0:59:01| Mr. Johnson, I think that we are at the end of our meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3541)|
| 0:59:05| Chair, I don't want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3545)|
| 0:59:07| I don't feel comfortable with us not taking any action at this juncture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3547)|
| 0:59:11| based on what we've seen and what we've heard today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3551)|
| 0:59:15| I would like to make a motion that this case move forward for revocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3555)|
| 0:59:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3561)|
| 0:59:22| We've got a motion to send to a suspension revocation hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3562)|
| 0:59:25| Do I have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3565)|
| 0:59:27| I have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3567)|
| 0:59:29| Mr. Johnson, please call the roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3569)|
| 0:59:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3571)|
| 0:59:33| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3573)|
| 0:59:34| Council Member Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3574)|
| 0:59:36| I know we're on a time crunch, but in this, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3576)|
| 0:59:39| I guess I struggle a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3579)|
| 0:59:41| The previous case theoretically had three violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3581)|
| 0:59:44| I mean, on the rolling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3584)|
| 0:59:46| And so we move forward with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3586)|
| 0:59:49| And I feel like this gentleman has actually put in more precautions moving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3589)|
| 0:59:57| forward, you know, with the reader.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3597)|
| 1:00:04| And, you know, I struggle with previous before we're not moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3604)|
| 1:00:11| And they've actually had three violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3611)|
| 1:00:13| If you look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3613)|
| 1:00:15| Well, why don't we do this, Mr. Frost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3615)|
| 1:00:17| Can we just postpone this one until our next meeting in October?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3617)|
| 1:00:24| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3624)|
| 1:00:27| That's a priority motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3627)|
| 1:00:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3629)|
| 1:00:30| Let's make a let's since we're so more discussion on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3630)|
| 1:00:34| and I think it's important not to rush it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3634)|
| 1:00:36| You know, let's get a motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3636)|
| 1:00:38| One clarifying question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3638)|
| 1:00:40| What happens in the interim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3640)|
| 1:00:42| Well, if they get another citation, they'll automatically go to the revocation hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3642)|
| 1:00:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3648)|
| 1:00:50| And if no other citation takes place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3650)|
| 1:00:52| Then they'll appear before us on October 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200922?start=3652)|
