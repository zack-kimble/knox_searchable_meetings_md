| 0:08:03| Been appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=483)|
| 0:08:05| If we can do this without objections from this body, the sheriff would like to go ahead and take his oath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=485)|
| 0:08:11| It wouldn't take just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=491)|
| 0:08:13| And he's got some family members that want to get back out of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=493)|
| 0:08:15| And, of course, they have three or four hours' worth of paperwork to do so they can get finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=495)|
| 0:08:21| So if without objections, yeah, he'll bring them up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=501)|

| 0:08:41| And this will be the only one we do, so for the audience, the rest of it should go pretty quickly, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=521)|
| 0:08:47| We'll take a two- or three-minute recess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=527)|

| 0:18:23| Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1103)|
| 0:18:25| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1105)|
| 0:18:26| According to the charter of Knox County, congratulations, Mr. Tindall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1106)|
| 0:18:30| Is that in the charter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1110)|
| 0:18:32| Your seat is now vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1112)|
| 0:18:36| I don't, as a non-lawyer, of course, I don't agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1116)|
| 0:18:41| But I'm going to respect our law director's opinion and I will remove myself from at least this seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1121)|
| 0:18:47| I'll hang around, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1127)|
| 0:18:48| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1128)|
| 0:18:49| The Knox County Charter states this, if the commission member is elected, which you just were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1129)|
| 0:18:54| his or her seat on the commission shall immediately be vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1134)|
| 0:18:59| You've been elected to another office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1139)|
| 0:19:01| Congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1141)|
| 0:19:04| Commissioner Goodham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1144)|
| 0:19:07| To continue on with that thought, now we only have 18 members of this body that can vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1147)|
| 0:19:16| If we were to immediately go to fill Commissioner Tindall's seat, could that person deliberate with us right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1156)|
| 0:19:26| If the person is sworn in, they could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1166)|
| 0:19:31| If you're going to rely on the swearing in as being the official act, he's not been sworn into his new office yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1171)|
| 0:19:37| Why can't he continue on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1177)|
| 0:19:40| Because the charter says that his seat is immediately vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1180)|
| 0:19:43| So we've got another hole in our charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1183)|
| 0:19:45| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1185)|
| 0:19:46| Not at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1186)|
| 0:19:48| Not at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1188)|
| 0:19:49| The charter is very clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1189)|
| 0:19:51| And we can say that it's crystal clear on that point that Commissioner Tindall's seat is now vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1191)|
| 0:20:00| Let's swear him in and then go to the second district and try to appoint somebody and swear them in too at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1200)|
| 0:20:06| If you wish to swear Commissioner Tindall in now to take over the duties of the clerk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1206)|
| 0:20:10| Commissioner Tindall will be presiding as clerk for the remainder of this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1210)|
| 0:20:19| I'd say Mr. Padgett would be glad to yield that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1219)|
| 0:20:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1223)|
| 0:20:24| Does Mr. Tindall have a choice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1224)|
| 0:20:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1226)|
| 0:20:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1227)|
| 0:20:28| You have a choice, Billy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1228)|
| 0:20:30| I think just for clarifications and just to keep making sure we don't continue down the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1230)|
| 0:20:36| potentially lawsuits will be over this one appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1236)|
| 0:20:40| You know, I think the votes are not going to be that close probably one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1240)|
| 0:20:44| And we've got the register of deeds and the trustee and then the third race will be in the second district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1244)|
| 0:20:52| Mr. Chairman, do you know something I don't?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1252)|
| 0:20:54| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1254)|
| 0:20:56| Well, if it comes down to it, if they're close, it's going to be nine and nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1256)|
| 0:21:00| So somebody is going to have to change something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1260)|
| 0:21:04| I think according to the law, we don't need to have potential lawsuits over this one appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1264)|
| 0:21:09| Well, I think we can proceed with 18 persons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1269)|
| 0:21:11| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1271)|
| 0:21:12| That's what I think we should do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1272)|
| 0:21:16| Mr. Clerk, since we're on this subject, and I don't know, I was going to bring this up when we got to the commission seats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1276)|
| 0:21:26| Has a process been, I haven't heard of a process in which we're going to go about filling these commission seats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1286)|
| 0:21:31| But as I understand it in discussions with my lawyer, that once a commission seat has been filled by this appointment process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1291)|
| 0:21:41| the commissioner who is being replaced can no longer vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1301)|
| 0:21:46| Is that how we're doing it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1306)|
| 0:21:48| No, that's not the way that I see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1308)|
| 0:21:54| So let's just, for example, say the seat A of the fourth district is the first commission seat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1314)|
| 0:22:00| and John Doe is appointed to replace me, I can continue to vote on these other seats?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1320)|
| 0:22:08| The Tennessee Supreme Court, I believe, made it clear in Jordan versus Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1328)|
| 0:22:16| they said that the persons who are term limited, who have been ineligible to be in office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1336)|
| 0:22:22| and are, in effect, holdovers since September 1, may continue in office, continue to operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1342)|
| 0:22:31| Their acts are valid until their successors are named in accordance with the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1351)|
| 0:22:36| That also means qualified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1356)|
| 0:22:38| Qualified in this instance means sworn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1358)|
| 0:22:42| And so, you know, to further clarify that for you, Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1362)|
| 0:22:48| if a person is elected to a commission post and they wish to step out into the hall and be sworn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1368)|
| 0:22:56| they can come in and take their seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1376)|
| 0:22:59| Mr. Law Director, I direct your attention to Section 2.08 of our charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1379)|
| 0:23:04| where it says in the event of a vacancy in the office of a member of the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1384)|
| 0:23:09| the remaining members of the commission, let me stress the word remaining members of the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1389)|
| 0:23:14| shall fill said vacancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1394)|
| 0:23:16| There's no reference there to holdovers or it says the remaining members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1396)|
| 0:23:21| So if a person, if either a vacancy exists and we are filling it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1401)|
| 0:23:25| and the person whose seat is being vacated cannot vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1405)|
| 0:23:28| or we have this sort of odd Zen-like world where they're here for the purpose of a vacancy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1408)|
| 0:23:32| but they're not here for the purpose of vacancy, but they're here for the purpose of voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1412)|
| 0:23:37| We can't have that legally both ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1417)|
| 0:23:39| I would agree with Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1419)|
| 0:23:41| I think we are opening ourselves to many challenges, not just one, should, using the example of my seat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1421)|
| 0:23:48| I continue to vote for other spots in this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1428)|
| 0:23:52| I don't see anywhere in reference to the state law or charter law that allows, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1432)|
| 0:23:58| using me as an example, to continue voting on other seats after my position has been vacated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1438)|
| 0:24:04| And I would strongly suggest that we are just allowing those who may not make the appointment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1444)|
| 0:24:12| who have expressed interest in this race to challenge other votes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1452)|
| 0:24:17| simply on saying that Commissioner Schmidt was already replaced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1457)|
| 0:24:20| when the appointment for the Ninth District came up and his vote was an illegal vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1460)|
| 0:24:28| I just want to go on record with all due respect to the law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1468)|
| 0:24:33| who has done magnificent work over these last few weeks, that this is simply a disagree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1473)|
| 0:24:40| and I would challenge that opinion and further suggest to my fellow commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1480)|
| 0:24:45| we are opening ourselves to more legal situations here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1485)|
| 0:24:50| I understand your argument, Commissioner, and you still have to refer back to the Supreme Court's opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1490)|
| 0:24:57| We are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1497)|
| 0:24:58| The Supreme Court didn't say commissioners can stay on until all appointments are said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1498)|
| 0:25:02| until their successors are named.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1502)|
| 0:25:03| And when an appointment is named to my seat, that's what the Supreme Court asks to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1503)|
| 0:25:07| In accordance with the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1507)|
| 0:25:09| The law is our charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1509)|
| 0:25:11| The law doesn't say we can delay and continue to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1511)|
| 0:25:14| Commissioner Schmidt, we understand, but we've got to depend on the law director of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1514)|
| 0:25:20| His is an opinion only, but he's going to be the one representing this county in case there are challenges to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1520)|
| 0:25:26| Commissioner Greese.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1526)|
| 0:25:27| I challenge the ruling of the chair and ask for a roll call vote on this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1527)|
| 0:25:32| Second, if you need a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1532)|
| 0:25:35| Okay, starting the first issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1535)|
| 0:25:36| Mr. Chairman, I need you to recognize me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1536)|
| 0:25:38| I'm going to offer a substitute motion that this commission agree to agree with the position of the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1538)|
| 0:25:47| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1547)|
| 0:25:49| Okay, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1549)|
| 0:25:51| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1551)|
| 0:25:52| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1552)|
| 0:25:53| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1553)|
| 0:25:54| Two no's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1554)|
| 0:25:55| Commissioner Harmon, Commissioner Schmidt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1555)|
| 0:25:57| Mark Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=1557)|

| 0:34:30| due to the fact that he did not want to put me in a position of where I might have violated the Sunshine Act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=2070)|
| 0:34:35| according to the article in this morning's paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=2075)|
| 0:34:38| I told him I didn't feel I had, but I certainly respected his decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=2078)|
| 0:34:41| So I just want to say on behalf of Mr. Fisher, many of you who I called, and for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=2081)|
| 0:34:48| just simply called to let you know who he was, why I supported him, and not actually get a confirmation of your vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=2088)|
| 0:34:55| I just want that on public record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=2095)|
| 0:34:57| He has asked me to withdraw, which speaks volumes for his character, and I appreciate him even being considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=2097)|

| 0:35:42| Mr. Schmidt, is there any reason why I shouldn't do that, or is he asked to be totally withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=2142)|
| 0:35:48| Thank you, Mr. Greese.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=2148)|

| 0:41:46| I'm going to make a nomination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=2506)|
| 0:41:48| It's been speculated upon and people have asked me and I've declined to confirm one way or another publicly for a number of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=2508)|
| 0:42:02| When I entered politics about nine years ago, I was an unknown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=2522)|
| 0:42:08| I was not aligned with the school system or with a mayor's office or with a sheriff's department or neighborhood associations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=2528)|
| 0:42:19| I came out of nowhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=2539)|
| 0:42:24| And I kind of like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=2544)|
| 0:42:26| To not be aligned with somebody where you're free to vote your conscience I think is very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=2546)|
| 0:42:33| And you might say that my candidate is an unknown as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=2553)|
| 0:42:38| He may be unknown in political circles, but that's okay because he's widely known throughout the 4th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=2558)|

| 0:45:17| Question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=2717)|
| 0:45:19| Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=2719)|
| 0:45:20| If no one gets ten, what's the ruling from the law department or charter or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=2720)|
| 0:45:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=2727)|
| 0:45:28| Whoever out of the six, if no one receives a majority vote of ten,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=2728)|
| 0:45:31| the one who receives the least vote will drop off and will do a vote again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=2731)|
| 0:45:36| And unless someone receives a majority vote of ten,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=2736)|
| 0:45:39| then the next he'll drop off again down until we get down to where someone will receive ten votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=2739)|

| 1:02:57| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=3777)|
| 1:03:01| I would like to yield the floor to Commissioner Schmidt, and then I would like it back to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=3781)|
| 1:03:06| So as soon as Commissioner Schmidt gets back to his seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=3786)|
| 1:03:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=3797)|
| 1:03:22| Commissioner Schmidt, I've got the floor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=3802)|
| 1:03:24| but I'd like to yield to you if you'll come back to me after you're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=3804)|
| 1:03:28| Do you have anything to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=3808)|
| 1:03:29| I'm sorry, I do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=3809)|
| 1:03:30| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=3810)|
| 1:03:31| Mr. Chairman, I'd like to move that this item be moved to the end of the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=3811)|
| 1:03:34| and let's proceed with the next nomination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=3814)|
| 1:03:36| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=3816)|
| 1:03:38| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=3818)|
| 1:03:40| I would ask that we go ahead with the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=3820)|
| 1:03:44| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=3824)|
| 1:03:45| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=3825)|
| 1:03:46| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=3826)|
| 1:03:47| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=3827)|
| 1:03:48| Okay, we'll do a roll call vote, starting in the first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=3828)|
| 1:03:53| What are we voting for, Scott?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=3833)|
| 1:03:54| Voting on putting the commissioner of the fourth district, is it seat B, off until the end of our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=3834)|
| 1:04:01| That would be following.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=3841)|
| 1:04:03| Would you reopen the bid or just reopen the nomination or is it just between Lee Trammell and Scott Davis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=3843)|
| 1:04:07| Just leave it where it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=3847)|
| 1:04:08| And after Commissioner Jordan's replacement is named, we'd come back to seat 4A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=3848)|
| 1:04:14| Or B, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=3854)|
| 1:04:15| That's not at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=3855)|
| 1:04:16| Who's the last one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=3856)|
| 1:04:17| Well, it would be in the ninth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=3857)|
| 1:04:20| No, it wouldn't be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=3860)|
| 1:04:21| We start in the fourth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=3861)|
| 1:04:22| What does it do, circle around to the second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=3862)|
| 1:04:24| No, we go back to the first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=3864)|
| 1:04:25| We have to go back to the first to stay within our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=3865)|
| 1:04:31| We moved for item 4, commission seat 4A and B at the request of the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=3871)|
| 1:04:38| Mr. Chairman, I have a question about our procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=3878)|
| 1:04:41| Don't our commission rules call for us voting and dropping Lois' name until we have a winner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=3881)|
| 1:04:46| I don't see anywhere in there where it allows an interruption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=3886)|
| 1:04:50| I call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=3890)|
| 1:04:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=3893)|
| 1:04:54| Mr. Law Director, do you want to respond to the ----| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=3894)|
| 1:04:56| What you're doing, you're amending the agenda basically right now, so it's going to take a two-thirds vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=3896)|
| 1:05:01| I'd argue, Mr. Law Director, I'm not amending the agenda in any sense other than just suggesting if we're at an impasse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=3901)|
| 1:05:07| we move it to the back and let's handle these others and come back to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=3907)|
| 1:05:10| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=3910)|
| 1:05:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=3914)|
| 1:05:15| Mr. Law Director, is it a majority vote or two-thirds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=3915)|
| 1:05:19| I believe it's a two-thirds vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=3919)|
| 1:05:20| I believe what you're doing is amending the agenda and placing this item in another place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=3920)|
| 1:05:25| The agenda was set by notice of the chair and by publication in the new Sentinel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=3925)|
| 1:05:35| and so any variation from that would be an amendment and requires a two-thirds vote of this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=3935)|
| 1:05:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=3943)|
| 1:05:44| So are you ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=3944)|
| 1:05:45| I guess we'll do roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=3945)|
| 1:05:46| Mr. Clark, starting in the first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=3946)|
| 1:05:49| What are we voting for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=3949)|
| 1:05:51| I guess a yes vote would be to put this off until the end of our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=3951)|
| 1:05:57| Is that on the seat B?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=3957)|
| 1:05:59| A hasn't been handled, has it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=3959)|
| 1:06:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=3961)|
| 1:06:02| On seat 4B would come after the ninth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=3962)|
| 1:06:07| Okay, Clark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=3967)|
| 1:06:08| Is everyone prepared to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=3968)|

| 1:06:15| Mr. Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=3975)|
| 1:06:16| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=3976)|
| 1:06:17| Mr. Tenney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131part1?start=3977)|
