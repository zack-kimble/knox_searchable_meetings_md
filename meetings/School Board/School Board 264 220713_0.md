| 0:07:43| So I've enjoyed that for sure. Next, I'd like to highlight some of our TCAP results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=463)|
| 0:07:47| We talked about those recently earlier this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=467)|
| 0:07:51| First, very happy to report that we saw growth in both our English language arts and our math scores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=471)|
| 0:07:58| Elementary and high school students improve their English language art scores and are now performing at where they were pre pandemic levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=478)|
| 0:08:04| So, again, kudos to our teachers and our staff and our administrators who had just worked extremely hard under some very tough circumstances over the last couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=484)|
| 0:08:14| If it was extended hours through working, mentoring, kind of just fill in all the gaps that needed to be filled or even doing things like tutoring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=494)|
| 0:08:21| They really pulled together. So we're excited about it and really want to celebrate the success of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=501)|
| 0:08:27| And again, we're here for the kids. And I think that really mattered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=507)|
| 0:08:30| I also want to recognize that, you know, we think we learned a lot through the time of COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=510)|
| 0:08:35| And I think we have a great opportunity to to not stop at our pre pandemic levels, but to continue to push and learn for things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=515)|
| 0:08:41| I mean, examples of things like virtual and what it can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=521)|
| 0:08:45| We were kind of thrust into that, but we think we're starting to find kind of where that could be really good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=525)|
| 0:08:50| We're also continuing our district has continued to make increased commitment to our reading, our literacy and our science of reading and growing in those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=530)|
| 0:08:59| And I think you'll hear some of that in the Essar update today that we've we'll have our executive director of literacy and learning, a position that is created there to really call literacy out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=539)|
| 0:09:09| It's more than a third grade thing is something that continues through all all of our grades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=549)|
| 0:09:14| We also have a supervisor of reading training is something we haven't had in the past, really trying to design that and really make that stick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=554)|
| 0:09:20| So we'll continue to do things like that and move forward with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=560)|
| 0:09:25| Student scores will also be available to families later this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=565)|
| 0:09:28| We were on a call today with the commissioner to hear that the state has actually revamped that family family portal to give them some additional information and do some things like added video.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=568)|
| 0:09:37| So families can better understand what T-CAP scores mean and what that means for their student and how they're progressing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=577)|
| 0:09:44| I also want to welcome back our assistant principals who returned this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=584)|

| 0:09:58| Just, you know, can't really thank them enough for what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=598)|

| 0:10:37| Our security team is adding nearly 20 SSO's to the graduating class this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=637)|
| 0:10:42| I've had a chance to go speak to them once and Chief Perriard and his team have done a great job in preparing them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=642)|
| 0:10:48| This class will allow us to start with the most officers that we've ever had in place to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=648)|
| 0:10:54| I think, again, reflected in the $4.6 million investment this board made in security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=654)|
| 0:10:59| As we move into the start of school, we know having a secure environment is the most important thing for our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=659)|
| 0:11:04| So very grateful for the dedication of these new officers and for our SSO's and for our security staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=664)|
| 0:11:10| So, Madam Chair, that concludes my comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=670)|
| 0:11:13| Thank you so much, Superintendent Risley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=673)|
| 0:11:16| Next, we'll move forward with the ESSER 3.0 priority update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=676)|
| 0:11:43| Alright, good afternoon board members and everyone here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=703)|
| 0:11:46| Thank you guys so much for this time to share our ESSER 3.0 priority one financial academic skills update for July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=706)|
| 0:11:53| We always like to start with our vision, making sure that everyone understands that the overall role of ESSER funds is to use it for all students across all schools and all student groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=713)|
| 0:12:02| to make sure we're moving the needle in support of student payments to make sure that progress is at a great level and also post-graduation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=722)|
| 0:12:09| Also wanted to keep this in here as well, the reporting schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=729)|
| 0:12:12| We've made it through our first trimester, which started back in February, and so we've reported out all of our priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=732)|
| 0:12:18| Last month, we reported on post-graduation, and this month we're reporting on priority one financial academic skills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=738)|
| 0:12:24| And so also with this, as you can see, we've been hearing from myself and the party on it a lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=744)|
| 0:12:30| so this time we do have some people that have been in the field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=750)|
| 0:12:33| We have some principals and two teachers that have served the testimony to the board as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=753)|
| 0:12:38| We're really excited about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=758)|
| 0:12:40| Moving back to the why behind our priority and the design of it, all of our priorities are really designed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=760)|
| 0:13:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=787)|
| 0:13:26| Good morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=806)|
| 0:13:27| Good afternoon, Madam Vice Chair, members of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=807)|
| 0:13:31| So very excited to be here as we have been working on these foundation academic skills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=811)|
| 0:13:36| One of the things that we were able to do as we did our needs assessment was to look at how do we use this one-time funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=816)|
| 0:13:44| to amplify work that we know makes a difference for students when it comes to those foundational skills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=824)|
| 0:13:50| So as you can see up here, really looking at we have the right tools in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=830)|
| 0:13:56| but then how do we make sure that we're maximizing those tools, and we're seeing that pay off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=836)|
| 0:14:01| You heard about some of our scores in reading today, and we're seeing that increase in math as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=841)|
| 0:14:07| because we're being very intentional about thinking about the design of our curriculum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=847)|
| 0:14:11| and how we work on the intellectual prep to be planning that curriculum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=851)|
| 0:14:16| and really monitoring how that's impacting students and building a strong communication with families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=856)|
| 0:14:22| So you'll see when the first home literacy reports go out in October,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=862)|
| 0:14:28| we're launching a website to go along with that and some communication with families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=868)|
| 0:14:32| so they can make better sense of the information they're getting and be a better partner with their teacher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=872)|
| 0:14:36| because they'll have good information on how they can support their student at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=876)|
| 0:14:41| Really looking to increase the capacity at the school, and you'll hear some of that through what our teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=881)|
| 0:14:48| and principals are going to talk about where we're investing in not just having a really strong knowledge base| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=888)|
| 0:14:55| within the central office and within school leadership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=895)|
| 0:14:58| but that we're giving opportunities for our teachers to continue to grow and refine their knowledge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=898)|
| 0:15:03| through things like our literacy specialist program, because that's a lasting impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=903)|
| 0:15:07| It goes beyond the dollars that we have, and they are then able to continue to bring that knowledge to their faculties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=907)|
| 0:15:13| And then looking at some things we haven't been able to do before, like tutoring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=913)|
| 0:15:16| that is embedded in the school day so that our students who don't have access to tutoring outside of the school day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=916)|
| 0:15:21| are able to get that same leverage point that many other students do have access to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=921)|
| 0:15:27| so that we can see all students getting the opportunity to grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=927)|
| 0:15:31| So I'm very excited about what they're going to present, mainly because you're going to be hearing from teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=931)|
| 0:15:36| and principals who've been engaging directly with that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=936)|
| 0:15:39| So I'd like to turn it over now to our math supervisor, Gary Petko.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=939)|
| 0:15:47| Good afternoon, Madam Vice Chair, board members, Dr. Oswick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=947)|
| 0:15:51| Wow, it's a great time to be a math student, a math teacher in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=951)|
| 0:15:54| It's fun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=954)|
| 0:15:55| Primarily because of the intentionality that, as Ms. Jackson said, and what we're doing towards mathematics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=955)|
| 0:16:02| especially in middle school, is we're helping to prepare our students to become even more algebra ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=962)|
| 0:16:07| And we've had a really intense focus starting this past year in the middle school of math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=967)|
| 0:16:12| Some of the things we've worked on and are continuing and starting to work on is a new year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=972)|
| 0:16:19| this past year is a new instructional model, a new approach to instruction for mathematics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=979)|
| 0:16:23| more of a problem-based, where we can improve conceptual knowledge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=983)|
| 0:16:27| and the disposition towards mathematics, just bring back the joy and wonder of mathematics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=987)|
| 0:16:32| that I think has been lost not only in Knox County but across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=992)|
| 0:16:37| Continue to look at data from benchmarks that we're now trying to implement two to three times a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=997)|
| 0:16:42| Try to really work with our first-year teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1002)|
| 0:16:44| That's something that will really kick into place more this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1004)|
| 0:16:47| Work with department chairs, not only secondary like we have in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1007)|
| 0:16:50| but also elementary department chairs that came on board this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1010)|
| 0:16:54| We had a great day today with our pre-K through 12 math department chairs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1014)|
| 0:16:58| and a fun day of learning across the grade bands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1018)|
| 0:17:01| And then our demonstration classrooms that we started to implement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1021)|
| 0:17:04| and we'll have teachers start to visit this year in the middle school, an eligible one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1024)|
| 0:17:08| to give some type of model as to what we're really wanting to achieve in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1028)|
| 0:17:13| And these aren't perfect classroom teachers in terms of being demonstration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1033)|
| 0:17:17| but they're the ones that are really trying to set the stage for what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1037)|
| 0:17:21| And we've got a lot of great things going on in a lot of our middle schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1041)|
| 0:17:25| We sent some student work up here, but rather than me talk about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1045)|
| 0:17:29| I'd much rather you hear it from the people that are in the ground doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1049)|
| 0:17:33| What we've got is Ms. Desiree Jones from Vine, principal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1053)|
| 0:17:37| and Ann Stenner, our math specialist, who is targeted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1057)|
| 0:17:40| Thank you, Dr. Reiser, in terms of allowing us to have support into the different micro teams,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1060)|
| 0:17:45| which has morphed into the regions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1065)|
| 0:17:47| We've been able to implement our resources out to different areas of the town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1067)|
| 0:17:51| and Ann Stenner has been really instrumental in working with schools like Vine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1071)|
| 0:17:54| So I'd love to get them on board and talk about what they see and what's going on in their classrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1074)|
| 0:18:01| Good evening, and thank you so much for letting us take a moment of your time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1081)|
| 0:18:04| to talk about what we've been doing at Vine Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1084)|
| 0:18:08| Part of our initiative this year was to implement high-quality instructional materials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1088)|
| 0:18:13| and what this kind of demanded of our teachers is a shift in instruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1093)|
| 0:18:17| And it's very challenging for those of us who have been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1097)|
| 0:18:22| kind of experienced a traditional math model in our instruction as students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1102)|
| 0:18:27| So moving into new materials mid-year was a challenge, and Desiree jumped right on board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1107)|
| 0:18:34| herself as a math student, learned alongside her teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1114)|
| 0:18:38| and we saw incredible results with students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1118)|
| 0:18:41| Mr. Petko mentioned the disposition towards math,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1121)|
| 0:18:45| and we all know that math is not everyone's favorite subject,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1125)|
| 0:18:49| and that's true for middle school students as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1129)|
| 0:18:53| And we had some challenges this year getting kids to buy into learning math,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1133)|
| 0:18:58| particularly after a year of very heavy virtual learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1138)|
| 0:19:02| So this gave our students an opportunity to engage in math in new ways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1142)|
| 0:19:07| and I'm super excited about the student work that was produced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1147)|
| 0:19:11| as a result of just a very brief introduction to Unit 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1151)|
| 0:19:15| I was able to do some model lessons, to walk alongside the teachers through the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1155)|
| 0:19:21| and we saw great things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1161)|
| 0:19:23| And I'll let you talk specifically about those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1163)|
| 0:19:26| Yes. Dr. Reiswick, Ms. Satterfield, board, thank you for the opportunity to speak tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1166)|
| 0:19:33| I'm Desiree Jones, and I'm an English teacher, so I want to introduce myself that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1173)|
| 0:19:37| And I always thought I was not a math person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1177)|
| 0:19:40| I thought I hated math, and that was because, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1180)|
| 0:19:44| I'm that type of person who sees things in patterns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1184)|
| 0:19:48| and so I got great grades in geometry, but Algebra I, not so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1188)|
| 0:19:53| You know, obviously I have three degrees now, so I made it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1193)|
| 0:19:56| but it wasn't my favorite thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1196)|
| 0:19:59| And when Gary and Ann came out in August and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1199)|
| 0:20:02| hey, we have to switch our whole curriculum, I was very concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1202)|
| 0:20:06| because I know my math teachers are some of the best teachers in the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1206)|
| 0:20:11| All of my teachers are great, and I know that they're used to teaching in one kind of way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1211)|
| 0:20:17| But I also know that high-quality materials are essential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1217)|
| 0:20:20| especially if we're going to be teaching students who have been traditionally underserved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1220)|
| 0:20:25| And I was told this was a high-quality curriculum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1225)|
| 0:20:29| I did a little bit of research, and I jumped on board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1229)|
| 0:20:32| and I decided as an ELA person to put myself in the math PLC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1232)|
| 0:20:36| because I did not want to ask my teachers to do anything I wasn't willing to do myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1236)|
| 0:20:40| So I was in most of those PLC meetings every week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1240)|
| 0:20:45| I've told you all before how hard my teachers work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1245)|
| 0:20:48| And I listened to them complain at first, push back, say we can't do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1248)|
| 0:20:53| this is not going to work, it's going to take too much time, we don't have what we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1253)|
| 0:20:58| And I just approached it as a math learner myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1258)|
| 0:21:01| I was in classrooms, and I was like, oh my gosh, I love this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1261)|
| 0:21:04| I got this as a person who doesn't like math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1264)|
| 0:21:07| I was in classrooms, and I saw students excited about discovering things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1267)|
| 0:21:14| and being competitive about the right answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1274)|
| 0:21:17| And for a 7th grade girl to be excited about something other than what's on her phone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1277)|
| 0:21:22| that tells you that this is something that's grabbing their attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1282)|
| 0:21:25| And so my teachers went from, you know, I'm grateful for Ann Sennett and Gary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1285)|
| 0:21:31| because if I ask them to come out, they will teach a class if I ask them to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1291)|
| 0:21:35| So Ann was walking alongside my teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1295)|
| 0:21:38| I gave them some release time so they could plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1298)|
| 0:21:41| And she did the model lessons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1301)|
| 0:21:43| And they went from being resistant to sometime in early 2nd semester,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1303)|
| 0:21:48| they all took hold of it because their kids were taking hold of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1308)|
| 0:21:52| And my teachers are there for the kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1312)|
| 0:21:55| And when it came time for TCAPS and you kind of have a different schedule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1315)|
| 0:21:59| and, you know, you kind of go away from teaching for a week or two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1319)|
| 0:22:03| my teachers came to me and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1323)|
| 0:22:05| we have to go back to this way of teaching after TCAPS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1325)|
| 0:22:07| We have to finish this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1327)|
| 0:22:09| And for them to say that showed me that they really had that productive struggle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1329)|
| 0:22:15| which was a great model for our students to see our teachers struggling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1335)|
| 0:22:20| They were honest with, you know, I had to get used to teaching this way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1340)|
| 0:22:25| and this is not what I would normally do, but I'm working through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1345)|
| 0:22:29| That was a great model for our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1349)|
| 0:22:32| So I really think that this way of teaching, along with our school-wide focus in math,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1352)|
| 0:22:38| and everyone being on board to try what's best for our kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1358)|
| 0:22:42| helped us get, you know, the results, which are, you know, not public yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1362)|
| 0:22:47| but they are amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1367)|
| 0:22:48| They're well above what we predicted we could do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1368)|
| 0:22:51| And I think, you know, it's always because of our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1371)|
| 0:22:55| I always say I am blessed to be principal of Vaud Middle Magnet School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1375)|
| 0:22:58| because my kids are brilliant, smart, talented, funny, pre-teen people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1378)|
| 0:23:04| But my people in the building are amazing, especially my teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1384)|
| 0:23:08| I had everyone in the building teaching math second period during our extra time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1388)|
| 0:23:14| So anything that does this for our kids, that takes a seventh-grade girl out of her phone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1394)|
| 0:23:20| and gets her competitive with the young man next to her to get the right answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1400)|
| 0:23:25| is good for kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1405)|
| 0:23:27| And I know you all do what's good for kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1407)|
| 0:23:29| You need to support something that's good for our kids and good for our teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1409)|
| 0:23:33| I know it's hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1413)|
| 0:23:36| No one likes change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1416)|
| 0:23:37| But some change is a lot of change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1417)|
| 0:23:40| Most change is very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1420)|
| 0:23:41| So thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1421)|
| 0:23:46| Do you have questions for them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1426)|
| 0:23:47| Well, just real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1427)|
| 0:23:49| So can you just, like, in a nutshell, like, what is the, like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1429)|
| 0:23:52| I know this is probably hard to explain, but, like, just, like, a quick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1432)|
| 0:23:55| what is the biggest difference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1435)|
| 0:23:57| Like, what is, as a teacher, like, what are you doing differently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1437)|
| 0:24:01| I think, as a teacher, the biggest difference goes from being a presenter of mathematics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1441)|
| 0:24:07| to a listener of mathematics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1447)|
| 0:24:09| So rather than me explain to you how you should think about a problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1449)|
| 0:24:13| I have to elicit your thinking about the problem and discover where you are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1453)|
| 0:24:18| and take you where you need to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1458)|
| 0:24:20| So I have to honor your thought process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1460)|
| 0:24:23| and value what you bring to the table as a mathematician| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1463)|
| 0:24:26| rather than try to make you a clone of me as the mathematician.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1466)|
| 0:24:30| And that requires teachers to let go of some control in the classroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1470)|
| 0:24:33| because you can't always, you can anticipate what students are going to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1473)|
| 0:24:37| but you can't always plan for what they're going to say and do, which was terrifying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1477)|
| 0:24:43| The first time I taught a lesson, whether it was at Vine or any other school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1483)|
| 0:24:48| I thought, okay, here's what I hope the kids do, and here's what I hope the kids say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1488)|
| 0:24:52| and they did it, and they brought it together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1492)|
| 0:24:55| For example, the student work on the board, you can see some writing that the student did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1495)|
| 0:25:00| This was an eighth grade student where they had to compare the table and the graph.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1500)|
| 0:25:05| So it's two pieces of data that they had to compare, consolidate, and write about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1505)|
| 0:25:10| And this student just wrote about it, and what tickled the teacher to death| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1510)|
| 0:25:14| was that he went back and revised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1514)|
| 0:25:16| Oh, I meant to say unit rate because he wasn't specific enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1516)|
| 0:25:19| He wasn't coached to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1519)|
| 0:25:21| The student wanted to do that because he wanted his voice to be heard in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1521)|
| 0:25:26| So something I would understand, instead of giving them the Pythagorean theorem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1526)|
| 0:25:31| you might give them the shape and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1531)|
| 0:25:34| how would you figure out the number of degrees or whatever in this shape?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1534)|
| 0:25:38| And the students do it, but they don't do it in the traditional language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1538)|
| 0:25:42| So they come up with the concept, and then you steer them toward the academic language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1542)|
| 0:25:47| and that helps them to retain it more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1547)|
| 0:25:49| I know it helps me and the type of learner that I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1549)|
| 0:25:56| So basically after you're asking those questions and getting that feedback,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1556)|
| 0:26:00| then at that point you kind of get a little more into what a more traditional lesson might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1560)|
| 0:26:06| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1566)|
| 0:26:07| Okay, interesting. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1567)|
| 0:26:09| Board Member Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1569)|
| 0:26:11| Thank you, Ms. Centerfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1571)|
| 0:26:12| So first, Ms. Jones, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1572)|
| 0:26:14| I really appreciate your testimony of stepping into the curriculum and leading through learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1574)|
| 0:26:20| So that's a testament to your leadership, and I appreciate the way you approached that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1580)|
| 0:26:24| And actually my original question was exactly yours, like tell us a little bit more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1584)|
| 0:26:28| like what the magic is, the secret sauce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1588)|
| 0:26:31| And I just want to be clear on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1591)|
| 0:26:33| In teaching this way, which I appreciate, I know myself and like even my son,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1593)|
| 0:26:37| we get to answers in math like ten different ways, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1597)|
| 0:26:40| Like we're just, we do mental math and we're just kind of figuring out how to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1600)|
| 0:26:43| And I know many students who have been frustrated over the time, like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1603)|
| 0:26:47| but I've got to do it this way, this is the way they told me to get there, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1607)|
| 0:26:51| In teaching in this way, is it going to cause potential problems with students who are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1611)|
| 0:26:56| as they get into standardized testing and things like that on the math side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1616)|
| 0:27:00| or should it actually help them with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1620)|
| 0:27:02| Can you speak to that in terms of the connection between testing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1622)|
| 0:27:06| I cannot speak specifically about our scores,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1626)|
| 0:27:08| but we have done much, much better than we thought we would do this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1628)|
| 0:27:14| Much more better than we even predicted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1634)|
| 0:27:18| Awesome. Good. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1638)|
| 0:27:19| If I can add to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1639)|
| 0:27:20| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1640)|
| 0:27:21| I think one of the things that's, when you look at our standards across the grades,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1641)|
| 0:27:25| so you're talking about maybe in elementary school we're talking about multiple different ways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1645)|
| 0:27:29| but eventually we formalize that so that when I get to a procedure I know the most efficient way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1649)|
| 0:27:34| and that's just a mindset of thinking that is developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1654)|
| 0:27:37| So when I get to the standardized test, I'm more confident and willing to persevere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1657)|
| 0:27:42| If maybe I'm not exactly sure what to do, I have a bank of things to pull from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1662)|
| 0:27:46| So the specific test-taking strategies, of course, are their own thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1666)|
| 0:27:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1673)|
| 0:27:54| And I'll also say, like, that pedagogy of teaching, from my understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1674)|
| 0:27:59| and the research that it allows kids to take ownership of their learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1679)|
| 0:28:03| And when kids have ownership of their learning, they want to do it and they perform better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1683)|
| 0:28:08| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1688)|
| 0:28:09| Yes. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1689)|
| 0:28:12| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1692)|
| 0:28:14| When we were planning how to approach this session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1694)|
| 0:28:17| I actually watched Anne the day before in June do a session with our principals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1697)|
| 0:28:23| and had them go through a number talk and thought about doing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1703)|
| 0:28:28| and then decided having people do math on TV was maybe not the best approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1708)|
| 0:28:33| But actually, as you go through a curriculum like this, you become much more comfortable with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1713)|
| 0:28:38| So I'd like to transition to reading and literacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1718)|
| 0:28:44| One of the things that we are doing here is really putting some very focused attention on literacy, K through 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1724)|
| 0:28:51| So as Dr. Ryswick mentioned, we will have a new executive director of learning and literacy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1731)|
| 0:28:57| and he's created a position for supervisor of reading training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1737)|
| 0:29:00| because we have had a really robust training program in Knox County schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1740)|
| 0:29:06| and it's very hard to do all of the school support and maintain that level of training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1746)|
| 0:29:12| And we are very fortunate in our district that we have a really strong reading team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1752)|
| 0:29:18| that also has good relationships with the University of Tennessee that we want to maintain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1758)|
| 0:29:22| and also a public-facing presence with the Knoxville Dyslexia Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1762)|
| 0:29:28| as long as several other partners who are invested in reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1768)|
| 0:29:31| and we want to expand that focus so that we can work on both being ready to come to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1771)|
| 0:29:36| ready to learn to read, and also continue to provide the support that continues to deepen people's knowledge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1776)|
| 0:29:43| as we support children K through 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1783)|
| 0:29:46| So with that, I'm going to just turn it over to Janet Sexton,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1786)|
| 0:29:52| who will be able to talk about the work that we've been doing in reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1792)|
| 0:29:56| and she has a video for you as well as a teacher who can talk about some of the work that we've been engaged with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1796)|
| 0:30:07| Good afternoon, Madam Vice Chair, members of the board, Dr. Ryswick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1807)|
| 0:30:11| Thank you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1811)|
| 0:30:12| As Mr. Petko said, it's always such a privilege to stand before you and share the work that we've done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1812)|
| 0:30:19| and I know Dr. Ryswick has shared our success in both ELA and math as far as our TN Ready scores,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1819)|
| 0:30:26| but I will say as another shout-out to our teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1826)|
| 0:30:30| we were in year one implementing a high-quality instructional material or reading curriculum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1830)|
| 0:30:37| unlike anything we've ever had before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1837)|
| 0:30:40| And it's quite unusual to have this type of growth in the first year of any new curriculum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1840)|
| 0:30:50| so that speaks even further to what they were able to accomplish, and we're extremely proud of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1850)|
| 0:30:58| As we spotlight tonight specifically the Literacy Specialist Program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1858)|
| 0:31:01| I'd like to share just a couple of other things as you see listed here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1861)|
| 0:31:06| We have two cohorts that have now started in the Literacy Specialist Program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1866)|
| 0:31:12| which is in partnership, of course, with UT Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1872)|
| 0:31:16| We will have a third cohort beginning in June of next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1876)|
| 0:31:20| and then Cohort 4 will probably begin sometime that midsummer or in the fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1880)|
| 0:31:26| As a result of that, you know already, of course, that we will have one Literacy Specialist in each school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1886)|
| 0:31:32| and in some of our larger schools, 1,000 or beyond, we'll have someone representing K-2 and 3-5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1892)|
| 0:31:40| because their role will be supporting struggling students, doing survey-level assessments as needed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1900)|
| 0:31:47| and to consult with the RTI Squared team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1907)|
| 0:31:50| Secondly, the Reading 360 course 1 and 2, we have had probably, I'm sure it's well beyond 400| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1910)|
| 0:31:57| since we've created this slide, but the Reading 360 online course is part of the Tennessee Literacy Success Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1917)|
| 0:32:05| It's an excellent course. I've completed both elementary and secondary myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1925)|
| 0:32:10| and it's very similar to the year-long reading course that we've been doing for the last 8 or 10 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1930)|
| 0:32:16| but because of the pandemic, we were unable to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1936)|
| 0:32:19| The good news is that the Reading 360 course has been an excellent refresher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1939)|
| 0:32:24| for teachers who've already had the reading course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1944)|
| 0:32:27| and then for those probably 400 to 500, 600 teachers that we've missed the last couple of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1947)|
| 0:32:32| this gives them the foundation, the background knowledge that they need to move forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1952)|
| 0:32:36| so I feel like we have a bit of a leveled playing ground now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1956)|
| 0:32:39| The state has offered, in addition to, as an option, a Reading 360 course 2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1959)|
| 0:32:46| and it's five days of in-person training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1966)|
| 0:32:49| We've had seven weeks of that this summer, and I think we're going to be close to 420 teachers who have completed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1969)|
| 0:32:57| We've heard rave reviews. I've gotten lots of emails from teachers about this course and the Reading 360| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1977)|
| 0:33:04| and what a difference it's made for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1984)|
| 0:33:07| We are also working toward job-embedded micro-credential course that will be available probably after Labor Day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1987)|
| 0:33:14| because we know the first few weeks of school, teachers are quite busy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1994)|
| 0:33:18| Not everyone had the opportunity or is available in summer to attend five days in person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=1998)|
| 0:33:25| so we wanted to offer something optional that involves what a teacher is doing day-to-day or throughout the school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2005)|
| 0:33:34| It is self-paced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2014)|
| 0:33:37| It will involve looking at data, student work, uploading short video clips of their instruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2017)|
| 0:33:44| They'll receive mentoring and feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2024)|
| 0:33:47| We'll engage other teachers or colleagues to provide feedback or to use a rubric to score,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2027)|
| 0:33:54| but they, too, will have the opportunity to earn that stipend that is a part of the Reading 360.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2034)|
| 0:34:01| And we've been working with the math department for some time now on a KCS at home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2041)|
| 0:34:07| which will be a reading and mathematics portal, and we're going to hopefully have this ready sometime early October| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2047)|
| 0:34:15| once the first universal screening or benchmark has been administered to all of our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2055)|
| 0:34:21| This will be a place where parents or guardians or family members, anyone who's invested in children, can go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2061)|
| 0:34:27| We're going to have short video clips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2067)|
| 0:34:29| We're going to walk people through some of the reports that they might receive at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2069)|
| 0:34:34| We want to engage teachers to help us come up with questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2074)|
| 0:34:38| As a parent, one of the most common phone calls that I get is, here's what's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2078)|
| 0:34:44| What do I do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2084)|
| 0:34:45| And I always try to engage that parent in thinking about questions that they could go and ask the teacher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2085)|
| 0:34:52| so that they can get the information they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2092)|
| 0:34:55| And we're hoping this will be, as we see here, a very effective communication for our parents, caregivers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2095)|
| 0:35:01| and the goal is to really continue to build upon that school-home relationship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2101)|
| 0:35:07| And, of course, we'll engage teachers to help us think about ways that we can communicate this to our parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2107)|
| 0:35:14| because it's not going to do any good unless the parents know that it's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2114)|
| 0:35:18| So we're very excited about that, and we'll share more as it is released and ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2118)|
| 0:35:25| We had a teacher that, unfortunately, is out of the country today and couldn't be with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2125)|
| 0:35:31| but she very graciously agreed to record herself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2131)|
| 0:35:35| Ms. Anita Selman, Anitra Selman, excuse me, at Maynard Elementary is a member of the first cohort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2135)|
| 0:35:44| and she's going to talk to you a little bit about the impact of this program and experience on her as a teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2144)|
| 0:35:53| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2153)|
| 0:35:55| My name is Anitra Selman, a lead teacher at Maynard Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2155)|
| 0:36:00| For the past six months, I've had the opportunity to partake in the Literacy Specialist Program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2160)|
| 0:36:05| through a joint effort with Knox County Schools and the University of Tennessee, my alma mater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2165)|
| 0:36:12| The Literacy Specialist Program consists of five courses from January 2022 to May 2023 for the first cohort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2172)|
| 0:36:22| We've just completed our third course now, well over halfway through our program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2182)|
| 0:36:27| In our time, we have completed graduate-level courses, collaborated with colleagues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2187)|
| 0:36:33| researched evidence-based instruction and intervention practices, designed interventions for targeted skills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2193)|
| 0:36:42| and created lesson plans through the use of universal design of learning and instructional framework design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2202)|
| 0:36:52| Although we have two semesters left in our program, I'm in awe of the work that we have completed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2212)|
| 0:36:58| through our graduate-level program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2218)|
| 0:37:01| In addition, we have reinforced our knowledge about delivering intensive and explicit instruction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2221)|
| 0:37:07| through reading intervention, selecting and delivering reading diagnostics to target instructional needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2227)|
| 0:37:14| improving adolescent literacy in all content areas, best practices in adolescent literacy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2234)|
| 0:37:22| and being a more informed member of the IEP team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2242)|
| 0:37:26| In our first class, the first cohort has the opportunity to spend weeks with the primary student| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2246)|
| 0:37:32| on administering diagnostics, explicit intervention instruction, and progress monitoring our student| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2252)|
| 0:37:39| in their target area for follow-up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2259)|
| 0:37:42| This intervention consists of six assembly sessions for 30 minutes each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2262)|
| 0:37:48| All students' interventions include early literacy skills, including but not limited to phonemic awareness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2268)|
| 0:37:55| encoding, and decoding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2275)|
| 0:37:58| All students demonstrated progress in their targeted skill for the end of their instruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2278)|
| 0:38:04| Although this case study targeted one student, the knowledge we gained through the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2284)|
| 0:38:09| will hopefully reach hundreds of students in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2289)|
| 0:38:13| Personally, as a summer learning teacher, I've been able to apply my newfound knowledge of foundational literacy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2293)|
| 0:38:19| even in intermediate grades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2299)|
| 0:38:22| One of our students doubled the amount of books they've ever read independently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2302)|
| 0:38:27| After reading yet another book in the third week of summer school, the student told me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2307)|
| 0:38:32| You know what? I'm a pro at reading now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2312)|
| 0:38:36| I want all students to feel assessed and have access to the support they need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2316)|
| 0:38:40| and that begins with us as educators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2320)|
| 0:38:43| This program has made me a more knowledgeable, competent, and confident teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2323)|
| 0:38:50| I'm excited to share this learning with my school community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2330)|
| 0:38:54| I'm also excited to begin this new school year as a stronger educator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2334)|
| 0:39:00| Lastly, I'm excited that many more educators and students will reap the benefits of this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2340)|
| 0:39:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2348)|
| 0:39:14| And we're privileged to have here with us tonight in person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2354)|
| 0:39:18| Mrs. Brittany Ellis, who is a teacher at Halls Elementary. Brittany.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2358)|
| 0:39:24| Madam Vice Chair, members of the board, Dr. Roslick, thank you for the opportunity to speak with you this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2364)|
| 0:39:32| My name is Brittany Ellis, and I'm a fourth grade teacher at Halls Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2372)|
| 0:39:36| I'm beginning my 11th year at Halls, where I also serve as a lead teacher and the reading department chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2376)|
| 0:39:42| Eight of my 10 years at Halls, I have been departmentalized in ELA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2382)|
| 0:39:46| Thus, I've fully immersed myself in the teaching of reading and writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2386)|
| 0:39:50| It is an area that I love, and I feel very passionate about helping our students become the effective readers and writers I know they can be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2390)|
| 0:39:58| I was fortunate to be given the opportunity by my principal to participate in Knox County's first literacy specialist cohort through the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2398)|
| 0:40:07| I've been very excited about growing my knowledge in the important area of literacy and finding new ways to further meet the needs of my students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2407)|
| 0:40:16| My third course in this program has recently come to a close, and I've learned too many things to recount to you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2416)|
| 0:40:22| However, I would like to share with you a few areas I'm most excited about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2422)|
| 0:40:26| This program has challenged me in many ways, while also providing extensive knowledge using the most recent research on what students need in order to be successful readers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2426)|
| 0:40:36| Through this program, I have learned how to use the cognitive science behind how children learn to read in order to determine what assessments should be given to identify a student's strengths and weaknesses and target areas for instruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2436)|
| 0:40:52| By providing targeted, systematic, and explicit instruction, our students can make the gains they need to reach the ultimate goal of reading comprehension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2452)|
| 0:41:01| It is crucial that our students are taught using high-quality research-based instructional materials and strategies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2461)|
| 0:41:06| This previous school year, we implemented our new curriculum, Benchmark Advance, which is based on the science of reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2466)|
| 0:41:13| I am pleased to see so many strategies and activities within Benchmark Advance that coincide with what I'm learning in the literacy specialist program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2473)|
| 0:41:21| The first course I took in this program was emergent literacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2481)|
| 0:41:25| As a teacher who has always taught in the intermediate grades, I had a lot to learn in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2485)|
| 0:41:30| I was surprised how much this information benefited me as a teacher of fourth grade students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2490)|
| 0:41:35| As intermediate reading teachers, we know that our students need to be able to read the text independently in order to be successful in applying the comprehension strategies we are teaching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2495)|
| 0:41:48| Too often, when a student is struggling to read, we lack the tools to diagnose the specific area of need and also the strategies that will be most effective in helping them achieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2508)|
| 0:41:59| Understanding the foundations has allowed me to target foundational gaps of my students and support them in specific areas using research-proven strategies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2519)|
| 0:42:08| This is the power of this program, and I have already seen amazing growth in my students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2528)|
| 0:42:14| Additionally, this has allowed me to better support other teachers with their reading instruction through my roles as a lead teacher and department chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2534)|
| 0:42:21| As I reflect on the most impactful moment during my studies, I am reminded of a specific activity where we could truly experience the frustrations of a struggling reader.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2541)|
| 0:42:32| While trying to complete a nearly impossible task, I felt confused and defeated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2552)|
| 0:42:37| Realizing this is what many of our struggling students face while reading on a daily basis was a very eye-opening and gave me new perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2557)|
| 0:42:45| It has helped me to stop and think about how I can further address my struggling students' confusion and support them by capitalizing on every activity I do in my classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2565)|
| 0:42:54| On a larger scale, I feel confident that I am gaining knowledge and adding tools to my toolbox to help students in my school overcome these challenges, and that makes me excited about our future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2574)|
| 0:43:06| I look forward to continuing the work we are doing in this program over the next school year, as well as learning how to further support the teachers and students of Halls Elementary in the area of literacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2586)|
| 0:43:17| I would like to say thank you to my principal, Nathan Lynn, Janet Sexton in the Reading Department, and Knox County Schools for investing in your teachers so we can be the best for our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2597)|
| 0:43:28| Reading is the gateway to all learning, and it is one of the most important, life-changing skills we can give to our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2608)|
| 0:43:35| Thank you again, Madam Vice Chair, members of the Board, and Dr. Roswick for your time this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2615)|
| 0:43:45| Any questions? All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2625)|
| 0:43:48| Do you guys have any questions for them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2628)|
| 0:43:52| Okay. Well, I just personally want to thank them as well. Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2632)|
| 0:43:56| And this is for Ms. Sexton. So, just curious, I know that you mentioned that we've had 400-plus teachers go through the 360 Course 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2636)|
| 0:44:04| What's the goal that we're shooting for? And also, on the micro-credential, how many are we trying to get through that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2644)|
| 0:44:11| And is that something that they kind of self-select, or are we targeting teachers to ask them to go through that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2651)|
| 0:44:16| Okay. Good questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2656)|
| 0:44:17| As far as Reading 360 Early Literacy Course 1, that is a requirement of the Tennessee Literacy Success Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2657)|
| 0:44:25| So, all of us will have to complete that course by August 1, 2023.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2665)|
| 0:44:31| So, we've had about a year and a half to complete the course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2671)|
| 0:44:34| Hundreds of our teachers have already done so, and the response, as I said earlier, have been extremely positive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2674)|
| 0:44:42| partly because it mirrors what we've been teaching and the reading course that we've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2682)|
| 0:44:48| So, they felt very comfortable and very affirmed in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2688)|
| 0:44:52| And Course 2 is not required?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2692)|
| 0:44:53| Pardon me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2693)|
| 0:44:54| Course 2 is not required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2694)|
| 0:44:55| Course 2 is not required. It's an additional five days in person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2695)|
| 0:44:59| We were granted seven weeks from the state this summer, and we had 60 participants in each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2699)|
| 0:45:04| Next summer, we'll probably be granted eight to ten more weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2704)|
| 0:45:09| But again, as I said, summertime is busy for people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2709)|
| 0:45:13| We had over 300 people participating in the summer learning camp, which is extremely successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2713)|
| 0:45:18| Some people have small children or other jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2718)|
| 0:45:20| So, we wanted an alternative that would also be optional that would be job-embedded based on what a teacher does every day in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2720)|
| 0:45:32| We will begin by focusing on kindergarten, first, and second grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2732)|
| 0:45:36| We'll extend then to the intermediate grades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2736)|
| 0:45:39| And we've even thought about having a course as a follow-up for our literacy specialists when they finish,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2739)|
| 0:45:45| because of their role as a consultant that they'll be serving in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2745)|
| 0:45:50| A micro-credential course can be completed in three to four months, five to six months, seven or eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2750)|
| 0:45:57| It is self-paced, but there are check-ins, a lot of accountability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2757)|
| 0:46:04| building content knowledge alongside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2764)|
| 0:46:07| But we really want teachers to see that the work they do every day is extremely valuable and important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2767)|
| 0:46:16| And even though they'll be sharing student work or videos of themselves teaching, as I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2776)|
| 0:46:21| or looking at student data or collaborating with a professional learning community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2781)|
| 0:46:29| or even stepping out in a role of leadership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2789)|
| 0:46:32| there has to be ways for them to prove or show that what they're learning in this micro-credential course| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2792)|
| 0:46:39| is impacting student growth and achievement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2799)|
| 0:46:44| We're hoping, we have no idea, we're hoping that maybe this first year, 50, 60, 75 people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2804)|
| 0:46:51| we haven't actually set a goal, but we do have some teachers that we want to target first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2811)|
| 0:46:57| And we feel like as soon as we have a few teachers who complete the program and are successful and word gets out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2817)|
| 0:47:04| I feel confident that we're going to have a lot of teachers because we have teachers who want to grow, who want to learn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2824)|
| 0:47:10| And again, I think that's part of our success there, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2830)|
| 0:47:14| So thank you for that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2834)|
| 0:47:16| Board Member Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2836)|
| 0:47:17| Thank you, Madam Vice Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2837)|
| 0:47:20| I appreciate the extra time that teachers are taking to further their education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2840)|
| 0:47:26| As you already said, they're already doing 100 other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2846)|
| 0:47:29| And so that is huge, and I just appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2849)|
| 0:47:32| And I'm sure if parents recognize that, they would certainly appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2852)|
| 0:47:37| So I just appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2857)|
| 0:47:39| A question about, I know I heard early on from some teachers, and of course, as we've already said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2859)|
| 0:47:45| it's difficult when you have a new curriculum, I can't even imagine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2865)|
| 0:47:49| And so it's been challenging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2869)|
| 0:47:52| And I believe I was told that what you were asking them to do was to use the curriculum as it is presented to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2872)|
| 0:48:01| So now that they've gone through this year, do the teachers have more latitude to tweak it for their students?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2881)|
| 0:48:09| Can you talk a little bit about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2889)|
| 0:48:11| I'd be glad to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2891)|
| 0:48:13| There were five choices approved by the state, and we had 34 practitioners who made this decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2893)|
| 0:48:21| Whatever they had selected, there was going to be a shift in thinking, not in the settled science,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2901)|
| 0:48:28| not in the science of reading, not that we're reading, talking, and writing every day with complex text.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2908)|
| 0:48:33| But each of the curricula were created in a way that you start with a topic or concept,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2913)|
| 0:48:40| essential questions, and every lesson builds toward a task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2920)|
| 0:48:46| That's the direction, that's the research-based, high-quality instructional materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2926)|
| 0:48:53| Everything the students read, from a decodable, a foundational literacy text, to a read aloud,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2933)|
| 0:49:01| to a reader's theater, to a knowledge builder, or that grade-level complex text,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2941)|
| 0:49:07| all support that same concept, the same academic language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2947)|
| 0:49:13| And that is the platform or the structure of all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2953)|
| 0:49:17| It's amazing that you asked this because we sent a survey to teachers in the spring, very strong response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2957)|
| 0:49:26| We met in April with the department chairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2966)|
| 0:49:30| We now have 52, one for each elementary school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2970)|
| 0:49:35| They took all of the data from that survey and all of the comments, pulled out the big ideas and themes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2975)|
| 0:49:42| We then took that work and met with focus groups of teachers for every grade level in May and in June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2982)|
| 0:49:51| We just completed a full day today with the department chairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2991)|
| 0:49:56| And what we found through some of the comments and the responses is that there were lots of misunderstandings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=2996)|
| 0:50:02| a lot of misconceptions, which is rightly so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3002)|
| 0:50:05| You're implementing a new curriculum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3005)|
| 0:50:07| It's very comprehensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3007)|
| 0:50:09| I've been living in it, and I'm still learning and growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3009)|
| 0:50:14| Every teacher, and I think I should go back and look at the count, but I think we're about 325.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3014)|
| 0:50:20| So we can say that from April until now, we've met with over 300 teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3020)|
| 0:50:25| And I will say the shift in thinking is amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3025)|
| 0:50:30| The testimonies they had about how this worked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3030)|
| 0:50:34| I had first grade teachers saying to me that I've never had kids who could read and write this well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3034)|
| 0:50:40| I think it's evidence in the fact that our third, fourth, and fifth graders saw great gains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3040)|
| 0:50:47| Teachers who were hesitant in the beginning, very transparent conversations we've had the last several months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3047)|
| 0:50:53| And today was kind of the culminating or cherry on top, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3053)|
| 0:50:59| because our department chairs took all those misconceptions, all the teachers' insights and ideas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3059)|
| 0:51:04| and they now today created a definition of what it means to implement a curriculum with integrity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3064)|
| 0:51:11| which means as intended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3071)|
| 0:51:13| And they put together the presentation for every grade level for our August DLD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3073)|
| 0:51:20| Because every teacher that we met with, even people who said, look, I hated it in the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3080)|
| 0:51:25| I didn't want to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3085)|
| 0:51:28| They recognize now because they see the purpose and the intentionality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3088)|
| 0:51:34| Everything builds toward the next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3094)|
| 0:51:38| So I think we're going to go into this next school year with teachers really ready to roll and go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3098)|
| 0:51:45| But you have to live through something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3105)|
| 0:51:47| You have to teach it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3107)|
| 0:51:49| You have to be a practitioner to really get that perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3109)|
| 0:51:52| So thank you for taking the time to ask me that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3112)|
| 0:51:55| And back to the Reading 360.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3115)|
| 0:51:57| They also get 30 hours of in-service and 30 PVPs toward their next licensure, which is an excellent gift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3117)|
| 0:52:06| And then for Course 2, they get $1,000 from the state for completion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3126)|
| 0:52:11| So even though it's an investment of time, they're also being treated as professionals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3131)|
| 0:52:16| and receiving things that they deserve in return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3136)|
| 0:52:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3139)|
| 0:52:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3140)|
| 0:52:26| All right. Thank you guys so much for taking the time to present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3146)|
| 0:52:29| And board members and vice chair and Dr. Riser, thank you guys so much for this time as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3149)|
| 0:52:34| Personally, just given a personal note, I really love the testimonies because it breathes life into the work we've been talking about for months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3154)|
| 0:52:41| Right. We've been talking about the numbers, the strategies, the percentages, where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3161)|
| 0:52:45| But now we're talking about the work and we're seeing that it's moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3165)|
| 0:52:48| And also it's creating lead learners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3168)|
| 0:52:51| We hear principals like Principal Desiree talking about her getting in and doing the work as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3171)|
| 0:52:55| And it's also inspiring other teachers to be teacher leaders as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3175)|
| 0:52:58| So what better way to use the extra dollars than for that, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3178)|
| 0:53:01| So we're going to move forward with the progress of the action steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3181)|
| 0:53:04| Just two quick slides here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3184)|
| 0:53:08| This is for pre-K. I mean, I'm sorry, K through 2 foundational literacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3188)|
| 0:53:12| And we have 32 percent that are complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3192)|
| 0:53:14| We have 50 percent that are on track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3194)|
| 0:53:16| And we have 17 percent that are not started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3196)|
| 0:53:19| And those are based on timelines as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3199)|
| 0:53:20| They'll be started here in the next coming couple months here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3200)|
| 0:53:24| And also briefly looking at math, 6 through 8 math, we have 14 percent complete, 42 percent on track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3204)|
| 0:53:30| We have 10 percent with minor delays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3210)|
| 0:53:32| And we have 34 percent not started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3212)|
| 0:53:34| And those are based on timelines as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3214)|
| 0:53:36| And so this is what I call our overall report card, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3216)|
| 0:53:40| So out of our strategies that are on track, we have five out of six that are on track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3220)|
| 0:53:44| Our action steps that are completed, we have 32 overall out of the 127 action steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3224)|
| 0:53:50| They're completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3230)|
| 0:53:51| Action steps on track, 60 out of 127, 47 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3231)|
| 0:53:55| Action steps with minor delays, five out of 127, 4 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3235)|
| 0:53:59| So we're looking good there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3239)|
| 0:54:00| And action steps not started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3240)|
| 0:54:02| And that's based on the timeline again, which are 31 out of 127.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3242)|
| 0:54:06| So some of the barriers that we, you know, are continuing that we actually are working through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3246)|
| 0:54:10| and we've made some progress on are the procurement issues and concerns there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3250)|
| 0:54:14| But we've made some really huge strides with that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3254)|
| 0:54:17| And ongoing staffing challenges that we're supporting our principals with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3257)|
| 0:54:20| making sure we have people in front of our students when schools open here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3260)|
| 0:54:24| So we're looking forward to that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3264)|
| 0:54:26| And this concludes our presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3266)|
| 0:54:30| This concludes my presentation to you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3270)|
| 0:54:32| So thank you guys for being patient with me since January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3272)|
| 0:54:35| I've enjoyed this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3275)|
| 0:54:36| I've learned a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3276)|
| 0:54:38| It has grown me and it has stretched me as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3278)|
| 0:54:40| But it also has forced me to really think about being more intentional with the work we're doing for our students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3280)|
| 0:54:47| and also making sure we're growing leaders across our district, which I'm extremely proud of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3287)|
| 0:54:51| With that being said, I would like to present and not present because you guys know her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3291)|
| 0:54:56| Ms. Renee Kelly, she's going to take the lead on this work as our senior advisor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3296)|
| 0:55:01| And I'm going to be taking over the lead of the region five director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3301)|
| 0:55:06| So I'm looking forward to that work as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3306)|
| 0:55:08| Renee, you got anything you want to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3308)|
| 0:55:11| Yeah, for the two people in the room that don't know me, I'm Renee Kelly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3311)|
| 0:55:16| Excited to be taking over this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3316)|
| 0:55:19| And I would like to clarify, senior has nothing to do with my age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3319)|
| 0:55:22| It has to do with my experience as an educator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3322)|
| 0:55:25| Thank you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3325)|
| 0:55:26| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3326)|
| 0:55:27| And just as a caveat, I did not create that name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3327)|
| 0:55:30| So I'm not getting in trouble with that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3330)|
| 0:55:33| But thank you guys so much for your patience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3333)|
| 0:55:35| One second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3335)|
| 0:55:36| Board Member Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3336)|
| 0:55:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3337)|
| 0:55:38| Thank you, Madam Vice Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3338)|
| 0:55:39| Dr. Murphy, just one quick question because we're getting close to the start of school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3339)|
| 0:55:42| Can you remind us how many tutors we are trying to hire and how that's going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3342)|
| 0:55:46| Because I know it's a big number, but I just want to get a sense of the trajectory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3346)|
| 0:55:50| And I know I didn't prep you with that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3350)|
| 0:55:52| Yeah, Ms. Jackson has that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3352)|
| 0:55:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3354)|
| 0:55:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3356)|
| 0:55:57| So if we were to hire full-time equivalents, we're looking to hire around 220 full-time teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3357)|
| 0:56:05| Of course, that's more because we have most people wanting to do part-time or time card work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3365)|
| 0:56:10| I will tell you that in the last announcement to go out asking for tutors, in five days after that announcement, we had 265 applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3370)|
| 0:56:20| So people are motivated to come in and help and get this work underway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3380)|
| 0:56:27| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3387)|
| 0:56:28| That's awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3388)|
| 0:56:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3389)|
| 0:56:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3390)|
| 0:56:31| Thank you all so much for the update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3391)|
| 0:56:33| And Renee Kelly, I'm excited to see how you continue to expand this work in the presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3393)|
| 0:56:38| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3398)|
| 0:56:39| Moving forward on the agenda, going to superintendent evaluation discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3399)|
| 0:56:44| So board members, this is the first time you are seeing this, and I'm fully aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3404)|
| 0:56:49| So the goal, right, is I want to just talk to you all a little bit about how we got to this evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3409)|
| 0:56:57| So board member Henderson, if you want to help me recall anything that I missed that you can add to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3417)|
| 0:57:03| I would love for you all to take this, go home, look over it, digest it, dream about it, all the things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3423)|
| 0:57:12| And then when we come back in August, have a discussion about what we want to change, what we want to add, and then that Wednesday meeting, we will vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3432)|
| 0:57:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3440)|
| 0:57:21| So we'll have a whole month or a couple weeks to think about how we can enhance it, what we like, what we want to keep, what we want to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3441)|
| 0:57:29| And so how we got to this particular evaluation instrument, we, as you know, the board voted to have TSBA do an evaluation tool for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3449)|
| 0:57:39| So for us, so we had board members submit some suggestions that they wanted to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3459)|
| 0:57:44| We also gave them TSBA, our previous evaluation form, and then they took their insight and created this instrument that we have here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3464)|
| 0:57:55| And at the committee meeting that we had, the superintendent search committee meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3475)|
| 0:58:00| we went through all of the evaluation tool that was provided from TSBA and took out maybe some of the redundant questions that were on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3480)|
| 0:58:10| And then we kind of read through every evaluation marker here to say, okay, what does this actually mean if somebody that is not in education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3490)|
| 0:58:21| just a community member or a parent that wants to do the survey, will they have insight to put there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3501)|
| 0:58:26| We added comment sections for each of the opportunities that are listed on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3506)|
| 0:58:32| But yes, so go through it, and we can have discussion now as well if you have more additional questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3512)|
| 0:58:37| Betsy, did I miss anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3517)|
| 0:58:39| It was a while back, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3519)|
| 0:58:41| No, I think you covered everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3521)|
| 0:58:43| You know, our committee met about a month ago, and so we were very intentional and thoughtful about this evaluation tool to cater it towards Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3523)|
| 0:58:54| to cater it towards our community and what's going on in our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3534)|
| 0:58:59| So if you guys want to go through it, like Ebony said, but she pretty much covered everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3539)|
| 0:59:04| But I do like that we added a comment section on every section of this, so that way it's a pretty thorough evaluation tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3544)|
| 0:59:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3554)|
| 0:59:15| Personally, I do still feel like it's a little too lengthy, but that's feedback that you all can provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3555)|
| 0:59:20| Board Member Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3560)|
| 0:59:23| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3563)|
| 0:59:26| When you went through this as a committee to take out redundant questions, who was available to work with you on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3566)|
| 0:59:35| So I wouldn't say it was – well, and it wasn't much that we took out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3575)|
| 0:59:39| So it was the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3579)|
| 0:59:40| It was Betsy, Board Member Betsy Henderson, myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3580)|
| 0:59:43| We had community representatives in there, so Paula Hancock was with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3583)|
| 0:59:49| Gary was in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3589)|
| 0:59:50| Terry was in there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3590)|
| 0:59:51| So we didn't have anybody from research and evaluation or HR?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3591)|
| 0:59:55| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3595)|
| 0:59:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3596)|
| 0:59:57| That concerns me, that research and evaluation hasn't been involved in that and that HR has not been involved in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3597)|
| 1:00:03| What also concerns me is that it was my understanding that what we had voted on for the committee to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3603)|
| 1:00:10| was to work with TSBA to present to us their evaluation tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3610)|
| 1:00:17| So it seems like what we have in front of us is beyond the scope of what the board approved for the committee to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3617)|
| 1:00:24| So that's concerning to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3624)|
| 1:00:28| And since this is the first time seeing it, of course, I don't know what's completely in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3628)|
| 1:00:34| It's quite long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3634)|
| 1:00:35| It looks so similar to what we have now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3635)|
| 1:00:39| Has anybody looked at like a crosswalk between the old one and this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3639)|
| 1:00:44| Yes, so I do want to bring to, if you can, to recall maybe two months ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3644)|
| 1:00:50| Terry did send out the TSBA evaluation to all board members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3650)|
| 1:00:55| and that's when we got feedback from board members to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3655)|
| 1:00:57| this is what I'd like to see, this is what I want to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3657)|
| 1:01:00| And that's when we had the committee meet in to take that feedback and go through the evaluation tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3660)|
| 1:01:04| So we did do a crosswalk during that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3664)|
| 1:01:07| So my concern would be that that was, I feel like that's beyond the scope of what the committee was to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3667)|
| 1:01:14| because that's not what this board voted for the committee to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3674)|
| 1:01:21| I don't know, that's just concerning to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3681)|
| 1:01:23| My other concern is why we would vote on this a month before the board changes by at least a third.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3683)|
| 1:01:34| I think that's setting up some difficulties for our superintendent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3694)|
| 1:01:40| when you have one group of people setting up an evaluation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3700)|
| 1:01:44| and then another group who has not been part of that at all coming in and expected to follow that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3704)|
| 1:01:51| And I realize that when we get new board members that happens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3711)|
| 1:01:55| but I think it's concerning to try to do it so quickly and so immediately before that change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3715)|
| 1:02:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3730)|
| 1:02:11| Board Member Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3731)|
| 1:02:14| Thank you, Madam Vice Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3734)|
| 1:02:17| I feel like what you all have done is within the scope of what we asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3737)|
| 1:02:21| My understanding was that the committee was going to work with TSVA to develop an evaluation tool,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3741)|
| 1:02:26| and I feel like that's what's happening here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3746)|
| 1:02:29| I'm not really concerned about the timing in the sense of, I think we originally talked about that probably in January,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3749)|
| 1:02:35| so I think we've known that this work is happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3755)|
| 1:02:38| My question is, I think we've seen how good our board is at editing in a meeting together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3758)|
| 1:02:43| which is never fun and we should never do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3763)|
| 1:02:47| So is the most appropriate thing to do from here to pass any suggested changes to the committee through Terry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3767)|
| 1:02:54| and send that your all's way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3774)|
| 1:02:56| And then if so, I do agree with Ms. Owen that I would like to before that work session for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3776)|
| 1:03:02| once you all take into consideration our suggested changes for HR and for research and evaluation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3782)|
| 1:03:10| to take a look at it and see if they have any recommendations on how that might be smoothed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3790)|
| 1:03:15| Yeah, perfect, for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3795)|
| 1:03:17| So the preference for all transparency purposes will be to send information to Terry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3797)|
| 1:03:23| and then Terry, if you can send that same information to all board members so people can see what's being communicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3803)|
| 1:03:28| And I will say that HR has looked at this actual evaluation tool and provided feedback,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3808)|
| 1:03:33| but I would like to wait until we get everything to get additional feedback from everybody before sharing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3813)|
| 1:03:39| So they weren't in the meeting with us, but they did look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3819)|
| 1:03:44| If you want to speak, Board Member Henderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3824)|
| 1:03:46| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3826)|
| 1:03:47| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3827)|
| 1:03:48| And just to speak to getting this evaluation instrument tool, board members, feel free to weigh in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3828)|
| 1:03:55| but I believe it's our responsibility as the board that hired the superintendent to also complete the evaluation instrument| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3835)|
| 1:04:02| because you are asking three-fourths of the board to come in on something that they have no idea what we've been working on for a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3842)|
| 1:04:09| So that's just my preference and my perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3849)|
| 1:04:13| Board Member Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3853)|
| 1:04:14| Thank you, Madam Vice Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3854)|
| 1:04:16| I would agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3856)|
| 1:04:17| I think that it would be difficult for new board members to come on and have that waiting for them to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3857)|
| 1:04:23| I think that – and it's also incumbent upon us to get to our superintendent what we're evaluating him on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3863)|
| 1:04:29| And so I think that also time is of the essence in that respect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3869)|
| 1:04:34| And I would be interested in – we always have the struggle with the timing of providing the review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3874)|
| 1:04:43| and the evaluation specifically with regard to the research and development to fill in all of that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3883)|
| 1:04:50| So if we could have that information also, what the current timing thought is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3890)|
| 1:04:55| because we've talked about this so much that I can't even remember without going back to look what we last decided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3895)|
| 1:05:01| So what the timing expectation is and also what's available when based on REI, REA, REA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3901)|
| 1:05:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3909)|
| 1:05:10| We talked a little bit about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3910)|
| 1:05:11| Do you all remember?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3911)|
| 1:05:13| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3913)|
| 1:05:15| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3915)|
| 1:05:16| So this evaluation is totally in the hands of the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3916)|
| 1:05:21| and you all collectively need to figure out what your next action steps are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3921)|
| 1:05:26| because at this point the committee has presented a tool,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3926)|
| 1:05:32| which to my understanding is a combination of TSBA and the old tool that the board had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3932)|
| 1:05:42| So somehow this board needs to decide, okay, what's the next date, what's the next event to modify this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3942)|
| 1:05:52| And I hear what you're saying, Madam Vice Chair, is to send it to Ms. Coatney, which I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3952)|
| 1:05:58| That's perfectly fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3958)|
| 1:06:00| But then at some point that information needs to be synthesized by the board and then discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3960)|
| 1:06:06| and at some point in the future decide upon what evaluation tool you all want to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3966)|
| 1:06:13| And obviously that would include Dr. Ryswick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3973)|
| 1:06:16| I mean, that would include, I agree, HR and research and development and those pieces as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3976)|
| 1:06:24| But I would encourage this board to maybe tonight come up with what your next step is and vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3984)|
| 1:06:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3992)|
| 1:06:34| Oh, and the timing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3994)|
| 1:06:36| Scott Bolton back there gave a discussion about that at one time, and it's been some time ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=3996)|
| 1:06:43| He could probably tell us exactly when it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4003)|
| 1:06:45| But as I recall, he was saying, which is true, that the data from the state is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4005)|
| 1:06:55| only available year to year later on, you know, after the school year starts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4015)|
| 1:07:00| I mean, it's not available in the summer, but it would be available sometime in the fall, October, November, as I recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4020)|
| 1:07:08| So a lot of times the timing of an evaluation of a superintendent and, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4028)|
| 1:07:14| probably not this year for Dr. Ryswick because he's just fresh on the job, but from year to year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4034)|
| 1:07:20| you're probably looking sometime in the winter, perhaps December, January as a time to evaluate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4040)|
| 1:07:25| which would be well away from the election cycle because, as we know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4045)|
| 1:07:30| there's laws around, you know, evaluating during an election timing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4050)|
| 1:07:35| but, you know, still have the information that you all want and need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4055)|
| 1:07:41| Board Member Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4061)|
| 1:07:43| Thank you, Madam Vice Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4063)|
| 1:07:46| Ms. Coatney, if you could send out this in words so that for those of us who love computers and not paper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4066)|
| 1:07:53| we can use track changes to maybe make some suggestions, that would be fantastic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4073)|
| 1:07:58| And then also, I just looked briefly and I didn't see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4078)|
| 1:08:02| Did you all have some discussion about who and how the 360 version would be disseminated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4082)|
| 1:08:12| Like who it would be sent to and how it would be disseminated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4092)|
| 1:08:15| We did not fully have too much discussion, but I imagine it could be something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4095)|
| 1:08:20| the same setup that we had when we took surveys from the search and putting that in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4100)|
| 1:08:28| Question one is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4108)|
| 1:08:31| Yeah, I saw the parenthetical statement, but it was kind of, it didn't look like a definitive list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4111)|
| 1:08:35| It kind of looked like any of these groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4115)|
| 1:08:37| So that might be something to get REA's feedback on is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4117)|
| 1:08:42| how that might be implemented and who may be the best sources of that would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4122)|
| 1:08:46| And Mr. Dupler, just to be clear on your comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4126)|
| 1:08:50| I think you're suggesting that somebody makes a motion tonight with a timetable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4130)|
| 1:08:54| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4134)|
| 1:08:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4135)|
| 1:08:56| And I do want to also throw out there that what's in front of you is a combination,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4136)|
| 1:09:02| is what basically TSBA provided to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4142)|
| 1:09:05| And so this is what we paid for and we cross-walked it with what we had used previously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4145)|
| 1:09:10| because we understood how much work was used on that evaluation tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4150)|
| 1:09:13| So those are both combinations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4153)|
| 1:09:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4158)|
| 1:09:21| So go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4161)|
| 1:09:22| Board Member Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4162)|
| 1:09:23| So I make a motion for the committee to gather the information from board members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4163)|
| 1:09:28| consolidate it, and bring back an evaluation tool for this board to vote on at our August meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4168)|
| 1:09:35| Yeah, August is next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4175)|
| 1:09:38| If that timetable is possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4178)|
| 1:09:47| I need a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4187)|
| 1:09:53| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4193)|
| 1:09:54| Board Member Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4194)|
| 1:09:56| Thank you, Madam Vice Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4196)|
| 1:09:57| I'd like to make a friendly amendment to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4197)|
| 1:09:59| And I think, I agree with the, and I think this was the intention when the board really originally voted on doing this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4199)|
| 1:10:07| in conjunction with hiring Dr. Ryswick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4207)|
| 1:10:10| is I do agree that we should try to approve this before the incoming board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4210)|
| 1:10:16| and finish that task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4216)|
| 1:10:17| To me it's a part of the hiring process is that you would develop that evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4217)|
| 1:10:20| Well, what that puts us in is the August timeline, whether or not we like it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4220)|
| 1:10:24| So my recommendation to add to that motion is that whatever gets brought to the work session in August| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4224)|
| 1:10:31| has been reviewed and vetted by HR, REA, and Dr. Ryswick that the committee would have met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4231)|
| 1:10:38| I'm not saying you wouldn't have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4238)|
| 1:10:39| I just think it's important to specify that whatever we get, Dr. Ryswick, REA, and HR would have already seen it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4239)|
| 1:10:47| and basically given their light thumbs up to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4247)|
| 1:10:51| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4251)|
| 1:10:52| That wasn't worded beautifully in terms of a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4252)|
| 1:10:57| I think you get the intent, though, of what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4257)|
| 1:10:59| I'm fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4259)|
| 1:11:01| Board Member Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4261)|
| 1:11:03| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4263)|
| 1:11:04| Mr. Dupler, is there a deliberative issue with the committee gathering that input from us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4264)|
| 1:11:17| So, I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4277)|
| 1:11:19| I mean, the committee is public noticed, so whatever they do would be an open meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4279)|
| 1:11:28| and then the committee has to bring that back to the board for the board to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4288)|
| 1:11:36| So, the answer is, I mean, they have to discuss and they would have to vote amongst themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4296)|
| 1:11:43| to bring a recommendation back to the board, but the board itself has to approve the tool at some point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4303)|
| 1:11:49| and can send it back or vote it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4309)|
| 1:11:53| So, I mean, it's completely up to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4313)|
| 1:11:58| Board Member Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4318)|
| 1:12:00| Thank you, Madam Vice Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4320)|
| 1:12:01| Just a clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4321)|
| 1:12:03| Mr. Dupler, I think it's important whenever we bring up deliberative issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4323)|
| 1:12:07| and whether or not we're crossing lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4327)|
| 1:12:09| I mean, in some ways, what we're suggesting right here is the same thing that's already happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4329)|
| 1:12:13| when we were asked to send recommendations originally, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4333)|
| 1:12:17| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4337)|
| 1:12:18| I mean, we've been asked to do this once in this process already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4338)|
| 1:12:20| I just want to make sure it's the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4340)|
| 1:12:22| Well, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4342)|
| 1:12:23| I mean, the board asked the committee to come up with a tool,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4343)|
| 1:12:27| and I know there's some discussion about whether that was supposed to be just TSBA or a combination,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4347)|
| 1:12:35| but the committee has simply provided this recommendation to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4355)|
| 1:12:41| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4361)|
| 1:12:42| I mean, again, the board can, there's a motion on the floor now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4362)|
| 1:12:46| but, I mean, the board could have said, well, I don't like this at all collectively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4366)|
| 1:12:49| and let's all, you know, let's send it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4369)|
| 1:12:51| I mean, all deliberation is still in the hands of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4371)|
| 1:12:54| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4374)|
| 1:12:55| Ms. Coatney, you may remember this better than me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4375)|
| 1:12:57| I don't know, but this topic came up two or three months ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4377)|
| 1:13:00| where we referenced the fact that we had not yet gotten to this as a part of that process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4380)|
| 1:13:05| and we even retest the committee at that time, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4385)|
| 1:13:09| Yes, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4389)|
| 1:13:11| So the board voted, I believe, in January for the committee to continue their work with TSBA on a framework.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4391)|
| 1:13:17| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4397)|
| 1:13:18| And then after Ms. Satterfield spoke with Dr. Grissom at TSBA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4398)|
| 1:13:22| it was decided that we should probably wait on Dr. Ryswick's contract to be in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4402)|
| 1:13:26| so that she could gather the information from that contract to create the framework.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4406)|
| 1:13:31| And so that's why the committee work kind of got postponed for just a little while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4411)|
| 1:13:34| That contract was voted on in April, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4414)|
| 1:13:37| and then we met in May and June to get to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4417)|
| 1:13:41| So that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4421)|
| 1:13:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4422)|
| 1:13:43| I just think it's important when things get stretched out really far like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4423)|
| 1:13:46| all of us kind of lose a little bit about how it happened, and especially for the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4426)|
| 1:13:50| I want them to understand the thread of how we got here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4430)|
| 1:13:53| that this wasn't something that just magically showed up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4433)|
| 1:13:56| but it's the culmination of a lot of work is all I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4436)|
| 1:14:00| So thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4440)|
| 1:14:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4441)|
| 1:14:02| Board Member Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4442)|
| 1:14:03| Thank you, Madam Chair, Vice Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4443)|
| 1:14:06| I guess my concern is just, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4446)|
| 1:14:08| do you guys on the committee think that it's possible to get this done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4448)|
| 1:14:11| Because it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4451)|
| 1:14:12| I mean, it's really only two weeks, so it's not much time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4452)|
| 1:14:15| So I think that's the big question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4455)|
| 1:14:19| As the committee chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4459)|
| 1:14:20| it's really going to be dependent on how quickly other board members can provide the feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4460)|
| 1:14:25| So I guess even if you don't have feedback,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4465)|
| 1:14:27| if you can communicate that to Terry to say no feedback is necessary so that we can know when we have a number nine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4467)|
| 1:14:33| we can move forward with giving it to HR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4473)|
| 1:14:36| So the delay will be the board members' participation in doing what's asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4476)|
| 1:14:44| But other than that, I think the biggest goal from my perspective of the chair of the committee is getting this task done with the board at hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4484)|
| 1:14:54| So that goal has to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4494)|
| 1:14:56| I think the goal should be met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4496)|
| 1:14:58| Board Member McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4498)|
| 1:15:00| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4500)|
| 1:15:02| I was just going to follow up on what you said and ask what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4502)|
| 1:15:09| other than the fact that at least three members would not be able to participate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4509)|
| 1:15:21| what would happen if we waited, say, 90 days for the new board to go through all this process and everything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4521)|
| 1:15:36| I mean, would there be any harm done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4536)|
| 1:15:39| Because Dr. Reis, you know, basically understands what his expectations are, I think, at this point, generally speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4539)|
| 1:15:52| But, you know, all I'm saying is that I don't really see the need to rush through it unless there's something that I haven't heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4552)|
| 1:16:09| And then the new people that come on could catch up and we could vote for it, you know, 90 days down the road or whenever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4569)|
| 1:16:22| It would give everybody that wanted to review it, public, whoever, teachers, whatever, an opportunity to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4582)|
| 1:16:35| That's all I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4595)|
| 1:16:37| Would that hurt anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4597)|
| 1:16:39| I guess my question would be to you, Mr. Dufresne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4599)|
| 1:16:45| I would say it's completely up to the board, Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4605)|
| 1:16:49| Somehow or another I thought you might answer like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4609)|
| 1:16:52| Yeah, I think that that would be a board vote if we wanted to bring to a board vote if that is a motion that someone would need to present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4612)|
| 1:17:00| Again, my take on it is just from my perspective, this job was under this current board, so it's just finishing the task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4620)|
| 1:17:11| And that's really my only motive behind it is how do we complete the task that we started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4631)|
| 1:17:15| and not have expectations of giving this responsibility to somebody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4635)|
| 1:17:22| Board Member Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4642)|
| 1:17:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4643)|
| 1:17:24| I was just going to say since two of the committee members will then roll off the board in September,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4644)|
| 1:17:31| it would definitely have to be pushed out because you'd have to reform a committee to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4651)|
| 1:17:38| So that would be one consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4658)|
| 1:17:40| I think if you get into this and you feel like you can't accomplish it in that short amount of time, then I would certainly be for pushing it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4660)|
| 1:17:51| I don't think we should rush ahead if we don't feel like it's at a point that we feel like we can vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4671)|
| 1:18:01| I would prefer that we vote to go ahead and ask the committee to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4681)|
| 1:18:06| If you don't feel like you can accomplish that goal, then I think that that's your committee report when we get to August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4686)|
| 1:18:15| So looking at the calendar, we have the week of the 18th and the week of the 25th to be able to give feedback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4695)|
| 1:18:23| and then also give it to the department heads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4703)|
| 1:18:25| So department heads, that's helping us look at this tool, just being on notice that it might come late in the game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4705)|
| 1:18:33| Hopefully it won't be too bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4713)|
| 1:18:35| And then we'll have our board discussion on August 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4715)|
| 1:18:40| And so if you all can get your feedback in at least by the 27th, that would be ideal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4720)|
| 1:18:47| The sooner the better, but also if you're a board member that doesn't have any feedback, please just communicate that with Terry as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4727)|
| 1:18:53| Board member Henderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4733)|
| 1:18:55| Thank you, Madam Vice Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4735)|
| 1:18:56| Yeah, I was going to say if we get feedback in by the 22nd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4736)|
| 1:18:59| and that gives our committee and department heads that week to kind of go over that information and feedback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4739)|
| 1:19:05| and have that week to put that together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4745)|
| 1:19:10| That gives us like a week, a little bit over a week as board members to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4750)|
| 1:19:14| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4754)|
| 1:19:15| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4755)|
| 1:19:17| Cool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4757)|
| 1:19:19| Anything else on this topic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4759)|
| 1:19:20| Yes, board member Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4760)|
| 1:19:22| Sorry, Madam Vice Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4762)|
| 1:19:24| This will be my last comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4764)|
| 1:19:25| So can you just say that date one more time that you suggested to get things in by?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4765)|
| 1:19:28| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4768)|
| 1:19:29| So board members, if you can have your feedback in by July 22nd, which is a Friday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4769)|
| 1:19:34| and feedback is anything that you want to see changed on this evaluation tool that's been presented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4774)|
| 1:19:39| or communicating that you do not have any suggestions for change to Terry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4779)|
| 1:19:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4786)|
| 1:19:47| If that's the date you all are comfortable with, I would add to that friendly amendment to add that date in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4787)|
| 1:19:52| just so that way the committee knows that they're empowered to work on whatever information they have available at that date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4792)|
| 1:19:59| Regardless of who's answered what or how or when, 20 seconds to deadline after that date, whatever we got,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4799)|
| 1:20:04| that's what we're rolling with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4804)|
| 1:20:08| So can you repeat the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4808)|
| 1:20:14| I believe the motion is for the superintendent search committee to gather information from board members by July 22nd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4814)|
| 1:20:21| and bring back a proposed tool for consideration at the August meeting with work being reviewed by Human Resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4821)|
| 1:20:30| Research Evaluation and Assessment, and Superintendent Reiswick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4830)|
| 1:20:35| Motion made by Board Member Horne, seconded by Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4835)|
| 1:20:40| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4840)|
| 1:20:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4842)|
| 1:20:43| All opposed, same sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4843)|
| 1:20:46| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4846)|
| 1:20:48| Board members, you received email last Thursday, but I wanted to note for the public that Agenda Item 11C,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4848)|
| 1:20:54| for approval of our summer learning program grants to Tennessee Department of Education, was added after the agenda was published.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4854)|
| 1:21:03| Also, as everyone knows, the July 11th work session was canceled due to unforeseen circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4863)|
| 1:21:13| But in each session, Ms. Coatney will introduce the consent agenda and will entertain discussion on any consent items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4873)|
| 1:21:19| Then we'll read each of the board policy grants and contract and regular agenda items on record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4879)|
| 1:21:25| and then we can discuss those items at the appropriate time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4885)|
| 1:21:28| We do have people registered for public forum on some of our voting items, so they'll be called to speak on that particular item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4888)|
| 1:21:37| Oh, y'all want a break?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4897)|
| 1:21:48| We're going to take — oh, we're going to come back on time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4908)|
| 1:21:50| We're going to come back as the meeting adjourns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4910)|
| 1:21:53| The meeting will come back in session at 630.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4913)|
| 1:21:57| 630.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4917)|
| 1:21:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4918)|
| 1:21:59| Take a break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4919)|
| 1:22:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4925)|
| 1:22:07| Thank you so much, board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4927)|
| 1:22:09| We are calling this meeting back into order, so thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4929)|
| 1:22:13| If you could take your seats, that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4933)|
| 1:22:16| So as mentioned earlier, hopefully everyone — again, we had our work session that was canceled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4936)|
| 1:22:22| I will ask Ms. Coatney to introduce the consent agenda, and I will entertain discussion on any consent item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4942)|
| 1:22:28| Then we'll read each of the board policy grants and contracts and regular agenda items on the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4948)|
| 1:22:34| and then we'll discuss those items at the appropriate time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4954)|
| 1:22:37| And we do have people signed up for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4957)|
| 1:22:40| Board member Owen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4960)|
| 1:22:41| I'm just confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4961)|
| 1:22:44| Are you saying we're going through each consent agenda item, or we're going to pull some out as we see fit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4964)|
| 1:22:50| So I'll open the — Ms. Coatney will read the consent agenda, and then we'll open up for discussion for any of those items on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4970)|
| 1:22:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4977)|
| 1:22:58| And then we will vote for all of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4978)|
| 1:22:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4979)|
| 1:23:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4981)|
| 1:23:02| Ms. Coatney, take us away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4982)|
| 1:23:03| We have a non-consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4983)|
| 1:23:12| Board member Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4992)|
| 1:23:14| Thank you, Madam Vice Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4994)|
| 1:23:15| I have questions on item number seven, the NIET.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=4995)|
| 1:23:23| And I don't know who best to address this to, Dr. Eisenwick, you or someone else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5003)|
| 1:23:30| but if something can be said more about just the principal leadership network and the intention of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5010)|
| 1:23:36| if it's replacing something, am I addressing questions to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5016)|
| 1:23:43| It says Keith Wilson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5023)|
| 1:23:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5026)|
| 1:23:47| In defiance of Keith Wilson, are you here with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5027)|
| 1:23:50| I'm right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5030)|
| 1:23:51| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5031)|
| 1:23:52| Wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5032)|
| 1:23:53| He gave me a chair and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5033)|
| 1:23:55| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5035)|
| 1:23:56| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5036)|
| 1:23:57| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5037)|
| 1:23:58| Dr. Wilson, can you just say a little bit more about the principal leadership network,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5038)|
| 1:24:01| and is it replacing something, what its intention is, and how cohort members will be selected?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5041)|
| 1:24:07| And then finally, who's going to implement it with KCS?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5047)|
| 1:24:10| So I will be happy to share the level I have on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5050)|
| 1:24:13| And Julie Thompson, who's actually been kind of the point on the grant, is here as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5053)|
| 1:24:16| and so she may step into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5056)|
| 1:24:18| But I think the big picture of it is NIET is actually seeking some partners as part of the grant application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5058)|
| 1:24:25| they are making to expand some leadership development work with this seed grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5065)|
| 1:24:32| So they actually will serve as the recipient and fiscal agent for that grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5072)|
| 1:24:35| No funds really flow through Knox County on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5075)|
| 1:24:38| It does not necessarily replace anything currently that we're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5078)|
| 1:24:42| but it does give us another tool in our tool belt in terms of looking at developing the principal pipeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5082)|
| 1:24:48| I think the intent to start out would be to offer it in this first cohort to any principals that were interested in participating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5088)|
| 1:24:56| but then also to assistant principals once we've kind of vetted through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5096)|
| 1:25:00| And then the long term is, as we think about that principal development pipeline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5100)|
| 1:25:06| being able to offer some learning opportunities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5106)|
| 1:25:10| and this could be one of those that would help us look towards the AP pool and ranks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5110)|
| 1:25:16| and see those that are seeking out development opportunities and have engaged in certain ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5116)|
| 1:25:20| And so we see that as an opportunity to put another opportunity in front of them, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5120)|
| 1:25:25| Thank you. And who's leading the implementation in Knox County Schools of the network?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5125)|
| 1:25:29| That might be a Julie question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5129)|
| 1:25:31| That's fine. I can ask her. Oh, you said she is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5131)|
| 1:25:34| Julie, do you care to come up and answer that? Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5134)|
| 1:25:38| Thank you, Ms. Thompson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5138)|
| 1:25:48| I'm sorry, who's leading the implementation of the principal leadership network?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5148)|
| 1:25:52| So I am currently the person that's been designated to oversee that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5152)|
| 1:25:57| It's important to note that the grant has just been applied for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5157)|
| 1:26:00| We won't know until September whether or not NIET has actually received the grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5160)|
| 1:26:07| And so at that point, if in fact they do receive the grant, and we hope that they do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5167)|
| 1:26:12| then I'll be the person working between NIET.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5172)|
| 1:26:16| How many times have you actually been the answer to a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5176)|
| 1:26:19| So you were the answer. Thank you. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5179)|
| 1:26:25| Board member Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5185)|
| 1:26:28| Thank you, Madam Chair. I also have concern about the same thing, the NIET contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5188)|
| 1:26:35| The fiscal note says that there's no cost to the district, and while there isn't a monetary cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5195)|
| 1:26:43| if you look at, I guess it's the third page from the end, looking at the seed and matching funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5203)|
| 1:26:54| fellows will commit an average of three hours per week to the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5214)|
| 1:26:58| So if we are expecting our principals to put in an additional three hours per week for this project as the match on this grant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5218)|
| 1:27:09| that does have a cost to the district because that additional three hours that they're putting in is significant to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5229)|
| 1:27:17| So that's a concern to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5237)|
| 1:27:19| I'm also concerned that we are considering this part of our pipeline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5239)|
| 1:27:28| because we're not just asking people to put in these three hours per week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5248)|
| 1:27:33| We're also implying that this will give them a greater chance of being selected, and that's quite an ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5253)|
| 1:27:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5264)|
| 1:27:54| It was a question? It's not a question. It's a statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5274)|
| 1:27:59| It's not a question. It's a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5279)|
| 1:28:02| So if I could speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5282)|
| 1:28:06| The in-kind contribution comes in that it will happen during their regular school day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5286)|
| 1:28:13| and so in essence Knox County Schools will be paying them during the time that they're doing this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5293)|
| 1:28:20| So this would be something that they would be doing during their regular school day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5300)|
| 1:28:26| and they would receive professional leave for that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5306)|
| 1:28:32| So then that's absolutely a cost to Knox County Schools if they are receiving leave during that three hours a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5312)|
| 1:28:40| That's the in-kind contribution that we make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5320)|
| 1:28:43| So when we look at that, it's not a budgetary cost to Knox County Schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5323)|
| 1:28:50| but it's a cost because we have the leader in our building who is doing something else during those three hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5330)|
| 1:28:56| That's my concern, is that that's where the cost is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5336)|
| 1:28:59| is that we are taking three hours a week from that school for that principal to do something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5339)|
| 1:29:05| Superintendent Risewood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5345)|
| 1:29:07| Thank you, and thanks, Ms. Owens, for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5347)|
| 1:29:10| I see this a lot like professional development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5350)|
| 1:29:15| If a principal or a teacher is going to a professional development conference or doing something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5355)|
| 1:29:21| that yes, there could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5361)|
| 1:29:22| I mean, they're not in their classroom or in their school during that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5362)|
| 1:29:25| So you're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5365)|
| 1:29:27| I mean, that would be, in my opinion, equivalent to any other professional development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5367)|
| 1:29:32| I also wanted to address this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5372)|
| 1:29:35| We're not trying to create a preferred way to become an administrator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5375)|
| 1:29:40| This is not a signal for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5380)|
| 1:29:42| What we're trying to do is look at over the course of the last three to five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5382)|
| 1:29:45| there's been limited professional growth opportunities for administrators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5385)|
| 1:29:49| So when we have an organization like NIET or we have local colleges, we have other relays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5389)|
| 1:29:55| Another example of we have three people in a leadership training program that was part of that package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5395)|
| 1:30:00| We're just trying to provide high-quality leadership development for aspiring principals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5400)|
| 1:30:05| assistant principals that are interested in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5405)|
| 1:30:09| We don't have a formal way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5409)|
| 1:30:11| And as superintendent, I don't think we need a way to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5411)|
| 1:30:15| I think there are a lot of high-quality programs and universities and colleges that provide great programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5415)|
| 1:30:21| We just want to make sure we're providing, especially when something is of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5421)|
| 1:30:25| dolitary budget cost, we're not paying that, but we are, I understand, with someone's question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5425)|
| 1:30:30| And so this was an opportunity for us from my understanding that they had done some of this in South Carolina.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5430)|
| 1:30:35| We could put 20 to 25 of our aspiring folks, give them a leadership, some development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5435)|
| 1:30:41| and a chance if they wanted to to see if they wanted to kind of aspire to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5441)|
| 1:30:44| But, you know, there's no, you know, this isn't a route to the principalship or to the assistant principalship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5444)|
| 1:30:49| This is another growth opportunity that we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5449)|
| 1:30:54| Board Member Allen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5454)|
| 1:30:57| I think what you just said is very confusing for administrators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5457)|
| 1:31:01| because while you're saying this is another growth opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5461)|
| 1:31:04| and Dr. Wilson is saying that we would be looking at growth opportunities for that principal pipeline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5464)|
| 1:31:13| that this is a growth opportunity that we would be looking at for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5473)|
| 1:31:18| So I think that's something to really consider what we're really saying to principals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5478)|
| 1:31:26| Is this just a growth opportunity or is this a growth expectation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5486)|
| 1:31:31| Because we've said two different things tonight, and if I were looking at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5491)|
| 1:31:38| I would think that this was a growth expectation from what I've heard tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5498)|
| 1:31:43| How many weeks is the program? For how many weeks are they giving three hours?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5503)|
| 1:31:49| So there are three cohorts. One will begin in January of 23.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5509)|
| 1:31:56| It will run through December of that year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5516)|
| 1:32:03| And then there will be another cohort that begins July of 23 and runs for a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5523)|
| 1:32:10| And then a third one that begins July of 24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5530)|
| 1:32:14| So for how many weeks are principals giving three hours per week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5534)|
| 1:32:21| It averages three hours a week, but there's going to be times like there are five days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5541)|
| 1:32:31| that will be a full day, and then there will be seven virtual days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5551)|
| 1:32:38| and there will be five in-person days where a representative from NIET will be coming to the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5558)|
| 1:32:45| to assist the principal in their identified problem of practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5565)|
| 1:32:49| So it is just-in-time professional development based on the needs at the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5569)|
| 1:32:56| And then they will also be able to go to the national conference in the spring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5576)|
| 1:33:02| and the Summer Institute in the summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5582)|
| 1:33:04| Are those in addition to these three hours per week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5584)|
| 1:33:07| That's included in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5587)|
| 1:33:11| Board Member Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5591)|
| 1:33:14| Thank you, Madam Vice Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5594)|
| 1:33:15| So, Ms. Thompson, do you know roughly the total hours that somebody would invest?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5595)|
| 1:33:20| I know it gets pulled out in different ways, but do you have any sense of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5600)|
| 1:33:25| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5605)|
| 1:33:26| Okay, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5606)|
| 1:33:27| I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5607)|
| 1:33:28| And then, Dr. Reiswick, I completely agree with Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5608)|
| 1:33:32| I think there is some conflicting messaging, and I think what I'm hearing is when I heard pipeline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5612)|
| 1:33:37| I heard this is the on-ramp to become a principal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5617)|
| 1:33:40| And so maybe-I mean, my suggestion, I'm not trying to be nitpicky,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5620)|
| 1:33:43| is maybe if we just move away from that language of pipeline and try to clean up that-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5623)|
| 1:33:47| what I heard you say is this is an item on a professional development menu for administrators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5627)|
| 1:33:54| that's very different than a pipeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5634)|
| 1:33:57| Here's how you get to become an administrator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5637)|
| 1:33:59| So, to me, that's kind of what I'm hearing in some of this, and I think that could be confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5639)|
| 1:34:04| But I do value us providing additional opportunities for our administrators for professional development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5644)|
| 1:34:10| because some jobs, some positions have more ample opportunities than others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5650)|
| 1:34:15| And sometimes when you're at the top, that's when it gets harder to get the professional development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5655)|
| 1:34:19| because you're making sure everybody else is getting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5659)|
| 1:34:23| Senator Ryslick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5663)|
| 1:34:24| Thanks. I appreciate that comment, and I'm aware of our history in that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5664)|
| 1:34:29| There was a time in our past that we kind of had a pipeline to get there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5669)|
| 1:34:35| and I'm committed that we don't need a pipeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5675)|
| 1:34:38| There's lots of quality programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5678)|
| 1:34:40| But I will say that there is an expectation that our future leaders are trying to grow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5680)|
| 1:34:46| and continue to grow in things, and so I think it's the district for us to provide opportunities for that to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5686)|
| 1:34:51| But I think you said that well, this is not the pipeline to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5691)|
| 1:34:54| This is another professional opportunity growth that they can bring back and help us in the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5694)|
| 1:34:58| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5698)|
| 1:35:00| Board Member Bounds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5700)|
| 1:35:01| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5701)|
| 1:35:03| And, yes, I understand what Jennifer was trying to convey, and I appreciate your comments, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5703)|
| 1:35:08| And I really appreciate your clarity in that because few of us know the history in this institution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5708)|
| 1:35:16| And knowing that, I think it will be very important how that is conveyed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5716)|
| 1:35:21| and I hear what you're saying and hope that you can convey that to those that are participating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5721)|
| 1:35:27| But also, it will be very indicative of who gets hired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5727)|
| 1:35:32| So that's something also, you know, like not intentionally conveying this is a pipeline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5732)|
| 1:35:40| but if a high percentage of those people that have experienced or done NEET get hired over other avenues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5740)|
| 1:35:52| or whatever you want to call it that people can take, then indirectly it will send a message that this is the pipeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5752)|
| 1:36:00| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5760)|
| 1:36:02| So not that you have to have quotas, but I think it's very important as you hire in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5762)|
| 1:36:09| that that is not conveyed, that if you do this, then you are assured that you will have a principalship waiting for you in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5769)|
| 1:36:19| And not everyone understands it, I understand, but I know you do, and I appreciate your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5779)|
| 1:36:26| Board Member Allwin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5786)|
| 1:36:28| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5788)|
| 1:36:29| Ms. Bounds, I appreciate you saying it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5789)|
| 1:36:31| That makes a lot of clarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5791)|
| 1:36:34| I'd also like to do some math in public, even though I don't want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5794)|
| 1:36:40| If I've done this sort of right, we're looking at about 96 hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5800)|
| 1:36:45| if we are only looking at those five full days in person and seven full virtual days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5805)|
| 1:36:53| That's about 96 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5813)|
| 1:36:55| So my ask is that when we are looking at programs like this and encouraging our administrators to do them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5815)|
| 1:37:01| that the administration really consider the cost, because that 96 hours is a cost to our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5821)|
| 1:37:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5830)|
| 1:37:12| Board Member Horn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5832)|
| 1:37:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5834)|
| 1:37:15| I would just say that I understand the concerns, and I appreciate you voicing them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5835)|
| 1:37:20| because I think that our history, it's just a concern that we need to make sure that we're continually aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5840)|
| 1:37:26| And at the same time, I do appreciate the opportunity for principals and assistant principals to have professional development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5846)|
| 1:37:33| because when I go back to that conversation that we had some years ago regarding principal development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5853)|
| 1:37:39| it's so important, and I feel like that's been a weakness over the last several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5859)|
| 1:37:44| So I do think that it needs to be, we need to be paying particular attention to development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5864)|
| 1:37:51| and it is difficult, because our principals are pulled in so many directions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5871)|
| 1:37:55| and they have so many responsibilities in their building alone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5875)|
| 1:37:59| and I definitely am concerned about the amount of time that principals are out of their buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5879)|
| 1:38:06| because I do hear that as a concern when I'm visiting schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5886)|
| 1:38:09| So there's definitely a balance, and so I think we just have to be very careful with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5889)|
| 1:38:15| At the same time, we have to continue to develop our leadership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5895)|
| 1:38:19| because our schools are only going to be as strong as our leaders are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5899)|
| 1:38:24| So while we have to be aware of that, I think as district leaders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5904)|
| 1:38:29| we just need to be mindful of making sure that we're guarding their time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5909)|
| 1:38:33| and making sure that any time principals are being asked to do anything that's going to take them away from their day-to-day assistance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5913)|
| 1:38:43| to educators in the school and service to students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5923)|
| 1:38:46| we just need to make sure that we're being mindful of it and that it's definitely needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5926)|
| 1:38:51| So anyway, long way to say. I think I'm happy that we're doing additional development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5931)|
| 1:38:57| I would like to see other opportunities for principals to develop and continue to grow in what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5937)|
| 1:39:05| Thank you. Any other consent agenda items we need to discuss?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5945)|
| 1:39:15| So we have a motion by Bormer Watson, a second by Bormer Milhorn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=5955)|

| 1:41:53| We do have, Vice Chair Satterfield, we do have public forum on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6113)|
| 1:42:00| Erin Keek, Keck, sorry, I know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6120)|
| 1:42:05| Please state your name, county of residence, and you'll have three minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6125)|
| 1:42:15| Can you hear? Okay, all right. Erin Keek, Knox County resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6135)|
| 1:42:20| I didn't have the benefit of hearing the discussion related to this matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6140)|
| 1:42:23| since we didn't have the meeting on Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6143)|
| 1:42:25| so I'm just going to have to make some assumptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6145)|
| 1:42:28| But I'm going to view my opinion about the amended change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6148)|
| 1:42:33| Any time that our ability to come and speak in a public forum is limited,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6153)|
| 1:42:39| I have an issue with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6159)|
| 1:42:42| I think that this board talks a lot about wanting to hear from the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6162)|
| 1:42:46| but any time we've had the option to actually put those words into action, you fail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6166)|
| 1:42:52| And so I know that previously we voted to shorten the time that we could talk at public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6172)|
| 1:42:58| And now it looks as though we're wanting to limit us being able to sign up the same day to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6178)|
| 1:43:03| that we need to know the day before at 4 o'clock that we want to speak, 24 hours in advance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6183)|
| 1:43:09| Or if we wanted to speak at a Monday meeting, we would need to know Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6189)|
| 1:43:14| I think that, again, limiting our ability to come and speak is not in the best interest of any of us as parents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6194)|
| 1:43:21| teachers, community members, especially for –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6201)|
| 1:43:26| well, first let me just propose that we maybe look at some alternates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6206)|
| 1:43:30| instead of just completely wiping out the ability to sign up the day of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6210)|
| 1:43:33| Maybe we have an online forum of a way to sign up the day of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6213)|
| 1:43:37| Maybe it ends at a certain time in the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6217)|
| 1:43:39| I know we don't want to put more on dear, sweet Ms. Coatney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6219)|
| 1:43:43| She's just one of the nicest KCS employees I've ever met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6223)|
| 1:43:46| But I think that maybe we could ask her, would she be willing to take those calls up until noon the day of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6226)|
| 1:43:51| I just think that getting rid of one of these options without any alternates is kind of a blow to some of us that appreciate that option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6231)|
| 1:43:59| We have board members now that are seeking reelection running on a platform of wanting to be the voice for the parent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6239)|
| 1:44:05| I appreciate that, but I don't need that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6245)|
| 1:44:08| I can speak for myself, and I'd like to continue to have the opportunity to do that as freely as is possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6248)|
| 1:44:15| So really that's all I have to say about this topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6255)|
| 1:44:19| I would like to hear all of you guys supporting teachers publicly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6259)|
| 1:44:23| I wish that we had started this meeting with some kind of declaration about how much we support our teachers in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6263)|
| 1:44:29| I hear you saying it when they come and present it, but right now they need to hear it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6269)|
| 1:44:33| I, as a parent and a community member, support Knox County's teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6273)|
| 1:44:38| I think they are very highly educated professionals, and we need them in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6278)|
| 1:44:43| And you guys, as district leaders, have a unique opportunity to support them, advocate for them, and I think you should take that seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6283)|
| 1:44:52| One last thing on public forum, when we come and speak and you get on your phone, super rude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6292)|
| 1:44:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6297)|
| 1:44:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6298)|
| 1:44:59| That concludes public forum on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6299)|
| 1:45:11| We need a motion to bring it to the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6311)|
| 1:45:21| For the item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6321)|
| 1:45:26| Motion carried by Board Member Horan, seconded by Bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6326)|
| 1:45:29| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6329)|
| 1:45:32| Board Member Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6332)|
| 1:45:35| Thank you, Madam Vice Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6335)|
| 1:45:36| I know this was discussed at policy review this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6336)|
| 1:45:39| I'm losing track of when things happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6339)|
| 1:45:44| But we also know that even though those are up to the public, not many folks from the public get to do that because it's during the middle of the day when we have those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6344)|
| 1:45:53| I remember vaguely somebody speaking in that meeting to that this was the way that we're currently doing it instead of letting people sign up the day of and even up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6353)|
| 1:46:03| I mean, even at the meeting has not always been the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6363)|
| 1:46:06| Can somebody speak definitively and kind of trace a little bit of history of that for us and and how we got there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6366)|
| 1:46:14| Would that be you, Terry or Gary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6374)|
| 1:46:18| I'm not asking you to be definitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6378)|
| 1:46:20| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6380)|
| 1:46:21| And I'm happy to try Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6381)|
| 1:46:23| So I've been in this role for a little over a decade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6383)|
| 1:46:27| And when when I first started in this position, public forum was five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6387)|
| 1:46:33| You could sign up all the way up into the meeting time and fairly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6393)|
| 1:46:41| This board has been very generous with that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6401)|
| 1:46:43| And so looking at surveys from across the state and talking to TSPA and across the years, it became clear that the board members wanted to get as many comments as they could from the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6403)|
| 1:46:58| And so the time sort of became shorter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6418)|
| 1:47:01| I think in the last couple of years, even that three minutes, there was a night when we had over 100 public forum speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6421)|
| 1:47:07| And in the interest of wanting to hear from everyone, that time limit got shortened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6427)|
| 1:47:12| And so I think that was a lot of the reason behind that move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6432)|
| 1:47:16| And then as far as signing up, it becomes sort of an issue for the board vice chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6436)|
| 1:47:20| Miss Satterfield, you let me know if this isn't true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6440)|
| 1:47:23| But when people sign up the day before, I have the opportunity to get all their information, their register.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6443)|
| 1:47:29| We know what topics they're speaking to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6449)|
| 1:47:31| It's very orderly that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6451)|
| 1:47:33| When people come to sign up at the meeting, if they're running just a few minutes late,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6453)|
| 1:47:38| there have been a few issues with people wanting to sign up their friends and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6458)|
| 1:47:43| And so it does become sort of a, it creates a little bit of an issue for the vice chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6463)|
| 1:47:47| I don't know how difficult that is, but I think those are just a few of the reasons why this recommendation was just brought forth for you all to consider too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6467)|
| 1:47:57| I think other boards across the state have this same type of policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6477)|
| 1:48:01| Mr. Dupler, I know you looked into it very thoroughly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6481)|
| 1:48:04| Yeah, that's what I would add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6484)|
| 1:48:06| Again, this is a decision for the board to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6486)|
| 1:48:08| I mean, it's not a legal decision because you're not limiting content of free speech whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6488)|
| 1:48:15| This is simply limiting time and place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6495)|
| 1:48:19| And as Miss Coatney said, across the state, I looked at board policy after board policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6499)|
| 1:48:27| and I struggled to find another policy that said you could just sign up right up until the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6507)|
| 1:48:36| But again, it's back to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6516)|
| 1:48:38| I mean, the board can decide to adopt this or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6518)|
| 1:48:41| I mean, there's no legal restriction in this change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6521)|
| 1:48:49| Is there any, sorry, does that still have the floor? Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6529)|
| 1:48:52| Is there anything in state law that addresses the mechanics of signing up and limitations on that in terms of how people sign up and not when?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6532)|
| 1:49:03| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6543)|
| 1:49:05| Matter of fact, state law is that this board doesn't even have to have public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6545)|
| 1:49:11| But traditionally, as Miss Coatney talks about, this board's been very open to the public and welcoming to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6551)|
| 1:49:19| But I will say that if this board decides to have a public forum policy, which it has for many, many years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6559)|
| 1:49:26| then that policy has to be administered correctly and open to free speech, as we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6566)|
| 1:49:32| But again, this is not a content restriction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6572)|
| 1:49:34| This is time and place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6574)|
| 1:49:36| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6576)|
| 1:49:37| So going back to that discussion, I think one of the things that really came across to me as a potential challenge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6577)|
| 1:49:44| and one of the things that I've seen happen a lot over this past year is it does become a bit of a free-for-all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6584)|
| 1:49:49| when people are coming straight up and trying to sign up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6589)|
| 1:49:51| And I have heard where people are trying to sign up other people or they're not even using their name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6591)|
| 1:49:57| They're kind of speaking as if they are somebody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6597)|
| 1:49:59| And I think some of that was the intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6599)|
| 1:50:02| Personally, if people want to argue with me about this in the public, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6602)|
| 1:50:07| I feel like I've always tried to be very open to hearing from anybody who's reached out to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6607)|
| 1:50:12| and I want us to continue to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6612)|
| 1:50:14| I actually don't think public forum is the best place to get your voice across to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6614)|
| 1:50:19| I'm not saying people shouldn't come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6619)|
| 1:50:21| I'm not saying anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6621)|
| 1:50:23| But from a board member's perspective, I honestly believe that most board members come to this meeting with their decision made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6623)|
| 1:50:30| I can't imagine, and I'm not trying to speak for everybody, that too many people have been influenced to change their vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6630)|
| 1:50:38| because of what was said in a public meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6638)|
| 1:50:40| Now, some people have. I don't know that I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6640)|
| 1:50:42| And it's not because I don't want to hear from people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6642)|
| 1:50:44| It's because I've already done my work before I got there, and I'm trying to make that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6644)|
| 1:50:49| What I would like to see us do as a way to elevate that voice in the community and not just tokenize it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6649)|
| 1:50:58| Dr. Eisewick, I've been playing with this, and we can talk more about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6658)|
| 1:51:01| but I'd like for us to consider some things like with this regional structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6661)|
| 1:51:05| Is there a way for us to have some regional listening sessions where we really go out proactively to the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6665)|
| 1:51:11| and ask for feedback and hear from the community, not when there's a problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6671)|
| 1:51:16| because what ends up happening in public forum is it often becomes when people are frustrated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6676)|
| 1:51:20| which they need to have an outlet at that moment, which is why I think we need to keep public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6680)|
| 1:51:25| But I also think that as a board, if we really want to hear from the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6685)|
| 1:51:28| it needs to be a proactive thing where we're going to the community to ask to hear from the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6688)|
| 1:51:33| not just waiting until somebody's mad and angry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6693)|
| 1:51:36| So I hear you, Ms. Keck, but I don't think that the nuance of when people can sign up is our solution to hearing from folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6696)|
| 1:51:45| I think there's other strategies that we need to be thinking about and implementing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6705)|
| 1:51:49| and I don't know that necessarily this change is going to impede greatly one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6709)|
| 1:51:54| I just think we need to be creative about how do we do that proactively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6714)|
| 1:51:58| So because of the confusion that I've seen it create a lot over this last two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6718)|
| 1:52:03| I think I'm going to support this change, but I do want us to be proactive as a board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6723)|
| 1:52:09| and I really like the idea of using this regional structure maybe as an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6729)|
| 1:52:14| and a way to be more intentional and proactive about going to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6734)|
| 1:52:18| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6738)|
| 1:52:22| So I would just speak to it a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6742)|
| 1:52:24| So I wasn't at the policy review, so I don't know the conversation that was had there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6744)|
| 1:52:28| All I know is the conversation that we're having now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6748)|
| 1:52:30| and as somebody who was an advocate for bringing it to three minutes down, I'll try to do 90 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6750)|
| 1:52:39| I do feel like chipping away at this part doesn't get to the bigger conversation that you just brought up, Watson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6759)|
| 1:52:46| of how can we really utilize public forum to where it's effective to understand where our constituents are coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6766)|
| 1:52:54| So I'm not going to support it just on the strength of I don't know if chipping away at this part gets to that root cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6774)|
| 1:53:01| But other than that, I think that there's bigger concerns when it comes to how to engage the public that we should as a board address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6781)|
| 1:53:10| Board member Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6790)|
| 1:53:13| Thank you, Madam Vice Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6793)|
| 1:53:15| I'm going to have to vote no on this just because we did limit it to three minutes earlier in the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6795)|
| 1:53:20| and I don't want to limit anybody any further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6800)|
| 1:53:24| So I am not going to be supporting this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6804)|
| 1:53:28| But with that said, I also love Daniel's idea of now that we have the regions of doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6808)|
| 1:53:33| being more proactive of holding those community chats or community listening and learn sessions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6813)|
| 1:53:43| Board member Bounce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6823)|
| 1:53:45| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6825)|
| 1:53:46| Having been on both sides, on that side as an educator and on this side as a board member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6826)|
| 1:53:53| and having served two terms as chair, I am going to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6833)|
| 1:53:58| I don't think it hinders anybody's ability to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6838)|
| 1:54:03| I do like your idea, Mr. Watson, and I hope that Superintendent Roswick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6843)|
| 1:54:07| you all can work out something where you can have more dialogue with the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6847)|
| 1:54:14| I'll be going off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6854)|
| 1:54:15| But I think if somebody, it just presents a lot of problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6855)|
| 1:54:21| At the start of a meeting, we're trying to get the meeting started,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6861)|
| 1:54:24| and I think there is just a lot of confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6864)|
| 1:54:27| I've seen both sides try to rally support and get people at the last minute to come speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6867)|
| 1:54:33| I think if you're passionate about an item and you want to share your opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6873)|
| 1:54:39| you can know that at 5 o'clock the day before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6879)|
| 1:54:43| it alleviates a lot of headaches for Ms. Coatney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6883)|
| 1:54:48| So I will be supporting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6888)|
| 1:54:50| I appreciate Ms. Henderson and you, Ms. Satterfield, and your reasons for not doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6890)|
| 1:54:57| But having been an educator and having sat in that chair for two terms, I will support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6897)|
| 1:55:05| Board member McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6905)|
| 1:55:07| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6907)|
| 1:55:09| Just a comment in reference to what you were proposing as far as regional type thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6909)|
| 1:55:18| And times have changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6918)|
| 1:55:21| Something might work if it was approached correctly, but I do know this for a fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6921)|
| 1:55:32| The two at-large county commissioners, not the ones that are presently serving, but the prior administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6932)|
| 1:55:48| they did, I think it was once a quarter, and they went to, it was well announced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6948)|
| 1:55:56| they went to restaurants usually, and then whoever's district they were in, that made three county commissioners there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6956)|
| 1:56:10| And there was very, very little, and sometimes people, and they were well-known individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6970)|
| 1:56:21| Name recognition was not difficult with either one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6981)|
| 1:56:27| But they just, sometimes people would just come and talk, but they didn't want to talk about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6987)|
| 1:56:35| they weren't griping about anything, they just wanted to come and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=6995)|
| 1:56:41| just talk about how happy they were or whatever, how much they enjoyed them or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7001)|
| 1:56:50| Anyway, that's my only comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7010)|
| 1:56:53| I will support this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7013)|
| 1:56:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7016)|
| 1:56:57| Board Member Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7017)|
| 1:56:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7018)|
| 1:57:00| So one of the issues that, well, first of all, I think Mr. Watson made some really good points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7020)|
| 1:57:05| and I love the idea of doing more of those listening sessions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7025)|
| 1:57:10| And I think that it is important that if you have something that you need to tell the board that you tell us ahead of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7030)|
| 1:57:17| because, you know, we're spending the week prior to the meeting gathering information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7037)|
| 1:57:21| So if you have an issue, it's important that you email the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7041)|
| 1:57:24| And then come and speak also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7044)|
| 1:57:26| I think both is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7046)|
| 1:57:28| The other thing that I think that, I don't know if I said it in our policy review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7048)|
| 1:57:32| but I remember thinking about it, as some people have said, on the day of the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7052)|
| 1:57:37| I've even gotten text messages, you know, right at the beginning of the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7057)|
| 1:57:42| or even, like, during the meeting for people that want to be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7062)|
| 1:57:45| And it just puts the chair and the vice chair in a difficult position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7065)|
| 1:57:50| because we want to honor everybody that wants to speak, but it just puts you in a bad position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7070)|
| 1:57:56| and it is kind of loosey-goosey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7076)|
| 1:57:59| And so that's the reason that when we were discussing this in policy review that I thought it was a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7079)|
| 1:58:07| So I still think it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7087)|
| 1:58:10| I understand the concerns, and it does give you a shorter time period to be able to review the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7090)|
| 1:58:17| But I think that Ms. Coatney and the leadership, the chair and the superintendent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7097)|
| 1:58:22| are trying to get those agendas out well in advance so that people have time to look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7102)|
| 1:58:27| So I plan to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7107)|
| 1:58:29| Superintendent Reisman, do you have something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7109)|
| 1:58:31| I saw you move, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7111)|
| 1:58:32| No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7112)|
| 1:58:33| Okay, cool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7113)|
| 1:58:34| I was curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7114)|
| 1:58:36| Board Member Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7116)|
| 1:58:38| Thank you, Madam Vice Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7118)|
| 1:58:39| I don't know if this plays into people's decision-making,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7119)|
| 1:58:41| but also remember that the board approved our calendar for this coming year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7121)|
| 1:58:45| and our meeting times will shift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7125)|
| 1:58:48| So they'll move from Mondays and Wednesdays to Mondays and Thursdays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7128)|
| 1:58:51| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7131)|
| 1:58:53| So it gives a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7133)|
| 1:58:54| I mean, it's not the week that we used to have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7134)|
| 1:58:56| but it gives a little bit more time for people who want to come speak to be able to make that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7136)|
| 1:59:01| If something really crazy happened on Monday and it's like, hey, I've got to take two days to kind of think about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7141)|
| 1:59:06| because I think the sign-up date then would be pushed to the Wednesday, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7146)|
| 1:59:10| Yeah, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7150)|
| 1:59:12| Board Member Allwin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7152)|
| 1:59:13| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7153)|
| 1:59:14| The concern that I've heard regarding the sign-up is from the time that the agenda is published to the Monday meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7154)|
| 1:59:25| because they would have to sign up by Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7165)|
| 1:59:28| And so there's some concern there that, you know, that change in the calendar doesn't impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7168)|
| 1:59:36| This last thing I would like to say, as serving in the vice chair capacity, it hasn't been a problem for me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7176)|
| 1:59:42| but I also think that's a personality type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7182)|
| 1:59:44| So I don't know whose problem it will be moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7184)|
| 1:59:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7188)|
| 1:59:49| So we have a motion on the floor by Board Member Horn, seconded by Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7189)|
| 1:59:55| Bounce. Bounce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7195)|
| 1:59:58| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7198)|
| 2:00:01| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7201)|
| 2:00:02| All opposed, same sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7202)|
| 2:00:04| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7204)|
| 2:00:07| We can do a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7207)|
| 2:00:13| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7213)|

| 2:00:19| Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7219)|
| 2:00:20| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7220)|
| 2:00:21| Ms. Bounce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7221)|
| 2:00:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7222)|
| 2:00:23| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7223)|
| 2:00:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7224)|
| 2:00:25| Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7225)|
| 2:00:26| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7226)|
| 2:00:27| That is four yes votes and three no votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7227)|
| 2:00:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7229)|
| 2:00:30| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7230)|
| 2:00:31| Oh, you have the five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7231)|
| 2:00:34| So it fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7234)|
| 2:00:35| Motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7235)|

| 2:00:45| Just to let you know that when I asked Dr. Roswick, when I went across the room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7245)|
| 2:00:49| I asked him to move his microphone so that it wouldn't be in Ms. Satterfield's face on camera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7249)|
| 2:00:55| Blocking my face?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7255)|

| 2:01:40| Thank you, Madam Vice Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7300)|
| 2:01:42| Can I ask Mr. Dupler to just kind of speak a little bit to this policy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7302)|
| 2:01:46| I know we discussed it in policy review about the school support organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7306)|
| 2:01:50| I've heard from a few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7310)|
| 2:01:52| I've heard a few concerns this week, so I just want him to kind of go over it a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7312)|
| 2:01:56| And I also want to make a small change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7316)|
| 2:01:58| I don't know if that means it pushes it back to policy review, or do we vote on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7318)|
| 2:02:02| But can you speak to the background of this a little bit, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7322)|
| 2:02:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7325)|
| 2:02:06| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7326)|
| 2:02:07| Thank you, Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7327)|
| 2:02:08| And I may ask Garrett Radin to come up and talk about it as well, because he and I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7328)|
| 2:02:13| dealt with this policy off and on for probably the better part of five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7333)|
| 2:02:18| And when this policy first came up with the two of us dealing with school support organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7338)|
| 2:02:27| we read it as employees having or not wanting them to have the ability to get into financial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7347)|
| 2:02:38| situations, and particularly some compromising financial situations with a school support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7358)|
| 2:02:44| organization when they are an employee of Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7364)|
| 2:02:48| And several years ago, there was a discussion with some school support organizations, frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7368)|
| 2:02:55| PTOs, PTAs, about the fact that this wording in this policy is based upon the Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7375)|
| 2:03:02| Internal School Uniform Accounting Manual, which is always a mouthful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7382)|
| 2:03:06| But it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7386)|
| 2:03:08| So that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7388)|
| 2:03:10| So the discussion was there's some gray area there, because this policy uses the word| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7390)|
| 2:03:16| representative instead of employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7396)|
| 2:03:19| And by using the word representative in the accounting manual, I mean, there are some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7399)|
| 2:03:25| definitions in there that point to that person maybe being a principal as opposed to a teacher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7405)|
| 2:03:31| or another employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7411)|
| 2:03:33| So there's been some gray area here for some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7413)|
| 2:03:38| But when we look to best practices, and when we look to the fact that there have been instances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7418)|
| 2:03:44| although rare, fortunately, where we've had school support organization officers who have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7424)|
| 2:03:54| done things they shouldn't with school support organization money, that's very concerning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7434)|
| 2:04:01| if that officer is an employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7441)|
| 2:04:04| And by this change, we are looking at, again, best practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7444)|
| 2:04:08| What protects our employees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7448)|
| 2:04:11| And we're not saying that an employee cannot serve as an officer of an organization, simply that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7451)|
| 2:04:18| one, an employee should not be the treasurer, because the treasurer's sole duty is to keep up with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7458)|
| 2:04:23| the finances of the organization, nor should that officer have a direct signatory on the bank account| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7463)|
| 2:04:30| if that officer is an employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7470)|
| 2:04:35| Garrett Radin, is there anything I'm leaving out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7475)|
| 2:04:38| Okay, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7478)|
| 2:04:43| Thank you, board members, Dr. Reiswig, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7483)|
| 2:04:47| The main thing here is just a best practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7487)|
| 2:04:50| That's all we're doing is we're just strengthening a best practice to protect the employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7490)|
| 2:04:56| That's all we're trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7496)|
| 2:04:57| So whenever that time comes, hopefully it doesn't, but if it does, we're protecting that employee from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7497)|
| 2:05:03| any wrongdoing they can't do or maybe vendetta-driven that the public may think they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7503)|
| 2:05:13| So that is the best practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7513)|
| 2:05:14| And that comes from audit expectations in my world that I used to live in for 10 years or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7514)|
| 2:05:22| And honestly, I think this is just – Gary said it well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7522)|
| 2:05:26| It's not meant to mean that a substitute teacher can't be a board representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7526)|
| 2:05:32| It just means that they can't serve in this role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7532)|
| 2:05:35| They can serve in that role, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7535)|
| 2:05:38| Well said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7538)|
| 2:05:39| Yeah, and we don't want school employees to have that liability, right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7539)|
| 2:05:45| because if money is missing out of a school support organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7545)|
| 2:05:50| then obviously the treasurer is up to bat and so is a bank signatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7550)|
| 2:05:59| Board Member Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7559)|
| 2:06:00| I just want to thank you both for that clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7560)|
| 2:06:02| So with that said, I guess I can't make the change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7562)|
| 2:06:06| I wanted to make the change to say Knox County School, like a full employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7566)|
| 2:06:10| so you're saying that that would not be best practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7570)|
| 2:06:14| I know some moms who substitute maybe a couple days a month but serve on PTOs or PTAs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7574)|
| 2:06:19| and I'd hate to limit their abilities if they're just subbing a few days a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7579)|
| 2:06:23| Would that make sense to maybe change it to full-time employees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7583)|
| 2:06:28| They can still serve, and they can serve as an officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7588)|
| 2:06:33| Not as treasurer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7593)|
| 2:06:34| Just not as treasurer and not as a signatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7594)|
| 2:06:38| So where the signatory thing kind of gets a little hazy is that oftentimes presidents of SSOs are signatories,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7598)|
| 2:06:48| but there's nothing that says that the president has to be the signatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7608)|
| 2:06:54| Again, best practices are that you have two signatories, the treasurer obviously being one and then somebody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7614)|
| 2:07:02| So, again, presidents, if they are a signatory, should not be a school employee under this policy change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7622)|
| 2:07:10| But still, if that's the case, then a school employee could be a vice president, secretary, or serve in other capacities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7630)|
| 2:07:21| Board Member Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7641)|
| 2:07:23| Thank you, Madam Vice Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7643)|
| 2:07:24| As somebody who has an organization that gets audited every year as a matter of course| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7644)|
| 2:07:29| and has to deal with signatories and all these types of liability issues, I do agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7649)|
| 2:07:34| I think this is best practice, and I think it's simply protecting employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7654)|
| 2:07:38| although I know it's going to cause some frustration in some organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7658)|
| 2:07:42| It's going to create some things that they have to do and shift and change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7662)|
| 2:07:46| and I want to make sure that folks understand it's not indicative on the job that people are doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7666)|
| 2:07:50| or the performance or a claim that people have been acting inappropriately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7670)|
| 2:07:54| It's simply a matter of protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7674)|
| 2:07:59| If you wouldn't mind, just add one more thing, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7679)|
| 2:08:01| And also remember, too, if you allow wiggle room to loose in a best practice, then why have the best practice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7681)|
| 2:08:09| The procedures behind this are really what are the struggle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7689)|
| 2:08:14| So currently 225 SSOs that we're aware of in Knox County Schools, that's 225 treasurers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7694)|
| 2:08:22| 225. You see where I'm going with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7702)|
| 2:08:25| Like there's a lot, a lot of people, and when you're trying to do what we're trying to do in the finance department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7705)|
| 2:08:31| to negate that risk, that's 225 people that, yeah, I mean, I'm with Ms. Betsy, I'm with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7711)|
| 2:08:39| It's a stinky, excuse my language there, it's a stinky little area to be in that you don't want to ruin that for the substitute teacher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7719)|
| 2:08:46| that's just trying to help. Believe me, my heart's there for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7726)|
| 2:08:49| But I would just kind of flip the script, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7729)|
| 2:08:51| Like why? Why take that risk on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7731)|
| 2:08:54| Like enjoy being a substitute teacher, you know, and just try to protect you that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7734)|
| 2:09:00| So just be careful on the procedure side of what you're looking at here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7740)|
| 2:09:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7745)|
| 2:09:06| Board Member Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7746)|
| 2:09:07| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7747)|
| 2:09:09| My recollection is that when we were discussing this in policy review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7749)|
| 2:09:14| the weight of our conversation was around employees who are in the same school as the school support organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7754)|
| 2:09:21| But as it's written here, it's all employees, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7761)|
| 2:09:25| So they could, I want to be sure we all understand that this is saying that they also can't do that at a different school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7765)|
| 2:09:31| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7771)|
| 2:09:32| That's correct, Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7772)|
| 2:09:34| And, you know, again, that goes back to what Garrett Radin was talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7774)|
| 2:09:39| I mean, you know, with a district this large, I mean, we would really have to go to that measure for best practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7779)|
| 2:09:45| We have a lot of situations where we've got an employee of a certain school who is a coach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7785)|
| 2:09:50| or serves in some other capacity at another school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7790)|
| 2:09:56| Yeah, well, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7796)|
| 2:09:59| And, I mean, you see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7799)|
| 2:10:00| Yeah, you see employees who are parents as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7800)|
| 2:10:03| And, I mean, I think that's where a lot of this came from, employees as parents, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7803)|
| 2:10:07| wanting to serve on these boards, and we get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7807)|
| 2:10:10| Again, we're not saying you can't serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7810)|
| 2:10:12| Just take away that liability that you would have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7812)|
| 2:10:16| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7816)|
| 2:10:18| Who carried?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7818)|
| 2:10:19| Who was that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7819)|

| 2:10:48| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7848)|
| 2:10:49| I'm not quite sure where to put this little piece, but you all have a little half sheet at your seat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7849)|
| 2:10:55| and if you will mark out the second one, which is E-122, emergency preparedness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7855)|
| 2:11:01| But the others that are listed there in that section are all changes that are only changes due to a change in the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7861)|
| 2:11:10| So this isn't something that we have real decision to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7870)|
| 2:11:14| Those are only changes in the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7874)|
| 2:11:16| So I would propose that we waive second reading and go ahead and take care of those so that our staffs know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7876)|
| 2:11:27| and can go ahead and have those in their handbooks as they need them so that we won't have to do this again in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7887)|
| 2:11:34| And there's also a change that's non-substantial in J-152.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7894)|
| 2:11:39| So, Mr. Dupler, should I waive that second reading?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7899)|
| 2:11:43| Should I do that all at once when we finish?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7903)|
| 2:11:45| Is that the best way to do that or do it on each one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7905)|
| 2:11:51| I think the board can have a motion to waive second reading on all the policies that you have enumerated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7911)|
| 2:11:57| And then I would clarify that we're excluding E-122.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7917)|
| 2:12:01| We're asking that that just be first reading because I've heard from school security chief Perriard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7921)|
| 2:12:08| about possibly adding some language there for clarification based upon the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7928)|
| 2:12:13| So not significant changes, but, I mean, that's the only reason we would ask that that would not be included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7933)|
| 2:12:19| All right. Thank you, Mr. Dupler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7939)|
| 2:12:21| In that case, I would also make a motion at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7941)|
| 2:12:25| Can I maybe just amend the one I have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7945)|
| 2:12:28| So motion to approve E-120 safety and also to waive second reading for E-120, G-381, G-410, I-222,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7948)|
| 2:12:45| I-341, J-120, J-150, J-241, J-392, J-580, and J-152.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7965)|
| 2:13:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7985)|
| 2:13:07| New motion made by Board Member Owens, seconded by Board Member Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7987)|
| 2:13:13| We do have public forum for one of these items, but that's just waiving the second reading, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7993)|
| 2:13:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=7998)|
| 2:13:22| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=8002)|
| 2:13:24| Do I need to break that into two motions for 120 and for the waiver?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=8004)|
| 2:13:28| Is that easier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=8008)|
| 2:13:30| Okay. So take out that part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=8010)|
| 2:13:33| We're not approving 120 right now, just approving the waiver of the second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=8013)|
| 2:13:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=8017)|
| 2:13:38| You're still seconding it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=8018)|
| 2:13:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=8019)|

| 2:14:35| We can go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=8075)|
| 2:14:36| Well, I was going to make a substitute motion that we just hold it since we know there's going to be changes in it that Mr. Perriard is wanting to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=8076)|
| 2:14:44| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=8084)|
| 2:14:46| I would, I mean, I would ask the board just go ahead and do what you've done, is do the first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=8086)|
| 2:14:53| We could make the tweaks, I mean, for next month on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=8093)|
| 2:14:56| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=8096)|

| 2:16:52| Board Member Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=8212)|

| 2:16:58| Thank you, Madam Vice Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=8218)|
| 2:17:00| Because this affects every student in Knox County schools, can we just speak to this and the implications of it, Dr. Ryswick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=8220)|
| 2:17:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=8228)|
| 2:17:10| Thank you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=8230)|
| 2:17:12| I'll actually probably let Dr. Wilson speak to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=8232)|
| 2:17:14| It is a 6-12 change for that, so I'll let Dr. Wilson speak to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=8234)|
| 2:17:23| Well, just the, you know, I think it's a big deal to folks out there that our grading is changing universally 6-12,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=8243)|
| 2:17:30| so if you can just speak to what that is and how it impacts students and also the fact that it's not retroactive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=8250)|
| 2:17:36| Yeah, I think that's actually probably the biggest factor is for our school counselors and grading managers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=8256)|
| 2:17:42| who will be living in two different systems for a little while as students move through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=8262)|
| 2:17:46| especially at the high school when we're looking at GPAs for transcripts and all that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=8266)|
| 2:17:51| I know that both Stanley and the team that work on Aspen and work with the grading managers at the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=8271)|
| 2:17:59| have already been setting up systems and ensuring that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=8279)|
| 2:18:02| things are set up to where the new grading system will be intact, ready to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=8282)|
| 2:18:07| and will not be something that the counselors or teachers have to go in and select.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=8287)|
| 2:18:11| It will already be automatic for the current school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=8291)|
| 2:18:14| And then, again, from the grade calculation standpoint at the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=8294)|
| 2:18:18| that's going to be a piece they're going to have to be pretty careful about for the next little while| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=8298)|
| 2:18:22| in terms of ensuring they're using both those systems as students move through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=8302)|
| 2:18:26| and communicating, I'm sure, with parents about the change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=8306)|
| 2:18:29| and how that's going to look different and impact the GPA for the upcoming year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=8309)|
| 2:18:33| Right. And the biggest change that we're talking about is now it's a 10-point scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=8313)|
| 2:18:37| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=8317)|
| 2:18:38| And A's 10 points, you know, 91 and up and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=8318)|
| 2:18:41| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=8321)|

| 2:27:10| Is this a continuation of what we currently do, or is this a different RTI tool?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=8830)|
| 2:27:17| I believe it is, but Shannon, if that's incorrect, you're welcome to come up and correct that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=8837)|

| 2:28:27| Thank you, Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=8907)|
| 2:28:28| So, this one has a bit of a history, and as you can see, the original contract was approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=8908)|
| 2:28:33| October of 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=8913)|
| 2:28:35| What happened was that as soon as we had this 1,400-page contract in place, Cambridge wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=8915)|
| 2:28:43| some other documents signed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=8923)|
| 2:28:45| So, things shut down for a while, and then COVID happened as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=8925)|
| 2:28:52| So, I have, and then Cambridge secured some new attorneys, and they've been good to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=8932)|
| 2:28:59| with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=8939)|
| 2:29:00| And so, we came up with some new pages that they wanted added to the contract, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=8940)|
| 2:29:08| amendments and things, but things that we could also live with as a school district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=8948)|
| 2:29:13| because, obviously, we wanted to provide this as a benefit to students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=8953)|
| 2:29:19| So, unfortunately, it's taken this long, but, I mean, at this point, yes, I have been able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=8959)|
| 2:29:26| to approve the amended documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=8966)|

| 2:30:30| Can somebody speak to the differentiated pay plan and any major adjustments made to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9030)|
| 2:30:34| plan this year from last year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9034)|
| 2:30:37| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9037)|
| 2:30:41| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9041)|
| 2:30:42| Madam Vice Chair, members of the Board, Board Member Watson, you're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9042)|
| 2:30:46| The differentiated pay plan is something that we are required to have and submit to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9046)|
| 2:30:50| state each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9050)|
| 2:30:51| It highlights additional compensation that any category of educators or employees may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9051)|
| 2:30:57| receive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9057)|
| 2:30:58| So you'll see some things you've heard about and approved before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9058)|
| 2:31:01| So our stipends for special education teachers, tuition assistance, all of these items are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9061)|
| 2:31:07| individually approved within the budget as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9067)|
| 2:31:11| There is one difference from last year to this year, and that is on, I think it's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9071)|
| 2:31:16| second page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9076)|
| 2:31:17| It is a salary supplement for teachers and educational assistants at Fort Sanders, Ridgedale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9077)|
| 2:31:22| Richard Yokely, and KAC, and that was also included in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9082)|
| 2:31:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9087)|
| 2:31:28| As somebody who represents Ridgedale, I know this is something they've been looking for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9088)|

| 2:31:35| I really appreciate the district taking this opportunity because if you're familiar with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9095)|
| 2:31:41| those schools and the unbelievable work that they do there to come around to our young| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9101)|
| 2:31:45| people, I know Mr. Myers is, it means a lot to them to be able to have this additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9105)|

| 2:32:40| Thank you, Madam Vice Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9160)|
| 2:32:41| I'm assuming that most of these changes, we just had some conversation not many months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9161)|
| 2:32:45| ago where we talked about how Knox County Schools has not historically been in the playground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9165)|
| 2:32:49| business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9169)|

| 2:32:55| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9175)|
| 2:32:56| I mean, they're being funded by it, but I just want to make sure that's what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9176)|
| 2:33:00| Thank you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9180)|
| 2:33:01| Yes, we're funding it using IDEA preschool funds and then rollover funds from the regular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9181)|
| 2:33:06| IDEA budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9186)|
| 2:33:08| This is really, as we expand our preschool programming availability, we need to be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9188)|
| 2:33:12| to upgrade and provide age-appropriate equipment to the elementary schools that are going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9192)|
| 2:33:16| house some of those programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9196)|
| 2:33:18| And then with the Fort, obviously, there are preschool facilities, so we're just trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9198)|
| 2:33:22| to improve upon existing facility there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9202)|

| 2:33:31| that Mr. Thomas and Mr. Oaks both had done some work around design standards for playgrounds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9211)|
| 2:33:37| as we started having a conversation about the possibility of being more supportive of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9217)|
| 2:33:41| our schools and the community as we continue to build schools and look at upgrades to playgrounds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9221)|
| 2:33:47| over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9227)|

| 2:34:46| I can't tell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9286)|
| 2:34:47| I just wanted to thank Ms. Kelly for bringing this as a possibility for honoring Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9287)|
| 2:34:54| And I think it's a completely appropriate use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9294)|
| 2:34:56| We know how welcoming he has been over his whole career and also certainly tried to implement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9296)|
| 2:35:02| many strategies to be more welcoming to our newcomers and our ESL students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9302)|
| 2:35:08| So I think this is a great way to honor him and his legacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9308)|
| 2:35:11| And again, thank you to Ms. Kelly for bringing this as a possibility to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9311)|

| 2:35:33| Good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9333)|
| 2:35:34| Okay, awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9334)|
| 2:35:35| Timothy Buss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9335)|
| 2:35:38| Hi, Timothy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9338)|
| 2:35:39| You have three minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9339)|
| 2:35:40| If you could state your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9340)|
| 2:35:43| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9343)|
| 2:35:44| My name is Tim Buss, and I've been a resident of Knox County for 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9344)|
| 2:35:49| And sorry I'm a little underdressed, but I had to get in a mental health swim tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9349)|
| 2:35:54| before coming to the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9354)|
| 2:35:57| I'd like to start by thanking you guys for letting me speak tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9357)|
| 2:36:00| I'd like to congratulate Dr. Reiswick on his new position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9360)|
| 2:36:04| And I also would like to say my thanks, although he's not here, to Superintendent Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9364)|
| 2:36:11| I met him several years ago, and he was very kind, and I felt like he really listened to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9371)|
| 2:36:18| and tried to understand me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9378)|
| 2:36:20| And then finally, I'd like to let you guys know that everyone I've ever interacted with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9380)|
| 2:36:25| in the Knox County schools I feel like has shown a genuine regard for me and my family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9385)|
| 2:36:30| and has done everything within their power, within the constraints of the system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9390)|
| 2:36:34| and their own personal efforts to help us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9394)|
| 2:36:36| I think that's worth noting. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9396)|
| 2:36:39| I'm here to speak tonight about the Disparities Report that was presented last October or November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9399)|
| 2:36:49| I'm a single parent of a rising junior at Fulton. Her name's Maria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9409)|
| 2:36:54| I'm also responsible for her six-year-old half-sister, Natalia, since September of 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9414)|
| 2:37:02| Maria has had an IEP since she was in the second grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9422)|
| 2:37:07| She's a socially normal teen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9427)|
| 2:37:11| She doesn't have intellectual disabilities, but she has some pretty severe learning disabilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9431)|
| 2:37:15| in reading and math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9435)|
| 2:37:17| She shows characteristics of dyslexia and dyscalculia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9437)|
| 2:37:22| And I'm glad I can finally say those words in a Knox County school session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9442)|
| 2:37:28| Because of Maria's issues, I became a member of the Special Education Parent Advisory Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9448)|
| 2:37:33| about five years ago. I worked with Sue Owenby on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9453)|
| 2:37:36| And I was recently asked and joined the AE Support Services Team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9456)|
| 2:37:44| When I saw the DEO report, I was at Central in the library when that was presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9464)|
| 2:37:49| And despite my own personal experience with the schools and the results that Maria has had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9469)|
| 2:37:58| I mean, I was shocked. I mean, I was really shocked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9478)|
| 2:38:01| I was really shocked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9481)|
| 2:38:03| Maria, despite my heavy involvement in her team since second grade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9483)|
| 2:38:07| her Aimsweb scores still put her in fourth and fifth grade at her instructional level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9487)|
| 2:38:15| I met with Ms. Owen yesterday, and she gave me a lot of good background| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9495)|
| 2:38:20| and some of her own personal experience that helped kind of temper my,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9500)|
| 2:38:25| I don't want to say my emotions, but my views.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9505)|
| 2:38:28| I'm still processing that information and putting it together with my own thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9508)|
| 2:38:33| So I'm not going to speak any further tonight other than just to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9513)|
| 2:38:37| I would urge the board not to let the work of the AE get put on the shelf or get lost in the transmission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9517)|
| 2:38:45| And the region's plan, I think, has some promise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9525)|
| 2:38:49| I'm curious to hear more about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9529)|
| 2:38:51| And I plan to return in September when the new board is in place and present a more informed view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9531)|
| 2:38:56| Thank you, Mr. Buss. I appreciate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9536)|
| 2:38:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9538)|
| 2:39:00| Next, we have Kaitlyn Jones. Kaitlyn Jones, state your name, county of residence, and you have three minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9540)|
| 2:39:09| Hi, my name is Kaitlyn Jones. I live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9549)|
| 2:39:11| At the end of the regular school year, I met with the IEP team to discuss the extended school year program for Alec.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9551)|
| 2:39:17| During this meeting, I was told that Alec would be attending extended school year two days a week for two hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9557)|
| 2:39:22| I asked why the program was only offered two days a week and said that he needed more time than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9562)|
| 2:39:27| They agreed to move him to three days a week and said that was the only other session Knox County offered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9567)|
| 2:39:32| I agreed as I was under the impression that was the only option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9572)|
| 2:39:35| Fast forward a few weeks and imagine my surprise when I found out Alec was leaving early and only going part time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9575)|
| 2:39:41| Turns out ESYs offered a full week in normal school hours, even though I was told otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9581)|
| 2:39:46| When I set up an IEP with the ESY school, they said they could not legally change the original IEP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9586)|
| 2:39:51| team's decision. When I asked to be shown what law they were referencing, they could not even find it to tell me or send it to me days later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9591)|
| 2:39:59| Both the original IEP team and the ESY IEP team referenced their decision on data they were claiming to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9599)|
| 2:40:06| When I asked to see the data, they did not have any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9606)|
| 2:40:09| Both IEP teams could not actually tell me what data they were using to make these decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9609)|
| 2:40:13| After pushing for an answer, I was finally told that the data they used to make the decisions was the IEP itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9613)|
| 2:40:18| However, the IEP I have always received had zero data in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9618)|
| 2:40:23| When I asked for more specifics, no one could give me any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9623)|
| 2:40:26| If you think I said data a lot in the last minute, imagine how you would feel as a parent and that being the only answer you get for every question and concern you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9626)|
| 2:40:33| Ultimately, I was told that I should have asked the original team for Alec to go to ESY full time, but I did and I was told that that was not possible and was not an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9633)|
| 2:40:41| How am I or any other parent supposed to know every single program Knox County offers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9641)|
| 2:40:45| How am I supposed to know the rules, guidelines, policies for everything that happens in the Knox County school system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9645)|
| 2:40:51| As a parent, I would expect for the IEP team and the teachers to do what is best for Alec and other children and not just do the bare minimum by state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9651)|
| 2:40:59| Unfortunately, over the last year, I've had several, at least 25 families reach out to me with these exact frustrations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9659)|
| 2:41:05| An ongoing theme is the feeling of defeat because schools in every district are not doing what's best for the students, but instead they are doing as little as they can legally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220713?start=9665)|
