| 0:01:51| part of working together with other entities of the government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=111)|

| 0:02:06| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=126)|
| 0:02:07| The process will be, as commissioners, as always,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=127)|
| 0:02:12| we're going to let the candidates probably have about three minutes to address this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=132)|
| 0:02:18| and then we will ask questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=138)|

| 0:02:24| This morning at the finance committee meeting, I was asked if I would ask two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=144)|
| 0:02:41| And they are posted on the commission form for Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=161)|
| 0:02:46| I would like to read those two questions so that all of the candidates can insert their response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=166)|
| 0:02:52| for those two questions in their presentations, if that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=172)|
| 0:02:57| That's Councilman Mark Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=177)|
| 0:02:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=178)|
| 0:03:01| Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=181)|
| 0:03:03| Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=183)|
| 0:03:04| Ivan Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=184)|
| 0:03:06| Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=186)|
| 0:03:07| Commissioner Mark Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=187)|
| 0:03:09| You can ask your own questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=189)|
| 0:03:12| Have a good time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=192)|
| 0:03:13| I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=193)|
| 0:03:14| No, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=194)|
| 0:03:16| The two questions that are posted on the commission form are, question number one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=196)|
| 0:03:22| what district or part of Knox County district, other than the 8th district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=202)|
| 0:03:30| do you believe could be getting shortchanged in the allocation of educational resources?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=210)|
| 0:03:42| And the second question is, name a specific policy, procedure, decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=222)|
| 0:03:48| or action of the school board that you think should be reconsidered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=228)|
| 0:03:57| What?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=237)|
| 0:03:58| Could you repeat that, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=238)|
| 0:04:00| I most certainly would be happy to repeat both of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=240)|
| 0:04:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=242)|
| 0:04:03| The first question is, what district or part of Knox County, other than the 8th district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=243)|
| 0:04:12| do you believe could be getting shortchanged in the allocation of educational resources?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=252)|
| 0:04:21| The second question is, name a specific policy, procedure, decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=261)|
| 0:04:30| or action of the school board that you think should be reconsidered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=270)|
| 0:04:36| And as I've stated previously, these are two questions that are posted on the commission form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=276)|
| 0:04:43| and are being asked by Knox County Commissioner Mark Harmon in his absence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=283)|
| 0:04:51| because he is in the classroom right now at the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=291)|
| 0:04:56| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=296)|
| 0:04:58| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=298)|
| 0:05:01| I'd like to let the public and the audience know that people on CTV that are watching,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=301)|
| 0:05:08| that all these candidates did send in resumes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=308)|
| 0:05:11| so all the commissioners have their resumes and they have studied them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=311)|
| 0:05:16| So we're getting ready to start the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=316)|
| 0:05:20| I'm going to ask the Vice Chair to pick out the first one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=320)|
| 0:05:26| We have all eight names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=326)|
| 0:05:29| Who will go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=329)|
| 0:05:36| Carrie Perkinson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=336)|
| 0:05:42| You can thank me later for drawing you first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=342)|
| 0:05:49| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=349)|
| 0:05:50| Like you said, my name is Carrie Perkinson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=350)|
| 0:05:53| I am very passionate about education and what's going on in our school systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=353)|
| 0:05:59| I am a parent of two children in the Knox County school systems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=359)|
| 0:06:03| so I'm very interested in what's going on and what will affect them in their future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=363)|
| 0:06:08| I am a contributing citizen to society,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=368)|
| 0:06:12| so I, of course, want all children to be well-educated as they are future leaders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=372)|
| 0:06:18| And one day we'll be making decisions that will affect me as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=378)|
| 0:06:22| I am also an educator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=382)|
| 0:06:25| I am currently a teacher, and so because of that, I just found out that I am not eligible for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=385)|
| 0:06:31| I see you shaking your head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=391)|
| 0:06:33| So I do apologize for wasting your time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=393)|
| 0:06:36| and I thank you for letting me have the opportunity to come and put my name in for school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=396)|
| 0:06:42| So maybe next time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=402)|
| 0:06:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=403)|
| 0:06:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=405)|
| 0:06:51| I wish you didn't have to wait around through eight or nine names to tell us that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=411)|
| 0:06:56| She should thank you then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=416)|
| 0:06:57| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=417)|

| 0:07:01| The next one will be Matt Cannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=421)|
| 0:07:10| Matt Cannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=430)|
| 0:07:21| Matt Cannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=441)|
| 0:07:28| Two for two is two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=448)|
| 0:07:31| We'll get right through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=451)|
| 0:07:35| Jessica Ballou.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=455)|
| 0:07:39| Jessica Ballou.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=459)|
| 0:07:48| Why don't you try one, Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=468)|
| 0:07:53| At least my first one was here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=473)|
| 0:07:56| The county commission would go like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=476)|
| 0:08:01| Never.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=481)|
| 0:08:04| Well, I'll see this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=484)|
| 0:08:05| Deborah Porter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=485)|
| 0:08:15| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=495)|
| 0:08:17| I have a couple of things that I probably need to pass up to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=497)|
| 0:08:21| maybe in addition to my resume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=501)|
| 0:08:40| I'm Deborah Porter, and I reside at 4412 Walden Pond Lane in Corrington, 37721.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=520)|
| 0:08:51| Basically, to get started, I'd just like to say that the school board has been a passion in my heart for a very long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=531)|
| 0:09:03| I attempted to run for office in 1992, preparing for the 1994 election for the first district, and that's been, gosh, 20 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=543)|
| 0:09:15| So 20 years has come and gone, and I find myself at this point again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=555)|
| 0:09:21| not knowing that I would be living in the eighth district, which I've lived there for three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=561)|
| 0:09:28| and really finding myself in this position and thinking that I'm in a good position to be able to stand here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=568)|
| 0:09:41| and talk to you a little bit about what I believe in, in terms of the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=581)|
| 0:09:47| And not only the school board, what I believe in in terms of children and their education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=587)|
| 0:09:53| I am passionate about the education of our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=593)|
| 0:09:57| I was raised, I am a Knoxvillian, and went to public schools, and you'll see that on that additional sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=597)|
| 0:10:06| I attended Canceler Elementary, Sammy Hill Elementary, Beardsley Junior High School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=606)|
| 0:10:12| and I graduated from Austin East in 1970, and then graduated from the University of Tennessee here in Knoxville in 1974.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=612)|
| 0:10:20| So, yes, I'm an old person, if you're trying to count those years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=620)|
| 0:10:26| I'm not a spring chicken anymore, not a spring chicken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=626)|
| 0:10:31| But I would like to just say that in my desire to see children become successful in the best that they can be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=631)|
| 0:10:41| I believe that they have to have a great, not a good, a great education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=641)|
| 0:10:47| And I believe our Knox County school system can give our children a great education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=647)|
| 0:10:55| I have volunteered many years in different venues for the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=655)|
| 0:11:03| As you can see there, and I'm going to read just a little bit of it so that you won't have to sit there and read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=663)|
| 0:11:10| But my most recent volunteer activities, Knox Achieves Mentor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=670)|
| 0:11:15| The program started last year, and I have been a mentor for two years at Austin East and Fulton High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=675)|
| 0:11:22| The Read With Me program, again, two years at Bell Morris and Sarah Moore Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=682)|
| 0:11:30| Beaumont Magnet School Fundraisers helped with the magnet school in terms of them raising money for their science program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=690)|
| 0:11:38| and that was 2008 to 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=698)|
| 0:11:41| Advisory Board Chair for the Business and Finance Academy at Austin East,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=701)|
| 0:11:45| and that started way back with the Empowerment Zone in 2000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=705)|
| 0:11:50| Well, the Empowerment Zone started in 1999, but with Austin East back in 2006 when I started that process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=710)|
| 0:11:58| and I served as the Advisory Board Chair for Austin East Business and Finance Academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=718)|
| 0:12:04| Also, I've been serving as the Advisory Board Member of the National Achievers Society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=724)|
| 0:12:11| That's with the Knoxville Area Urban League.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=731)|
| 0:12:13| I attend the Great Schools Partnerships meetings at the chamber,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=733)|
| 0:12:18| and sometimes I'm actually sitting in for the mayor on those meetings with the Great Schools Partnerships,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=738)|
| 0:12:27| learn quite a bit there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=747)|
| 0:12:29| And I've prepared etiquette workshops and given those workshops at area high schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=749)|
| 0:12:35| I attend most of the school forums and PTA meetings at Austin East and Fulton High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=755)|
| 0:12:41| I think one of the questions was, what district do you think is being maybe shortchanged in terms of monetary money or money for that district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=761)|
| 0:12:57| I'm really in thinking about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=777)|
| 0:13:00| At first, I thought, well, maybe not any district, but as I think back, I'm thinking about District 2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=780)|
| 0:13:09| and some of the needs there in District 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=789)|
| 0:13:13| At one point, I lived in North Hills and lived in the second district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=793)|
| 0:13:18| and I really believe that there are a lot of things that could happen in that school district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=798)|
| 0:13:25| Also, as I continue in this vein in terms of the question asked, the school board policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=805)|
| 0:13:32| I would like to see maybe the security policy changed given the things that happened last week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=812)|
| 0:13:39| and some of the things that are going on just in terms of the security and what's happening with our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=819)|
| 0:13:47| Not only them, you want to make sure that they're in a safe environment and zero tolerance is fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=827)|
| 0:13:54| When it comes to the children or the students being under that policy, but what about zero tolerance for adults as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=834)|
| 0:14:03| So we may need to look at that security policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=843)|
| 0:14:08| Basically, my heart and my passion is to serve the community, serve the 8th District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=848)|
| 0:14:15| be an advocate for the children and for the parents in the 8th District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=855)|
| 0:14:21| but most importantly, to be on a team that believes that there should be a great education given to all children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=861)|
| 0:14:32| no matter what district they live in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=872)|
| 0:14:35| So basically, if you say, well, Debra, do you have a platform?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=875)|
| 0:14:39| Platform is a great education for all children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=879)|
| 0:14:45| Are there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=885)|
| 0:14:49| Ms. Kincannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=889)|
| 0:14:52| Thank you, Chairman Strickland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=892)|
| 0:14:53| I first want to just thank the Commission and you personally for inviting school board members to participate in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=893)|
| 0:14:59| I appreciate the opportunity and the partnership and collaboration to work together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=899)|
| 0:15:05| I have two questions that I wanted to ask all the candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=905)|
| 0:15:08| First, Ms. Porter, nice to see you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=908)|
| 0:15:11| The first question is, how do you see the role of a school board member?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=911)|
| 0:15:15| What is your vision of how school board members should be involved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=915)|
| 0:15:19| And the second is just how you would define a successful education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=919)|
| 0:15:25| Well, let's start with a successful education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=925)|
| 0:15:29| As I said earlier, I believe that each student should be able to have a great education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=929)|
| 0:15:37| And unfortunately, in my mind, we have to start with money a lot of times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=937)|
| 0:15:43| Do we want to spend $5,000, $6,000, $7,000 on each student at this level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=943)|
| 0:15:51| or do we want to look at sometimes when children do not get a good education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=951)|
| 0:15:57| they end up in trouble, end up in jail, end up in prison, and we're spending $30,000, $40,000, $50,000 at the other end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=957)|
| 0:16:05| I would suggest that we want to spend at least $5,000, $6,000, $7,000, $8,000 on each child at the very beginning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=965)|
| 0:16:14| rather than that amount at the end when they have not gotten a great education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=974)|
| 0:16:20| and end up in trouble and end up in jail or prison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=980)|
| 0:16:24| In terms of my role as a school board member, I believe in being a partner, a tag team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=984)|
| 0:16:34| and that's serving with the other eight members of the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=994)|
| 0:16:40| And I guess a strong point of mine would be the budget and the finance area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1000)|
| 0:16:47| which I think is something that is very important for the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1007)|
| 0:16:52| In one of my lives, I was the executive director of the Mechanicsville Community Development Corporation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1012)|
| 0:16:58| and had to raise the money first, and then over a four-year period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1018)|
| 0:17:03| we raised over $500,000 for the Community Development Corporation in Mechanicsville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1023)|
| 0:17:10| and we actually administered those funds as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1030)|
| 0:17:13| So I think that's one of the points that is near and dear to my heart as well as that education for our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1033)|
| 0:17:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1042)|
| 0:17:23| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1043)|
| 0:17:24| Thank you, Ms. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1044)|
| 0:17:25| Ms. Porter, thank you for your interest, by the way, in coming down and submitting your resume| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1045)|
| 0:17:29| and submitting yourself for this seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1049)|
| 0:17:32| Do you see yourself as a caretaker in this position, or do you plan on running for this seat?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1052)|
| 0:17:37| I really see myself as a caretaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1057)|
| 0:17:40| I will not be able to run due to certain circumstances and committing those four years right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1060)|
| 0:17:47| I'd like to look at it maybe a little bit later on, but definitely a caretaker of the position right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1067)|
| 0:17:53| You are presently the manager of the Office of Neighborhoods and Community Services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1073)|
| 0:17:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1076)|
| 0:17:57| Do you see any type of conflict at all working in the mayor's office and being on the school board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1077)|
| 0:18:02| I do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1082)|
| 0:18:03| I do not handle any budget or anything in the mayor's office or with the payroll budgeting process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1083)|
| 0:18:13| so therefore I don't see a conflict at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1093)|
| 0:18:17| I come from a family of educators, wives, daughters, sisters-in-law, et cetera, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1097)|
| 0:18:23| And when you talk about education, it's usually focused at the teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1103)|
| 0:18:28| What more can we ask the teacher to do with regards to scores, et cetera, et cetera?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1108)|
| 0:18:35| It seems to me that there's one area that we should focus on, and I don't know how to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1115)|
| 0:18:40| That's why I'm asking you, and that is parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1120)|
| 0:18:43| When the child goes home, the learning shouldn't stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1123)|
| 0:18:48| And when I go to PTA meetings, I'm always amazed that some schools have very active PTAs and some don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1128)|
| 0:18:55| Do you have any ideas on how we might be able to mobilize parents to get them more involved in the schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1135)|
| 0:19:02| and more involved in their children's education?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1142)|
| 0:19:06| Thank you for that question, Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1146)|
| 0:19:09| Actually, as I think back, I think parent involvement was definitely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1149)|
| 0:19:15| and is definitely one of my keys to education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1155)|
| 0:19:21| Just the other week, my great-niece, who attends Bell Morris Elementary, came home with a lot of fractions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1161)|
| 0:19:29| She's in the fourth grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1169)|
| 0:19:31| And, of course, her mommy couldn't help her a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1171)|
| 0:19:36| But here again, her great-aunt has to reach way back, fifth grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1176)|
| 0:19:43| I think we had it in fifth grade, and try to help her with fractions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1183)|
| 0:19:48| I believe that in order to get our parents involved, it's going to take, at a very early age,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1188)|
| 0:19:57| the time they enter kindergarten to really hone them in on understanding the importance of being active in their child's lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1197)|
| 0:20:08| You know, a lot of times they're there for the sports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1208)|
| 0:20:10| They're there, you know, to cheer them on when they're cheerleading or with the football, basketball, any type of sports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1210)|
| 0:20:19| But when it really comes to the education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1219)|
| 0:20:23| and sometimes it may be that they're a little bit intimidated by the things that are going on in the schools now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1223)|
| 0:20:30| but I really believe if we just get the parents to a point of understanding how important it is to be a part of the child's life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1230)|
| 0:20:39| And, again, that comes at a very early age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1239)|
| 0:20:42| It doesn't come when they're in middle school, and then Lord knows it won't happen in high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1242)|
| 0:20:48| So it has to start very early, preschool for that matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1248)|
| 0:20:52| And I believe if we could show them how important it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1252)|
| 0:20:56| And sometimes, you know, people are just trying to make a living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1256)|
| 0:21:01| They want to be involved in their child's life, but they have so many other things going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1261)|
| 0:21:06| They're just trying to keep things together in their family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1266)|
| 0:21:10| So it's not that a lot of times they may not want to be involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1270)|
| 0:21:14| It's that sometimes they can't be involved with things that are happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1274)|
| 0:21:18| But I think if we can get that message to them, how important it is for parent involvement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1278)|
| 0:21:23| I think that we'll get more parents involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1283)|
| 0:21:26| I attend PTA meetings, and I don't have any children in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1286)|
| 0:21:30| I have a great niece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1290)|
| 0:21:32| I have a step-grandchild that is at New Hopewell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1292)|
| 0:21:38| So I have a family that is attending, but that's why I attend the PTA meetings, to find out what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1298)|
| 0:21:48| Can I help a child?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1308)|
| 0:21:50| You know, I have been an advocate for children in the public school system for years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1310)|
| 0:21:57| back when Beardsley was still standing, Whittlesprings, Central, South Doyle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1317)|
| 0:22:05| You name the school, I've probably been there advocating for our children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1325)|
| 0:22:09| and standing in on the behalf of the parent a lot of times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1329)|
| 0:22:14| Commissioner Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1334)|
| 0:22:15| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1335)|
| 0:22:17| And thank you, Ms. Porter, for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1337)|
| 0:22:19| I appreciate your responses, and actually some of what you've talked about briefly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1339)|
| 0:22:24| addresses some of the questions I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1344)|
| 0:22:27| You know, here we are in an era of pretty restricted resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1347)|
| 0:22:32| And that affects education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1352)|
| 0:22:34| It affects everything we do in government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1354)|
| 0:22:37| It affects everything business does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1357)|
| 0:22:41| There may have been a really good example of thinking differently in the paper this morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1361)|
| 0:22:46| regarding the Hardin Valley Academy and a teacher who turned down the use of some new textbooks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1366)|
| 0:22:54| to get some microscopes or something to help in her class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1374)|
| 0:22:59| How can you as a school board member and the school board generally help think a little differently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1379)|
| 0:23:05| and maybe more efficiently to deliver a better product, i.e., a good education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1385)|
| 0:23:13| at either the current cost or maybe less?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1393)|
| 0:23:19| That will take a lot of creativity, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1399)|
| 0:23:24| I'm afraid we're going to have to do it in all the departments here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1404)|
| 0:23:27| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1407)|
| 0:23:29| You know, I think back, and, of course, I was in elementary school 50 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1409)|
| 0:23:37| But, you know, it seems like our teachers were so creative with what they had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1417)|
| 0:23:43| We didn't have a lot, but that they could do, you know, they brought in some resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1423)|
| 0:23:49| And I know it's kind of hard for teachers today because they probably do it quite a bit now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1429)|
| 0:23:55| probably more so now than when I was coming through school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1435)|
| 0:23:59| But I just believe that with the resources that we have, we have to make the best use of our resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1439)|
| 0:24:08| whether it's – and I really hate to put a burden on parents a lot of times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1448)|
| 0:24:14| because a lot of times parents don't have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1454)|
| 0:24:17| If they have it, then I know they will give it for their child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1457)|
| 0:24:23| And I once said, and I'm still of this belief that I will pay higher taxes for a great education for our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1463)|
| 0:24:31| And I know we frown upon that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1471)|
| 0:24:33| We don't want, you know, taxes to be, you know, raised by any means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1473)|
| 0:24:38| But sometimes thinking out of the box means that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1478)|
| 0:24:43| we have to look at some of those things that worked before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1483)|
| 0:24:46| And if it means that we have to do that, then, you know, I for one will raise my hand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1486)|
| 0:24:52| and I probably will get a whole lot of naysayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1492)|
| 0:24:56| But that's creative as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1496)|
| 0:24:59| But we have to make the best use of the resources that we have and not waste in any way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1499)|
| 0:25:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1505)|
| 0:25:06| Commissioner Armstrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1506)|
| 0:25:08| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1508)|
| 0:25:10| Thank you, Ms. Porter, for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1510)|
| 0:25:12| I appreciate you coming and stepping forward to apply for this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1512)|
| 0:25:17| I've heard the term great education many times even from the conversation and from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1517)|
| 0:25:28| To you, what is a great education and how would you measure it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1528)|
| 0:25:34| Well, I think a great education goes beyond what we may be doing now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1534)|
| 0:25:41| I know a lot of times we take assessments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1541)|
| 0:25:43| We have tests given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1543)|
| 0:25:46| And somewhere or another we shake out near the bottom a lot of times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1546)|
| 0:25:52| And I want, you know, Knox County schools to be up there in the high percentile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1552)|
| 0:26:01| I know in terms of Tennessee we may be low on the totem pole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1561)|
| 0:26:05| but in the east Tennessee in Knox County I think that we can be a little bit higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1565)|
| 0:26:12| And to me, I'm not always for assessing and a test,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1572)|
| 0:26:18| but a lot of times in order to measure you have to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1578)|
| 0:26:22| So where do we stand and how can we get our children to have a great education?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1582)|
| 0:26:28| It's by giving them everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1588)|
| 0:26:31| Believe it or not, I wanted to be a teacher at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1591)|
| 0:26:34| Of course, my path took a little bit of a different turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1594)|
| 0:26:38| And so as I look back on what I wanted to do as a teacher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1598)|
| 0:26:43| I wanted to give everything that I possibly could give to those students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1603)|
| 0:26:48| And, yes, it really takes a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1608)|
| 0:26:50| And not to say that our teachers aren't doing that these days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1610)|
| 0:26:54| but I think that we have to really give as much as we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1614)|
| 0:26:59| to make sure that our children get a great education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1619)|
| 0:27:06| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1626)|
| 0:27:11| Hi, Mr. Porter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1631)|
| 0:27:12| I have to say we really miss you in the second district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1632)|
| 0:27:16| But I'm glad to see that you want to be very involved in District 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1636)|
| 0:27:21| And I know that you have been very involved in the inner city schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1641)|
| 0:27:26| and you're very knowledgeable about them and about their needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1646)|
| 0:27:30| And I want you to explain how you see, to contrast,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1650)|
| 0:27:40| to compare between the more rural schools and the outlying districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1660)|
| 0:27:46| and the inner city schools, which you're so familiar with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1666)|
| 0:27:50| Well, Commissioner Burroughs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1670)|
| 0:27:52| I really don't see a whole lot of difference in terms of the needs of the students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1672)|
| 0:27:59| whether they're in urban or rural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1679)|
| 0:28:01| The needs remain the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1681)|
| 0:28:04| A great education for every child, no matter if they're in the urban center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1684)|
| 0:28:10| or if they're in the rural center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1690)|
| 0:28:12| It's just so happened that my experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1692)|
| 0:28:14| because I've lived most of my life in the urban center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1694)|
| 0:28:18| has been with the old city schools, as we used to say, but the urban center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1698)|
| 0:28:28| And there's really not any difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1708)|
| 0:28:30| The needs are the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1710)|
| 0:28:31| Parents need to be involved in their child's lives in the urban, just like rural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1711)|
| 0:28:38| We need to look at what's going on in the rural schools, just like in the urban.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1718)|
| 0:28:45| There are problems that exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1725)|
| 0:28:48| We have to address those problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1728)|
| 0:28:51| The needs are the same, and I'm sure the wants are the same as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1731)|
| 0:28:58| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1738)|
| 0:29:00| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1740)|
| 0:29:02| Ms. Porter, there's kind of a constant conversation going on as we look at this funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1742)|
| 0:29:08| limited resources, about where those funds should go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1748)|
| 0:29:12| And by that I mean classroom, teacher, teacher's assistance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1752)|
| 0:29:16| versus the central office and the administration and the supervision piece of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1756)|
| 0:29:22| What are your views on how a system like Knox County should handle those two entities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1762)|
| 0:29:30| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1770)|
| 0:29:31| You know, I really have to speak from my heart on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1771)|
| 0:29:34| because I believe teachers should be paid well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1774)|
| 0:29:38| You know, they spend a lot of time with our children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1778)|
| 0:29:43| and pretty much if you think about the time that is spent with a child from preschool all the way up to 12th grade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1783)|
| 0:29:51| how much time teachers spend with our children, I really believe teachers should be paid well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1791)|
| 0:29:58| Now, you ask me, are they paid well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1798)|
| 0:30:03| In my mind, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1803)|
| 0:30:05| And with the limited resources that we have, and that's usually a common, you know, thing we always think about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1805)|
| 0:30:12| you know, we don't have, we don't have, we don't have in terms of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1812)|
| 0:30:16| But I believe that there should be a balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1816)|
| 0:30:21| You know, the administrators, they should be paid as well and should be paid good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1821)|
| 0:30:27| But we don't want it to be an uneven playing field, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1827)|
| 0:30:33| A lot of times teachers have to go back to school, get their masters, some get their doctorates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1833)|
| 0:30:39| and teach in our school system and still aren't paid what I feel, like I said, I have to speak from my heart on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1839)|
| 0:30:49| what I feel that they should be paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1849)|
| 0:30:51| And it's really unfortunate that we lose a lot of our good teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1851)|
| 0:30:57| and great teachers going to other systems out of state because we cannot pay the salaries that they deserve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1857)|
| 0:31:06| or that I feel they deserve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1866)|
| 0:31:09| And that's unfortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1869)|
| 0:31:12| Not to say that the administration, if you have a $100,000 salary administration position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1872)|
| 0:31:21| and we look at a teacher's salary roughly $35,000, $40,000 a year, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1881)|
| 0:31:28| when you look at that and weigh that, is there a balance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1888)|
| 0:31:34| Sometimes you really have to think about the old saying, you know, you get what you pay for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1894)|
| 0:31:41| I would think not because teaching is a calling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1901)|
| 0:31:45| You have to love what you do because you're not being paid for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1905)|
| 0:31:52| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1912)|
| 0:31:55| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1915)|
| 0:31:58| Deborah, a question for you is you're in the 8th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1918)|
| 0:32:02| You've got schools that need to be built in your district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1922)|
| 0:32:06| A school is built somewhere else in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1926)|
| 0:32:10| How do you as a board member convince the superintendent that, hey, here's what our need is here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1930)|
| 0:32:18| How do you get your school on the radar screen with the superintendent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1938)|
| 0:32:23| Well, Commissioner Smith, I think that that's a process of working with the other school board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1943)|
| 0:32:31| You can't work in a vacuum and you definitely can't work alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1951)|
| 0:32:38| And I think in terms of history, looking at history, you know, as I told Commissioner McKenzie earlier in terms of balance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1958)|
| 0:32:48| there should be not that just the squeaky wheel gets the oil all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1968)|
| 0:32:55| Let's look at history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1975)|
| 0:32:56| Let's look at what has happened in the past and see where the schools have been built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1976)|
| 0:33:01| And then let's come up with a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1981)|
| 0:33:04| You know, I believe in business plans when you have a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1984)|
| 0:33:08| You need a road map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1988)|
| 0:33:10| So let's come up with a plan with the other school board members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1990)|
| 0:33:13| and see if there's a way to get a deserving district a school that they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=1993)|
| 0:33:22| And if so, let's work together in order to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2002)|
| 0:33:26| Now, it may not be that year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2006)|
| 0:33:29| It may be a year or two down the road, but at least get it on the radar screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2009)|
| 0:33:34| In order to do that, you have to network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2014)|
| 0:33:37| You have to talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2017)|
| 0:33:38| You've got to communicate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2018)|
| 0:33:40| In your opinion, from what you know of the district, are there any needs for a new school anywhere in your district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2020)|
| 0:33:47| I believe that there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2027)|
| 0:33:50| I know that there's not a middle school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2030)|
| 0:33:52| There's a Gibbs Elementary, Gibbs High School, but is there a Gibbs Middle School?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2032)|
| 0:33:56| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2036)|
| 0:33:58| You have Carter Elementary, Carter Middle, Carter High School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2038)|
| 0:34:02| but you really don't have that middle school to have the children funneling into the middle from those elementary schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2042)|
| 0:34:10| So there is a need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2050)|
| 0:34:12| And there may be even a need for an additional elementary school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2052)|
| 0:34:18| but definitely there's a need for a middle school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2058)|
| 0:34:23| Commissioner Burroughs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2063)|
| 0:34:27| In some areas, the school board has taxing authority and is responsible for raising their own revenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2067)|
| 0:34:36| What are your opinions on that, and do you think that would ever be a possibility in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2076)|
| 0:34:41| Do you think that's a good idea or a bad idea?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2081)|
| 0:34:47| Well, I have to answer it, and I think I alluded to this a little bit before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2087)|
| 0:34:53| In terms of the school board raising or having that ability to raise monies from a taxing entity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2093)|
| 0:35:02| I think that should be left within the public to vote in terms of raising taxes for additional funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2102)|
| 0:35:12| So, therefore, I may be kind of leaning the other way when it comes to raising money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2112)|
| 0:35:19| But if there's an opportunity to do that in another venue, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2119)|
| 0:35:26| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2126)|
| 0:35:30| Finn, no other likes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2130)|
| 0:35:32| We appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2132)|
| 0:35:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2133)|
| 0:35:34| Thank you so much for the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2134)|
| 0:35:49| Patrick Richmond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2149)|
| 0:36:01| Good evening, and thank you very much for this opportunity to address you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2161)|
| 0:36:05| Mr. Chairman, members of the Knox County Commission, and members of the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2165)|
| 0:36:10| thank you for this opportunity to address you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2170)|
| 0:36:13| My name is Patrick J. Richmond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2173)|
| 0:36:15| I reside with my wife, Diane, at 6609 East Emory Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37938.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2175)|
| 0:36:25| I speak to you as a concerned member of the Gibbs community to place my name in nomination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2185)|
| 0:36:30| for the vacated school board seat from the 8th District of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2190)|
| 0:36:36| I have lived in the Knoxville area for most of my life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2196)|
| 0:36:39| or excuse me, the Northwest area of Knoxville for most of my life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2199)|
| 0:36:43| and in the Gibbs community for the last 12 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2203)|
| 0:36:47| I have 36 years of active service to the Knox County school system as a teacher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2207)|
| 0:36:52| and computer technician at Northwest Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2212)|
| 0:36:56| The knowledge I would bring to the board would be helpful in searching for solutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2216)|
| 0:37:01| to our many problems, such as issues with the budget, retention of quality educators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2221)|
| 0:37:07| and administrators, and searching for the most effective methods to educate our children of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2227)|
| 0:37:15| Although I have never sought political office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2235)|
| 0:37:18| I have always kept up with local and national issues of education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2238)|
| 0:37:24| I believe that the involvement of community members is essential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2244)|
| 0:37:28| Therefore, I am the best candidate to fill this District 8 seat on the school board in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2248)|
| 0:37:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2254)|
| 0:37:38| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2258)|
| 0:37:40| Thank you again, Mr. Richmond, for putting your name out and sending us your resume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2260)|
| 0:37:45| Do you see yourself as a caretaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2265)|
| 0:37:47| Do you intend to run for this position?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2267)|
| 0:37:49| How do you see yourself in this role?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2269)|
| 0:37:52| At the moment, I have not made a final decision as to whether I will run for the full seat or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2272)|
| 0:37:59| But at the moment, speaking, I would be considering myself as a caretaker for the time being.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2279)|
| 0:38:08| But I would still give it my all to do the best job that I know how to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2288)|
| 0:38:15| for our children and for the community of Knox County in general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2295)|
| 0:38:22| mainly for the students and people of Gibbs Community in the 8th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2302)|
| 0:38:31| You've got quite a resume in terms of being an assistant principal as well as a principal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2311)|
| 0:38:37| You were also a principal intern for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2317)|
| 0:38:39| What do you see as the, if you were to categorize the number one or number two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2319)|
| 0:38:43| or two priorities in the Knox County schools and in the 8th District, what would those be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2323)|
| 0:38:52| It's very difficult to answer a question like that because I'm not sure that it's very easy to categorize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2332)|
| 0:39:02| a particular problem as number one or number two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2342)|
| 0:39:06| It depends a lot on your perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2346)|
| 0:39:11| And number one, I guess, I would put getting and keeping quality teachers, quality educators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2351)|
| 0:39:19| and quality administrators in our building that care about our students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2359)|
| 0:39:24| that not only care about giving them a quality education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2364)|
| 0:39:29| but turning them into a quality people that will make good citizens as adults on down the line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2369)|
| 0:39:41| and giving them the tools, not indoctrination, but giving them the tools to do this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2381)|
| 0:39:48| through the education that they would receive in my class or in my office if I was an administrator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2388)|
| 0:39:56| And just making sure that they have a very well-rounded education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2396)|
| 0:40:02| It's one thing to teach them U.S. history, but to teach them how to take that history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2402)|
| 0:40:09| and use it in a manner in which they can not only consolidate the information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2409)|
| 0:40:16| but make use of that information is two totally different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2416)|
| 0:40:22| And I think largely that we have a tendency, we can teach it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2422)|
| 0:40:28| but can we actually show our students how this information can be consolidated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2428)|
| 0:40:35| and used in other areas that this child may choose to go into later on in life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2435)|
| 0:40:43| The number two issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2443)|
| 0:40:51| As an administrator, I would probably see another issue among many others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2451)|
| 0:40:56| It really is very hard to quantitate the issues as to one and two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2456)|
| 0:41:02| but I would suppose just keeping the school in top-notch shape, not only in the facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2462)|
| 0:41:09| but also in the textbooks, the technical aspect, keeping our machinery working properly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2469)|
| 0:41:19| so that our students can use that equipment, whether it be in a shop class| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2479)|
| 0:41:25| or in a technology situation or in the library with using the Internet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2485)|
| 0:41:32| and making sure that they have the tools to form the necessary thought patterns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2492)|
| 0:41:41| to be successful adults.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2501)|
| 0:41:47| Commissioner Thondef.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2507)|
| 0:41:49| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2509)|
| 0:41:50| And thank you, Mr. Richmond, for submitting yourself to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2510)|
| 0:41:54| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2514)|
| 0:41:56| Same question that I asked Ms. Porter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2516)|
| 0:41:58| In an era of very scarce resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2518)|
| 0:42:01| how can you as a school board member help those in the classroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2521)|
| 0:42:06| and in administration deliver more for the same dollar or less?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2526)|
| 0:42:16| Not being totally familiar with the budgeting process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2536)|
| 0:42:21| even though I'm somewhat familiar with it just from what I did on my own in the technology area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2541)|
| 0:42:27| when I was asked to by my principal in collecting data for submission to the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2547)|
| 0:42:37| to buy particular amounts of equipment, things of this nature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2557)|
| 0:42:45| keeping within a budget or even asking for more money is a very difficult thing to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2565)|
| 0:42:56| because it's real hard to determine in a school situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2576)|
| 0:43:00| that if Teacher A needs 45 reading books of novels for their child| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2580)|
| 0:43:09| and Teacher B needs three new computers so that the students can search information out on the Web| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2589)|
| 0:43:17| in their classroom at a faster rate and make more sense of that data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2597)|
| 0:43:23| and also Teacher C might need an extra several hours of training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2603)|
| 0:43:32| that's not provided by the school system for one reason or another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2612)|
| 0:43:36| and maybe they've requested money to go to the school that they found either locally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2616)|
| 0:43:44| through their own searching or through listening to other teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2624)|
| 0:43:51| that may have also been to these other academies or other technical teaching areas for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2631)|
| 0:44:02| that it's very difficult to decide where you're going to spend the money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2642)|
| 0:44:06| and how you're going to allocate that money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2646)|
| 0:44:09| when you're pulled from one end of the spectrum to the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2649)|
| 0:44:15| And I think eventually you just have to make hard decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2655)|
| 0:44:20| that this money will be spent here and there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2660)|
| 0:44:24| maybe in areas that some don't see that it's really useful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2664)|
| 0:44:30| but yet it's critical to the operation of the particular school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2670)|
| 0:44:36| And others see it as being foolhardy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2676)|
| 0:44:41| Well, okay, maybe it is, maybe it isn't, but you make a call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2681)|
| 0:44:46| and these calls are very difficult at times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2686)|
| 0:44:49| Saving money is something we all want to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2689)|
| 0:44:53| but that is very difficult when it comes to our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2693)|
| 0:44:59| We want to give them the best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2699)|
| 0:45:02| and what is the best to me may not be the same to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2702)|
| 0:45:07| or to any other members of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2707)|
| 0:45:10| It's not an easy choice, as we know, dealing with children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2710)|
| 0:45:16| whether it be our own children or someone else's children in a classroom situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2716)|
| 0:45:22| And on a field trip, I know that I have X amount of dollars that I can spend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2722)|
| 0:45:31| for whatever it is that we're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2731)|
| 0:45:37| but yet whenever we go out to eat, which usually on field trips,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2737)|
| 0:45:41| we'll go to McDonald's or someplace like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2741)|
| 0:45:45| that usually the children love to go to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2745)|
| 0:45:48| Adults may not, but children love to go to these areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2748)|
| 0:45:53| But when you see a child that will not ask you for a dollar or two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2753)|
| 0:46:02| because they don't have it, it breaks your heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2762)|
| 0:46:06| So you find some way to slip them the money so that they can save face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2766)|
| 0:46:15| You feel a little bit better and they get something in their stomach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2775)|
| 0:46:20| so they feel a whole lot better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2780)|
| 0:46:22| And this is part of not only the adult's growing process but also the child's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2782)|
| 0:46:31| because they learn that to give is to get a very, I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2791)|
| 0:46:41| it's kind of hard to describe, but it's kind of that inner feeling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2801)|
| 0:46:45| that you just feel a whole lot better for yourself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2805)|
| 0:46:49| that you did something for the child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2809)|
| 0:46:52| And it's hard to tell a child no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2812)|
| 0:46:56| Commissioner Armstrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2816)|
| 0:46:58| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2818)|
| 0:47:01| Mr. Richmond, thank you for coming in tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2821)|
| 0:47:03| I truly appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2823)|
| 0:47:06| I'm going to ask you the same question as before because in the past I've heard the terms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2826)|
| 0:47:12| you know, like great schools, world-class schools, superior education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2832)|
| 0:47:18| What do you see and what do you believe makes a great education?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2838)|
| 0:47:22| And as a board member, how would you measure the Knox County schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2842)|
| 0:47:26| in determining that we are getting a great education?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2846)|
| 0:47:30| Well, I find the term of great education to be somewhat ambiguous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2850)|
| 0:47:36| in the terms that each one of us here probably has a little definition difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2856)|
| 0:47:43| of what a great education is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2863)|
| 0:47:46| I, as someone that has a master's degree, then I have higher expectations than others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2866)|
| 0:47:54| Whereas with a child that's still growing, still learning, still maturing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2874)|
| 0:48:00| that great education probably needs to consist of not only your math, your English,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2880)|
| 0:48:08| your reading, your technology, but also the person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2888)|
| 0:48:13| And sometimes in education we tend to forget that, that these kids are exactly that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2893)|
| 0:48:22| They're children, and these children need to be loved and cared for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2902)|
| 0:48:31| and taught that there is a right and wrong, there is good and bad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2911)|
| 0:48:39| but there's ways of treating everything as a good if you just learn how to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2919)|
| 0:48:46| There's ways that you can be evil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2926)|
| 0:48:50| There's ways that you can be cruel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2930)|
| 0:48:53| But at the same time, the rewards you get out of being a merciful person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2933)|
| 0:49:00| and someone that cares about their fellow students or fellow teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2940)|
| 0:49:06| or just fellow human beings is something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2946)|
| 0:49:10| And that's hard to ingrain in a student that has not had that TLC along the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2950)|
| 0:49:21| and not had the teachings except a school of hard knocks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2961)|
| 0:49:29| which most all of us know what that is, but we were able to come through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2969)|
| 0:49:34| And we had parents that led us in the proper ways that we needed to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2974)|
| 0:49:40| and would tell us up front, one way or another, this is what's right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2980)|
| 0:49:48| and not leave any ambiguity in it whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2988)|
| 0:49:53| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2993)|
| 0:49:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2995)|
| 0:49:56| Two questions that are both kind of comparative in nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=2996)|
| 0:50:01| First, I'll kind of steal one that Commissioner Burroughs asked last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3001)|
| 0:50:05| It looks like, looking at your experience, most of it is in the urban core.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3005)|
| 0:50:13| All of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3013)|
| 0:50:14| All of it is in the urban core,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3014)|
| 0:50:16| whereas the 8th District is primarily rural areas, a couple of suburban areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3016)|
| 0:50:23| but primarily rural areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3023)|
| 0:50:25| So the first question is, how would you handle that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3025)|
| 0:50:30| You know, your experience is in one pod,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3030)|
| 0:50:32| and you'll be serving kind of a different group of kids and parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3032)|
| 0:50:38| And then the second one is one that I asked last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3038)|
| 0:50:42| You know, there's a constant conversation regarding how do we fund systems?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3042)|
| 0:50:48| What kind of money do we put in that central office, Andrew Johnson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3048)|
| 0:50:53| across the way here compared to how much money do we put in the actual classroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3053)|
| 0:50:58| dealing with teachers, assistants, and principals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3058)|
| 0:51:01| So how do you view that in terms of how a system should fund a program like Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3061)|
| 0:51:09| As far as the rural systems versus the urban system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3069)|
| 0:51:14| I find that children are children no matter where you are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3074)|
| 0:51:21| that they have a lot of the same wants, the same desires,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3081)|
| 0:51:26| and they have a lot of the same inner problems as their fellow student across the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3086)|
| 0:51:38| whether you want to call it across the tracks, whatever, I don't care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3098)|
| 0:51:42| But it's still a child's child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3102)|
| 0:51:45| And when they're growing, particularly in the middle school area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3105)|
| 0:51:50| that's an area in itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3110)|
| 0:51:54| And it takes each level, I find, takes special people to work in those areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3114)|
| 0:52:01| particularly for long lengths of time until something in our heads click that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3121)|
| 0:52:09| oh, this is the best way for me to handle these students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3129)|
| 0:52:14| And I find that that's pretty much true for all students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3134)|
| 0:52:19| that as long as you give them the proper TLCs, you give them a happy face,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3139)|
| 0:52:28| yeah, they're going to see you angry once in a while,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3148)|
| 0:52:31| but that anger is directed at their behaviors, not at them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3151)|
| 0:52:37| But they see you also come back and say, okay, Johnny,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3157)|
| 0:52:44| let's sit down and you and I discuss what you did, not in anger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3164)|
| 0:52:52| but as man-to-man or man-to-child or man-to-daughter, whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3172)|
| 0:53:02| so that they understand that, okay, yeah, I did something wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3182)|
| 0:53:07| but now this teacher is willing to meet me halfway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3187)|
| 0:53:13| And that will give them a little something else up here that as they grow to think about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3193)|
| 0:53:22| that there are other ways to handle solving their issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3202)|
| 0:53:26| And I don't care where they come from, at least in my humble opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3206)|
| 0:53:30| that all children are like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3210)|
| 0:53:33| All children will respond if we give them half a chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3213)|
| 0:53:38| And the education that they receive from me or any other teacher should be exactly the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3218)|
| 0:53:47| We are teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3227)|
| 0:53:48| We are not dictators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3228)|
| 0:53:50| We are not someone that's going to tell them, I want you to vote for this person, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3230)|
| 0:53:57| I don't care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3237)|
| 0:53:58| I want you to have the marbles up here, the ability to think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3238)|
| 0:54:04| And that is difficult to teach our students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3244)|
| 0:54:10| because they have so much as young adults trying just to grow up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3250)|
| 0:54:17| let alone try to get all this other adult thinking in their head and make sense of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3257)|
| 0:54:24| And we've got to help that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3264)|
| 0:54:27| Of course, the math and the reading and the sciences and the technology,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3267)|
| 0:54:32| they're all important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3272)|
| 0:54:34| But teaching that child to think for themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3274)|
| 0:54:41| and to be able to correlate all that information in their heads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3281)|
| 0:54:49| and be able to put it in a stack| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3289)|
| 0:54:52| and come up with the best solution for their problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3292)|
| 0:54:56| is the best thing you can give to that child,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3296)|
| 0:54:59| because that's something that's going to carry them through their adult lives the whole time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3299)|
| 0:55:04| And the rest of it, if we can teach them to read, write,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3304)|
| 0:55:09| and as they would say on some of the shows, cipher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3309)|
| 0:55:13| that that would be secondary to teaching them how to become adults| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3313)|
| 0:55:22| that can be successful in our society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3322)|
| 0:55:27| As far as the money is concerned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3327)|
| 0:55:31| I suppose that's the age-old problem that your parents, my parents, you and I have all along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3331)|
| 0:55:42| through all of the ages to find ways to get us money, to spend it wisely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3342)|
| 0:55:51| to be sure to the best of our ability that this money is going to where it's needed the most,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3351)|
| 0:56:01| whether it be a school on the other side of the tracks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3361)|
| 0:56:05| or the school on the side of the tracks that I'm on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3365)|
| 0:56:08| They're making a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3368)|
| 0:56:09| It needs to be equitable, and that's a hard thing to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3369)|
| 0:56:14| What's equitable to me is not necessarily equitable to someone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3374)|
| 0:56:22| Commissioner Lupow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3382)|
| 0:56:23| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3383)|
| 0:56:26| Mr. Richmond, I appreciate your stepping forward tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3386)|
| 0:56:31| and offering your service for the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3391)|
| 0:56:34| I see you've been working for a number of years at Northwest Middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3394)|
| 0:56:40| I just want to go ahead and let you know my sister-in-law, Cheryl Gray,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3400)|
| 0:56:45| has been a teacher for many, many years, and I will give her a call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3405)|
| 0:56:50| and just do part of my homework in trying to figure out how I'm going to vote on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3410)|
| 0:56:59| I was going to ask pretty much the same question that Commissioner McKenzie asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3419)|
| 0:57:03| about the differences that you feel that having taught in an urban situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3423)|
| 0:57:09| versus the area being more rural for the 8th District and saying that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3429)|
| 0:57:17| but you've already answered that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3437)|
| 0:57:19| But I do want to let you know how much I appreciate all the years of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3439)|
| 0:57:23| I've heard, quote, war stories that Cheryl has gone through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3443)|
| 0:57:28| and I'm sure you have gone through it there at Northwest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3448)|
| 0:57:32| And I appreciate your service and what you've done for the kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3452)|
| 0:57:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3456)|
| 0:57:38| Yes, I know, Cheryl, we've known each other for probably longer than either one of us wants to admit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3458)|
| 0:57:47| We had differences of opinion as adults, and people do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3467)|
| 0:57:55| but yet we were always able to come back to a point where we could both work with each other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3475)|
| 0:58:03| without any problem whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3483)|
| 0:58:06| And she's a very good person and a very good educator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3486)|
| 0:58:11| She really cares about her kids, not only her own family, but also everyone at Northwest as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3491)|
| 0:58:19| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3499)|
| 0:58:21| And that's also what I've found of just about every teacher I've ever worked with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3501)|
| 0:58:28| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3508)|
| 0:58:31| Yes, hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3511)|
| 0:58:32| Thanks again for coming out tonight and for putting yourself through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3512)|
| 0:58:39| My question to you is the same as to Ms. Porter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3519)|
| 0:58:43| How do you feel about school boards having their own taxing authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3523)|
| 0:58:47| and being able to raise revenue that they need on their own?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3527)|
| 0:58:53| That's an issue that here in the South will use to get you lynched in one way or another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3533)|
| 0:59:01| whereas if you go up north, that's a little more acceptable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3541)|
| 0:59:07| because that's something they've done in their historical backgrounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3547)|
| 0:59:11| But here in the South, taxes are something that none of us want to pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3551)|
| 0:59:18| However, one of the easiest places and perhaps the only place that an entity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3558)|
| 0:59:29| a government entity particularly, can gather money is through the taxing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3569)|
| 0:59:38| that a body is given the power to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3578)|
| 0:59:42| But even if you had that power, you have to be very careful with the public's money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3582)|
| 0:59:49| You can't just indiscriminately, like some areas in medieval society that I'm sure that we all can think of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3589)|
| 1:00:00| that just because I wanted to go somewhere, I'm going to charge my people an extra one percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3600)|
| 1:00:06| No, we can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3606)|
| 1:00:08| We've come a long way since that time in the fact that we care more about our fellow citizen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3608)|
| 1:00:20| in this case in Knox County and in particular the 8th District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3620)|
| 1:00:24| that taxing is something that we, for various reasons of our own, are tired of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3624)|
| 1:00:35| sick and tired of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3635)|
| 1:00:37| But yet, as taxes or, excuse me, as pricing in all areas of our society continues to climb| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3637)|
| 1:00:48| and belts continue to be tightened, you're running out of options as to what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3648)|
| 1:00:57| And nobody likes to pay more taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3657)|
| 1:01:00| I don't either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3660)|
| 1:01:01| But I also know that I want the best schools in my district that I can get, and that takes money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3661)|
| 1:01:09| I don't care how you turn it, it's money that's going to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3669)|
| 1:01:13| It's not going to be the answer, not totally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3673)|
| 1:01:17| There are too many variables in a child's life or in the life of a school teacher, an administrator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3677)|
| 1:01:26| and the community, that money cannot answer everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3686)|
| 1:01:33| We have to look further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3693)|
| 1:01:35| As I've said earlier, the inner person, try to rear the entire community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3695)|
| 1:01:43| And the whole idea that it takes a village to raise someone, a child, it also takes to raise us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3703)|
| 1:01:55| to be more inclusive, to be more open to, okay, what can we do with our money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3715)|
| 1:02:04| How can we spend it more logically?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3724)|
| 1:02:09| Do the procurement system in the particular, in this case, the school board, need to be changed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3729)|
| 1:02:18| Possibly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3738)|
| 1:02:19| Where every school has to buy certain pieces of equipment from X, Y, or Z company that's on the county bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3739)|
| 1:02:34| Or can they go out and get their own three bids and get it set up to where, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3754)|
| 1:02:40| school A buys from here, school B buys from there, and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3760)|
| 1:02:44| Well, I think you're looking at a big problem if you do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3764)|
| 1:02:48| And I don't think in any department in this county, or in any other county for that matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3768)|
| 1:02:54| that that's been totally eliminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3774)|
| 1:02:58| That's something hard to deal with when you're looking at a county that covers many square miles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3778)|
| 1:03:06| and each and every school system is somewhat autonomous in their own ways of doing things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3786)|
| 1:03:14| Although that is controlled to a certain extent, it's not perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3794)|
| 1:03:21| Chairman King-Cannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3801)|
| 1:03:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3803)|
| 1:03:24| Actually, my question was asked and answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3804)|
| 1:03:26| Thank you, Mr. Richmond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3806)|
| 1:03:28| Seeing no other likes, thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3808)|
| 1:03:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3810)|
| 1:03:36| Roy Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3816)|
| 1:03:48| Mr. Chairman, members of the Commission, I'm Roy Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3828)|
| 1:03:53| I live at 9220 Emory Road, Northeast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3833)|
| 1:03:57| I've lived there all my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3837)|
| 1:04:00| I appreciate the opportunity to be here and to ask you for your consideration for the interim period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3840)|
| 1:04:08| that's vacant in the 8th District on the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3848)|
| 1:04:13| As noted in my resume, I think my experience of having worked 45 years for the school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3853)|
| 1:04:22| gives me a unique opportunity to be aware of the needs not only in the 8th District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3862)|
| 1:04:29| but throughout the entire school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3869)|
| 1:04:33| I'm certainly very aware of the budgeting process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3873)|
| 1:04:36| and the difficulties that arise in that process of the capital needs throughout the entire system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3876)|
| 1:04:43| and certainly the capital needs in the 8th District as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3883)|
| 1:04:48| I've submitted my qualifying petition to the Election Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3888)|
| 1:04:52| I intend to run in the May primary and the general election for the remaining two years left| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3892)|
| 1:04:59| in this particular position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3899)|
| 1:05:02| My wife and I have four grandchildren and two great-grandchildren| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3902)|
| 1:05:07| attending four Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3907)|
| 1:05:10| So, as a result, I have a very personal and professional interest in success| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3910)|
| 1:05:15| and the future for the growth and development in the Knox County school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3915)|
| 1:05:21| Commissioner Wright, let me respond to your questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3921)|
| 1:05:28| A question about funding throughout the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3928)|
| 1:05:34| Is there any one part of the district that has been shortchanged?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3934)|
| 1:05:38| I don't care where you go in this district, no matter whether it's in the 8th District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3938)|
| 1:05:43| or the 1st District or the 9th District or the 7th District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3943)|
| 1:05:46| somebody is going to tell you, I've been shortchanged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3946)|
| 1:05:49| I need more teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3949)|
| 1:05:51| I need more equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3951)|
| 1:05:52| I need something done to my school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3952)|
| 1:05:54| I need an addition on my school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3954)|
| 1:05:56| I need a new school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3956)|
| 1:05:58| Everybody out there has needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3958)|
| 1:06:01| And having heard those in the past in many ways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3961)|
| 1:06:05| I think it would be very difficult to say anybody is shortchanged from my perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3965)|
| 1:06:10| but I do understand how individual communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3970)|
| 1:06:14| and individual schools feel like that they need more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3974)|
| 1:06:19| I guess anybody could ask themselves, do you want more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3979)|
| 1:06:22| Yes, you want more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3982)|
| 1:06:24| So, I think that throughout this entire district there's been a concerted effort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3984)|
| 1:06:29| through my experiences, to try to meet the needs of all boys and girls throughout Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3989)|
| 1:06:35| I really don't believe that we have purposely shortchanged any part of the entire district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=3995)|
| 1:06:42| Looking at policies and procedures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4002)|
| 1:06:45| certainly the school board reviews policies and procedures every year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4005)|
| 1:06:49| and different board members have the opportunity to review certain sections of board policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4009)|
| 1:06:53| and come back and make recommendations and discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4013)|
| 1:06:56| and eventually vote on any kind of alterations or changes to those policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4016)|
| 1:07:01| The horrific tragedy that's occurred recently at Inskip School, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4021)|
| 1:07:05| looks at addressing the issue of safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4025)|
| 1:07:09| I've been part of the safety issue in Knox County schools for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4029)|
| 1:07:13| I served on a task force to evaluate what we've done and what we could do differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4033)|
| 1:07:17| We made some changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4037)|
| 1:07:19| It's something that you have to constantly address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4039)|
| 1:07:21| and I think that's something that needs some review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4041)|
| 1:07:25| We need to look to see how we address safety issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4045)|
| 1:07:28| see if we can improve what we do as it relates to school safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4048)|
| 1:07:33| I think that my experience has been the schools are one of the safest places you can be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4053)|
| 1:07:39| When I was responsible for transportation, I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4059)|
| 1:07:41| if I'm going to have an accident, I want to be on a school bus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4061)|
| 1:07:45| because a school bus is built to meet certain federal requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4065)|
| 1:07:49| so it's one of the safest vehicles, I think, that you can be in if you're going to have an accident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4069)|
| 1:07:53| The only unfortunate thing about a school bus is sometimes they're top heavy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4073)|
| 1:07:56| and so they tend to roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4076)|
| 1:07:58| But at the same time, it's very seldom that one is crushed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4078)|
| 1:08:03| Since the tragic accident in Kentucky, gas tanks are very well reinforced on school buses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4083)|
| 1:08:08| so they're not on other vehicles to prevent any kind of puncture or rupture that would create a fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4088)|
| 1:08:13| There's a number of certainly ways to get off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4093)|
| 1:08:18| I think safety is something that you constantly have to have out in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4098)|
| 1:08:22| We need to probably look at that process and see if we're doing it the very best we possibly can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4102)|
| 1:08:28| and see if there's something we've overlooked we need to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4108)|
| 1:08:32| I think we also need to constantly look at our hiring process and our process of non-renewal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4112)|
| 1:08:40| Non-renewal is tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4120)|
| 1:08:42| I've dealt with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4122)|
| 1:08:45| It's one of the most difficult things in the world to look somebody in the face and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4125)|
| 1:08:48| I can't recommend you for reemployment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4128)|
| 1:08:52| That's hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4132)|
| 1:08:54| It's gut-wrenching because somebody's gone to school for four or five years to teach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4134)|
| 1:09:00| and for some reason they're not successful for whatever the reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4140)|
| 1:09:05| But I always say the best decision to make in this world is what is the best decision for boys and girls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4145)|
| 1:09:12| Well, the best decision for boys and girls is to have the very best teacher you can possibly have in that classroom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4152)|
| 1:09:17| the very best, one that can reach kids, one that conveys to kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4157)|
| 1:09:22| I care about you, and kids will respond and they'll learn and they'll make progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4162)|
| 1:09:29| So I think that's very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4169)|
| 1:09:34| I'd be pleased to respond to any questions that you might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4174)|
| 1:09:37| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4177)|
| 1:09:40| Ms. Reynolds, again, thank you for stepping forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4180)|
| 1:09:42| and putting your name into consideration for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4182)|
| 1:09:44| You said you know what the capital needs are in the 8th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4184)|
| 1:09:46| What are those needs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4186)|
| 1:09:49| One of the major capital needs in the 8th District has to do with the Carter community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4189)|
| 1:09:54| The gym for Carter Middle School is probably the smallest gym.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4194)|
| 1:10:00| It is the smallest gym in all of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4200)|
| 1:10:03| It's woefully inadequate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4203)|
| 1:10:05| That certainly needs to be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4205)|
| 1:10:07| There are needs at Carter Elementary School that need to be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4207)|
| 1:10:11| I can remember going all the way back to Alan Morgan when he was superintendent of schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4211)|
| 1:10:15| of looking at the need for handicapping issues at Carter Elementary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4215)|
| 1:10:20| addressing space issues at Carter Elementary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4220)|
| 1:10:23| addressing the fact that the office is in the back of the school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4223)|
| 1:10:26| which is not conducive to meeting the needs of parents and visitors to the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4226)|
| 1:10:31| So I'm very much aware that that is certainly a need that needs to be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4231)|
| 1:10:37| It needs to be addressed in the very near future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4237)|
| 1:10:42| I am personally aware of having worked with Mr. Dillingham and U Construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4242)|
| 1:10:47| that there is a plan underway to do some additions, renovations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4247)|
| 1:10:51| and modifications that addresses those needs in the Carter community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4251)|
| 1:10:56| What about Gibbs Middle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4256)|
| 1:10:58| Gibbs Middle has always been a need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4258)|
| 1:11:00| I can remember in about 1992 when Gibbs Middle disappeared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4260)|
| 1:11:06| And that community up there has continually expressed the desire and need for Gibbs Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4266)|
| 1:11:13| I can remember the time that it got to the point that the only time I would shop at the local grocery store| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4273)|
| 1:11:18| was right before closing time because when I went in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4278)|
| 1:11:22| I was constantly asked, when are we going to get a middle school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4282)|
| 1:11:25| When are we going to get a middle school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4285)|
| 1:11:26| When are we going to get a middle school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4286)|
| 1:11:28| And I said, I don't know when we're going to get a middle school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4288)|
| 1:11:32| I know when Jim Williams ran for the school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4292)|
| 1:11:37| he was besieged with the same request about a middle school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4297)|
| 1:11:41| We lost a middle school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4301)|
| 1:11:42| We want it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4302)|
| 1:11:43| I expressed to Mr. Williams, I said, Mr. Williams,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4303)|
| 1:11:45| I think the first thing you need to address with the school board is let's get a Gibbs Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4305)|
| 1:11:52| The Gibbs Elementary School was an open space school that was built many, many years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4312)|
| 1:11:58| Open space was not very popular, and then along came walls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4318)|
| 1:12:02| And Gibbs Elementary School had walls constructed throughout, cut up in space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4322)|
| 1:12:07| I'm very much aware of that because my wife taught there for several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4327)|
| 1:12:10| And I said, Mr. Williams, we've got at that time I think six temporary classrooms located around Gibbs Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4330)|
| 1:12:18| Let's get a new elementary school in this community, desperately needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4338)|
| 1:12:22| If we can get a school and we build it for a thousand with the ability to expand it to 1,200,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4342)|
| 1:12:27| I said that will develop growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4347)|
| 1:12:30| It's like building the pyramid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4350)|
| 1:12:32| You have to start at the base and build up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4352)|
| 1:12:35| And that will attract families in this community with a new elementary school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4355)|
| 1:12:38| That will produce the growth that's going to be necessary that someday there will be the need for a Gibbs Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4358)|
| 1:12:44| We have the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4364)|
| 1:12:46| It's located directly behind Gibbs Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4366)|
| 1:12:49| In fact, there's a road that goes up there with a cul-de-sac that occasionally I get stacked up on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4369)|
| 1:12:55| when I go to pick up my granddaughter there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4375)|
| 1:12:58| So the opportunity is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4378)|
| 1:13:00| It's just when the demand is based on the growth and the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4380)|
| 1:13:05| My final question, do you feel that there needs to be a better working relationship between the school board and this commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4385)|
| 1:13:12| Commissioner, I have always believed that the better that you communicate with people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4392)|
| 1:13:20| and establish a relationship with them, the more positive the outcome is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4400)|
| 1:13:25| And I've been aware of that throughout my tenure of working with Knox County Schools, and that's not going to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4405)|
| 1:13:33| When you have an adversarial relationship, two people lose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4413)|
| 1:13:38| When you have a relationship where people work together for a common goal, be it the school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4418)|
| 1:13:44| be it city council, be it county commission, be it state legislature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4424)|
| 1:13:48| you have a very positive outcome because everybody understands the goals and objectives that you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4428)|
| 1:13:54| And so, yes, I think any time you can improve a working relationship, you have a better positive outcome,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4434)|
| 1:14:00| which ultimately is going to benefit boys and girls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4440)|
| 1:14:05| Chairman King-Cannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4445)|
| 1:14:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4447)|
| 1:14:08| Hi, Mr. Rollins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4448)|
| 1:14:09| Thanks for putting your name in like the other candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4449)|
| 1:14:12| My question is connected to your 45 years of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4452)|
| 1:14:18| You know, this started at the school level and teacher, principal, and then central office administrator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4458)|
| 1:14:24| How do you think, if you were to be appointed to this position, the transition would be for you to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4464)|
| 1:14:32| You know, you've been part of the administration, and board members not part of the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4472)|
| 1:14:38| You need to be occasionally critics of the administration, questioning and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4478)|
| 1:14:43| and also, you know, guiding the overall mission of the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4483)|
| 1:14:48| How would that transition for you be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4488)|
| 1:14:50| And also, when it comes to examining the way we have been doing things and being open to innovation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4490)|
| 1:14:58| you know, some things that might have worked really well in the 90s and 80s, maybe we need to rethink and change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4498)|
| 1:15:05| And I know you have been part of changes in your career, too, but explain how you would adapt to that different role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4505)|
| 1:15:16| Ms. King-Cannon, that is a situation that I've thought about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4516)|
| 1:15:20| and I've been in that role so long as an employee of the Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4520)|
| 1:15:25| And to turn around and be in a different role, I think I can very well make that transition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4525)|
| 1:15:34| It will not be easy, I'll be very frank with you in that respect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4534)|
| 1:15:37| because of my past association with all the people that are part of the Knox County school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4537)|
| 1:15:44| But I believe I can make that transition to, one, to evaluate the kind of programs that the superintendent puts before the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4544)|
| 1:15:53| the goals that he presents, the strategies that he presents, the budget that he presents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4553)|
| 1:15:58| I think my experience is going to allow me to have, I think, a pretty good insight into how that's going to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4558)|
| 1:16:05| and how it's going to benefit boys and girls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4565)|
| 1:16:09| I've always asked myself one question when it comes to every role I've ever had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4569)|
| 1:16:13| whether it was a classroom teacher, whether it was an administrator, whether it was a superintendent or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4573)|
| 1:16:20| One question, is what we're about to do or vote on or spend money for good for boys and girls?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4580)|
| 1:16:28| And if I can tell myself and answer that question, yes, this is good for boys and girls, I'm okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4588)|
| 1:16:34| But if I have a hesitancy in answering that question, I back off and reevaluate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4594)|
| 1:16:40| Maybe we'd better not do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4600)|
| 1:16:42| Maybe we'd better not spend this money, because I think that's the key to everything that you decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4602)|
| 1:16:47| Is this going to be good for boys and girls based on the information and the data you have to make that decision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4607)|
| 1:16:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4613)|
| 1:16:56| I'm sorry, I missed the other part of the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4616)|
| 1:16:59| No, you answered the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4619)|
| 1:17:00| It was one long compound question, but you answered it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4620)|
| 1:17:02| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4622)|
| 1:17:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4623)|
| 1:17:05| Commissioner Armstrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4625)|
| 1:17:07| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4627)|
| 1:17:08| Thank you, Mr. Mullins, for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4628)|
| 1:17:10| I appreciate you putting yourself out like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4630)|
| 1:17:12| It's a high-risk venture at best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4632)|
| 1:17:16| I do have the same question that I asked the others, but you come with a unique background,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4636)|
| 1:17:22| and I have another question to ask you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4642)|
| 1:17:25| I know I'm going to put you on the spot with this one, but you made a statement about it being good for boys and girls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4645)|
| 1:17:31| If it's good for boys and girls, you'll vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4651)|
| 1:17:33| And that was kind of the way I came to the table with the 8th District when I said if it's good for the 8th District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4653)|
| 1:17:38| and it's good for Knox County, then I'll vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4658)|
| 1:17:41| So I can understand the philosophy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4661)|
| 1:17:44| Number one, I'd like to make a second to the statement that you made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4664)|
| 1:17:47| We need a Carter Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4667)|
| 1:17:49| I've been worn out about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4669)|
| 1:17:51| I mean a Gibbs Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4671)|
| 1:17:52| I've been worn out on a Gibbs Middle School in my tenure here on County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4672)|
| 1:17:56| and tried to explain to people that I'm not in charge of what schools we build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4676)|
| 1:18:00| I can only request like they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4680)|
| 1:18:03| And Carter Elementary School is beyond repair, in my opinion, but that's another story altogether.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4683)|
| 1:18:09| And I'm aware of Carter Elementary School's needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4689)|
| 1:18:13| That being said, let's go to the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4693)|
| 1:18:15| I just wanted to let you know where I was on that table too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4695)|
| 1:18:19| You made the statement if it's good for children, then you kind of would vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4699)|
| 1:18:27| In your experiences, and I think we've had several hires here lately in the Andrew Johnson building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4707)|
| 1:18:35| are we top heavy in the central office in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4715)|
| 1:18:40| Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4720)|
| 1:18:42| No, I don't think we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4722)|
| 1:18:44| And let me go all the way back to the merger of the two school systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4724)|
| 1:18:49| We were top heavy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4729)|
| 1:18:51| And attrition took care of some of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4731)|
| 1:18:55| And then the retirement incentive took care of some more of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4735)|
| 1:18:59| And then we had an independent group to come in and evaluate central office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4739)|
| 1:19:05| And that took care of some more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4745)|
| 1:19:09| We have reduced positions at central office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4749)|
| 1:19:13| Commissioner, the thing that makes it so difficult is over 82% of the budget that comes from this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4753)|
| 1:19:21| and from the state and federal level and all levels come into the school system buys people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4761)|
| 1:19:27| And so when you look at the amount of money that makes up the school budget of 82% of its people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4767)|
| 1:19:33| you say that's a pretty significant portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4773)|
| 1:19:36| And the rest of what's left goes to repair buildings, run buses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4776)|
| 1:19:40| and do the many other things that we have to buy throughout this system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4780)|
| 1:19:45| Electricity, for example, and cooling, heating, and all the kind of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4785)|
| 1:19:49| And so that's a very small part of the pie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4789)|
| 1:19:52| And so when you look at our budget and you want to cut budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4792)|
| 1:19:57| unfortunately about the only way to make significant reductions is people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4797)|
| 1:20:02| And so when you look at that, I know in past superintendents and the current superintendent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4802)|
| 1:20:08| the evaluation starts at central office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4808)|
| 1:20:12| The evaluation starts at central office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4812)|
| 1:20:14| Are there positions that people that have retired, we don't replace them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4814)|
| 1:20:23| I wasn't replaced when I left central office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4823)|
| 1:20:26| We don't have a deputy superintendent now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4826)|
| 1:20:31| And so reductions are sometimes much easier said than made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4831)|
| 1:20:38| But obviously you have to look at personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4838)|
| 1:20:41| And, you know, I know past superintendents and the current superintendent, Dr. McIntyre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4841)|
| 1:20:46| tries to do everything possible to keep it away from the classroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4846)|
| 1:20:49| because the classroom is where the most important function takes place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4849)|
| 1:20:54| And so since you have to look at that classroom, you have to say where else can we reduce personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4854)|
| 1:20:59| Well, you can look at do we need four levels of a foreign language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4859)|
| 1:21:05| or could we get by with two levels of foreign language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4865)|
| 1:21:10| Maybe yes, maybe no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4870)|
| 1:21:13| You also start evaluating do we need driver education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4873)|
| 1:21:19| Some would advocate yes, we do, because we want safety on the roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4879)|
| 1:21:22| Kids need to know how to drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4882)|
| 1:21:25| You have to make some tough decisions there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4885)|
| 1:21:29| You know, everybody always starts looking at athletics and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4889)|
| 1:21:33| But when you start trying to deal with that, most of the cost as it relates to athletics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4893)|
| 1:21:39| that's borne by the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4899)|
| 1:21:42| It's a very difficult process, Commissioner, it really is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4902)|
| 1:21:46| And certainly people become part of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4906)|
| 1:21:48| But I really feel like that central office is not overburdened in terms of personnel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4908)|
| 1:21:54| as it relates to personnel throughout the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4914)|
| 1:21:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4917)|
| 1:21:58| Thank you for your candidness on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4918)|
| 1:21:59| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4919)|
| 1:22:00| Then I'm going to ask you the same question I've asked everyone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4920)|
| 1:22:04| From other superintendents to the current day, we've talked about world-class schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4924)|
| 1:22:08| We've had the rhetoric of, and I don't mean that in a negative way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4928)|
| 1:22:12| however way you want to put it to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4932)|
| 1:22:16| I would like, in your opinion, what makes a great school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4936)|
| 1:22:19| and what are we really after?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4939)|
| 1:22:21| What's really the product that we look for out of our non-schools to make it a great school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4941)|
| 1:22:27| And how would you measure that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4947)|
| 1:22:28| I'll tell you what makes a great school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4948)|
| 1:22:33| First of all, you have to have a great principal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4953)|
| 1:22:36| If you've got a great principal, then you've got the leadership that's going to make a difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4956)|
| 1:22:42| because that leadership is going to support the teachers in that building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4962)|
| 1:22:47| and address the needs of those teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4967)|
| 1:22:50| Leadership is key to success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4970)|
| 1:22:53| You have to have good teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4973)|
| 1:22:55| You have to have those teachers that are dedicated and committed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4975)|
| 1:22:58| You have to have an administration in that school that reaches out to the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4978)|
| 1:23:01| because that's a critical part of it too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4981)|
| 1:23:05| I have always advocated for the fact that we don't have enough parental involvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4985)|
| 1:23:10| All research shows you the more parents that you have involved in that school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4990)|
| 1:23:15| the more successful that school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4995)|
| 1:23:17| Well, parents don't get involved unless the school reaches out to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=4997)|
| 1:23:21| Now, I had kids go through the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5001)|
| 1:23:25| We were big in PTA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5005)|
| 1:23:30| You've got one teacher at the elementary level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5010)|
| 1:23:35| and then all of a sudden when you go to middle school, you've got several.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5015)|
| 1:23:38| When you go to high school, you've got several more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5018)|
| 1:23:41| It makes it difficult for parents to get involved at that level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5021)|
| 1:23:45| but that involvement is what makes a great school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5025)|
| 1:23:49| because parents know what's going on in the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5029)|
| 1:23:52| They can contribute, but you have to reach out to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5032)|
| 1:23:54| You've got to remember that parents just don't walk in the door and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5034)|
| 1:24:01| hey, I have a background in this or that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5041)|
| 1:24:06| Can I help somebody today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5046)|
| 1:24:08| You have to have some mechanism to get them involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5048)|
| 1:24:10| but if you've got a great principal, a great leader in the school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5050)|
| 1:24:13| you've got a great staff, and you've got the leadership that reaches out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5053)|
| 1:24:17| and involves the community in that school, you're going to have a great school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5057)|
| 1:24:22| To answer a question that was asked earlier, how do you measure success?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5062)|
| 1:24:30| I think when you have a youngster that comes through 12 years in any school system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5070)|
| 1:24:37| be it Knox County or anywhere else, and that youngster finishes 12 years of school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5077)|
| 1:24:41| and they have a degree, they have a diploma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5081)|
| 1:24:45| When I was a principal, I used to tell kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5085)|
| 1:24:47| that diploma that you just have doesn't measure anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5087)|
| 1:24:51| What that diploma tells you and the public is you've persevered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5091)|
| 1:24:58| You've put forth the time and the energy and the effort to earn the credits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5098)|
| 1:25:02| to graduate from X high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5102)|
| 1:25:06| But the next step beyond that is, what are you going to do beyond that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5106)|
| 1:25:10| Are you going to go to a trade school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5110)|
| 1:25:13| Are you going to go to a community college?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5113)|
| 1:25:15| Are you going to go to a four-year college?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5115)|
| 1:25:18| That's where a youngster develops into a successful person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5118)|
| 1:25:23| because they have an interest in something that they pursued on to the post-secondary level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5123)|
| 1:25:29| Then they reach a point where all of a sudden, now then, they have a job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5129)|
| 1:25:35| They probably at some point are going to have a family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5135)|
| 1:25:38| Their contributor backs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5138)|
| 1:25:40| So the investment that this commission makes and the state makes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5140)|
| 1:25:43| and the federal government makes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5143)|
| 1:25:45| you don't get a return on that investment until usually 22 to 24 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5145)|
| 1:25:50| before you really start getting a return on that investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5150)|
| 1:25:53| because all of a sudden that youngster now has completed schooling up through 12 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5153)|
| 1:25:58| and into the post-secondary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5158)|
| 1:26:01| and then all of a sudden they become a contributor back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5161)|
| 1:26:04| because they're a citizen now paying taxes, earning a living,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5164)|
| 1:26:08| and being involved in their community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5168)|
| 1:26:10| That's how I measure success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5170)|
| 1:26:15| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5175)|
| 1:26:18| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5178)|
| 1:26:19| Can you tell me how you feel about school boards having the authority to raise their own revenue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5179)|
| 1:26:26| Commissioner, I don't think you'll find a school board member that wants the authority to raise taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5186)|
| 1:26:35| There are a few places that occurs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5195)|
| 1:26:37| but I don't think you're going to find a school board that wants that authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5197)|
| 1:26:41| I really sincerely believe that if you're doing the kind of job that you need to do in education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5201)|
| 1:26:51| and you convey to the public this is what we need to continue to do this job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5211)|
| 1:26:59| and you lay it out to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5219)|
| 1:27:02| and this is what we're going to do with the resources if we get them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5222)|
| 1:27:07| I think the public would support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5227)|
| 1:27:09| We've got to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5229)|
| 1:27:11| I remember doing that a long time ago, and it worked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5231)|
| 1:27:19| It was the old county court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5239)|
| 1:27:21| So I go back a long way, ladies and gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5241)|
| 1:27:25| But we were told by the county court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5245)|
| 1:27:27| if you can convince the public to pass tax, we'll give it all to schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5247)|
| 1:27:32| We were very naive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5252)|
| 1:27:34| We did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5254)|
| 1:27:36| I stuffed mailboxes, found out that was illegal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5256)|
| 1:27:40| Wrote letters, did phone calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5260)|
| 1:27:42| We worked and worked and worked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5262)|
| 1:27:44| And guess what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5264)|
| 1:27:46| The tax passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5266)|
| 1:27:48| We got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5268)|
| 1:27:51| But unfortunately, the deck always has bottom cards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5271)|
| 1:27:58| So part of it came off the bottom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5278)|
| 1:28:00| We didn't get all of it on top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5280)|
| 1:28:04| Commissioner Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5284)|
| 1:28:06| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5286)|
| 1:28:08| Thank you, Mr. Mullins, for being here and for your incredible service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5288)|
| 1:28:12| Same question I've asked the other two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5292)|
| 1:28:15| In a nutshell, how can you as a board member, school board member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5295)|
| 1:28:19| help the administration and the teachers and the principals and so forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5299)|
| 1:28:25| produce a high-quality education with the same or reduced resources?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5305)|
| 1:28:36| Commissioner, I think, number one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5316)|
| 1:28:39| you have to do some things differently than we're doing them now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5319)|
| 1:28:44| And I'll give you an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5324)|
| 1:28:50| I don't think that we can afford classes that have eight or ten kids in them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5330)|
| 1:28:57| And when I refer to those kind of classes, I don't mean special needs classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5337)|
| 1:29:02| I'm thinking of classes that are upper-level math, upper-level science,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5342)|
| 1:29:06| upper-level language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5346)|
| 1:29:08| We have youngsters that need that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5348)|
| 1:29:10| We really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5350)|
| 1:29:12| But it's very, very difficult when you allocate a teacher that can teach that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5352)|
| 1:29:18| upper-level, whatever it might happen to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5358)|
| 1:29:23| and there's only a small number of students in there because that's the number that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5363)|
| 1:29:27| you have in that particular school that want that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5367)|
| 1:29:30| I think we have to use technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5370)|
| 1:29:33| I think we've got some things underway that would allow us to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5373)|
| 1:29:37| And we have to say, here's one teacher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5377)|
| 1:29:39| and this teacher is going to use the technology to teach this upper-level math| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5379)|
| 1:29:43| or upper-level language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5383)|
| 1:29:45| And all of our high schools, or half of our high schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5385)|
| 1:29:50| and those youngsters that want that particular will be taught by one teacher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5390)|
| 1:29:54| but it will be taught electronically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5394)|
| 1:29:57| That's a savings because instead of having five teachers doing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5397)|
| 1:30:01| one teacher is doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5401)|
| 1:30:03| Now, that's probably a drop in the big bucket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5403)|
| 1:30:06| And also another issue may be we may have to increase class sizes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5406)|
| 1:30:11| Now, I know that's a BEP issue with the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5411)|
| 1:30:14| but it may become necessary that that's a number that's going to have to go up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5414)|
| 1:30:20| and increase the number that's in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5420)|
| 1:30:22| Now, I know the school system, Knox County School System,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5422)|
| 1:30:26| does a great job of trying to keep that right at the max and not go over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5426)|
| 1:30:31| But unfortunately, when you've got, say, five first grades,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5431)|
| 1:30:37| and all those five first grades are over two kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5437)|
| 1:30:42| under the BEP we have no choice except to hire another teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5442)|
| 1:30:47| And so when you have to hire that other teacher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5447)|
| 1:30:49| then you have to take those five classes and divide it among six teachers now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5449)|
| 1:30:53| So the number drops down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5453)|
| 1:30:57| I tend to think that there ought to be a way at some level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5457)|
| 1:31:01| which goes to the state level, to allow that to exceed that number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5461)|
| 1:31:07| because then you save that teacher's salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5467)|
| 1:31:11| And that's a savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5471)|
| 1:31:13| It's a difficult process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5473)|
| 1:31:15| You do have to think about doing things differently than we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5475)|
| 1:31:18| We can't always do things the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5478)|
| 1:31:20| And sometimes in the school system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5480)|
| 1:31:23| we get somewhat habitual in how we manage and do things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5483)|
| 1:31:28| We need to think about doing them differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5488)|
| 1:31:31| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5491)|
| 1:31:34| Yes, thank you very much, Mr. Mullins, for putting yourself forward for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5494)|
| 1:31:38| It's not often that we have the opportunity to talk to someone that's had not only years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5498)|
| 1:31:43| but literally decades in senior leadership and administrative positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5503)|
| 1:31:49| This is a little bit different than the questions that have been asked before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5509)|
| 1:31:52| because it's something that I even have ambivalent feelings about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5512)|
| 1:31:57| and I'd like to get your opinion on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5517)|
| 1:31:59| And it deals with either electing or the school board searching| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5519)|
| 1:32:07| and appointing and hiring superintendent of schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5527)|
| 1:32:11| and what your thoughts are on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5531)|
| 1:32:19| Commissioner, I've worked for all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5539)|
| 1:32:24| That's why I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5544)|
| 1:32:26| We've had some great elected superintendents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5546)|
| 1:32:32| but I sincerely believe that giving the school board the authority to appoint the leader| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5552)|
| 1:32:44| is the best approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5564)|
| 1:32:47| Now, the public in general have always wanted to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5567)|
| 1:32:52| It seems like you've taken that opportunity away from me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5572)|
| 1:32:56| But as I evaluate all the leaders that Knox County has had, we've had some great ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5576)|
| 1:33:03| We have a great leader right now in Dr. Joe McNair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5583)|
| 1:33:06| Here he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5586)|
| 1:33:08| I think if the school board does its job, does its homework,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5588)|
| 1:33:13| and evaluates the applicants and the candidates that are submitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5593)|
| 1:33:18| I think that decision-making process is going to be the best to develop the right leader| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5598)|
| 1:33:23| to move the school system forward because you look for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5603)|
| 1:33:26| and select the characteristics, traits, and strengths that you see that your system needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5606)|
| 1:33:34| Commissioner Knopf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5614)|
| 1:33:36| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5616)|
| 1:33:38| Thank you, Mr. Mullins, again for your willingness to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5618)|
| 1:33:43| Certainly your experience and your credentials are exceptional, and we recognize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5623)|
| 1:33:53| You're about to enter the political arena in a different way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5633)|
| 1:33:57| not that central office isn't somewhat political, but it's certainly a different domain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5637)|
| 1:34:06| And I'm going to give you a head start on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5646)|
| 1:34:08| I'm going to throw you a couple of fastballs and get you ready for your campaign maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5648)|
| 1:34:17| First thing is, what is your status or your relationship with the school system right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5657)|
| 1:34:24| I work two days a week for the school system right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5664)|
| 1:34:26| Since I retired, I work on Tuesdays and Thursdays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5666)|
| 1:34:30| My primarily follow-up in that position has to relate to, one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5670)|
| 1:34:35| is securing and looking for property for new schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5675)|
| 1:34:42| I've been involved in the process for at least four years for a piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5682)|
| 1:34:48| in the southwest for a new elementary school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5688)|
| 1:34:52| knowing that that was a looming thing with all the growth that's occurred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5692)|
| 1:34:56| in the Farragut Primary Intermediate AL Lots area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5696)|
| 1:35:00| and the number of temporary classrooms that we've had to put around those facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5700)|
| 1:35:04| So that's a thing that I've worked on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5704)|
| 1:35:07| I've worked on for longer than that to try to get some land adjacent to Ridd Elementary School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5707)|
| 1:35:13| to try to get the traffic off of Washington Pike, and we finally succeeded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5713)|
| 1:35:16| It took a long time, but the landowners adjacent to the school have agreed to sell about four acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5716)|
| 1:35:23| We have 275 running feet on the right side of Ridd School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5723)|
| 1:35:27| and I noticed that the superintendent is placing the capital plan resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5727)|
| 1:35:31| to get that traffic off of Washington Pike, which is great,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5731)|
| 1:35:34| because if anybody's ever been through there in the morning, you know what it's like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5734)|
| 1:35:38| It backs up for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5738)|
| 1:35:40| It's a safety issue, and so I'm pleased to see that that's occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5740)|
| 1:35:45| I work and have worked with the developing transfer procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5745)|
| 1:35:50| We've got a whole new process this year for transfers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5750)|
| 1:35:56| No longer do parents have to get back to school and stand out in the cold waiting for a custodian| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5756)|
| 1:36:01| to open the door so they can go in and grab a transfer and fill it out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5761)|
| 1:36:05| and hopefully be the first one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5765)|
| 1:36:08| This is a much more equitable and fair arrangement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5768)|
| 1:36:11| I've worked with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5771)|
| 1:36:14| I probably am the guru on zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5774)|
| 1:36:23| and so I've been working on some of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5783)|
| 1:36:25| because I've done more rezoning in the school system perhaps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5785)|
| 1:36:29| or been responsible to share the reason why with the public and respond to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5789)|
| 1:36:36| So we are developing some procedures, and I've been working on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5796)|
| 1:36:40| So I guess where I'm going with the question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5800)|
| 1:36:42| what will you do if you're appointed to the position relative to what your present duties are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5802)|
| 1:36:50| The day that this commission appoints me, if you so choose to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5810)|
| 1:36:54| do so will be the last day I work for the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5814)|
| 1:36:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5817)|
| 1:36:58| The other question, which is one that probably this might be a tact that someone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5818)|
| 1:37:07| and it's kind of a spin-off of Ms. Kincannon's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5827)|
| 1:37:10| the position that you've got to be a critic of this process and so on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5830)|
| 1:37:18| and I don't see anybody any better able to criticize probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5838)|
| 1:37:22| than somebody that's been in the system as long as you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5842)|
| 1:37:25| You have an extraordinary view of the system and what takes place that's inside view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5845)|
| 1:37:30| But on the other hand, your opponent or somebody that would attack you politically would say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5850)|
| 1:37:35| yes, indeed, Mr. Mullins is the ultimate insider in terms of the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5855)|
| 1:37:41| How would you defend yourself against something like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5861)|
| 1:37:45| That very well could happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5865)|
| 1:37:46| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5866)|
| 1:37:47| I certainly appreciate where it would be coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5867)|
| 1:37:49| Certainly, I am the ultimate insider in that sense of the word| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5869)|
| 1:37:52| of having the years of experience with the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5872)|
| 1:37:55| But, Commissioner, I think my comeback to that would be, yes, I am,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5875)|
| 1:38:00| but that experience is invaluable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5880)|
| 1:38:03| I have probably a better understanding of how the whole process works than most people do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5883)|
| 1:38:10| and it's just attributable to the experience I've had in working for the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5890)|
| 1:38:14| It's a different hat, so to speak, or a different set of shoes to wear in that respect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5894)|
| 1:38:19| but I feel very confident that that's a role that I can assume| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5899)|
| 1:38:23| and carry out, I believe, very effectively,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5903)|
| 1:38:26| regardless of the prior relationship with the Knox County Administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5906)|
| 1:38:32| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5912)|
| 1:38:35| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5915)|
| 1:38:37| I just want to say thank you to Mr. Mullins for taking your time out tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5917)|
| 1:38:42| and for still having that heart to serve to make sure that our kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5922)|
| 1:38:47| and their families are taken care of in regards to raising our future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5927)|
| 1:38:55| I agree with exactly what you said and what makes a great school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5935)|
| 1:39:00| It starts with a great principal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5940)|
| 1:39:04| They are the leaders of the school in terms of how well protected their staff is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5944)|
| 1:39:11| I was very fortunate when my kids were going through that they were in schools that had very active PTAs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5951)|
| 1:39:17| and they welcomed parent participation and grandparents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5957)|
| 1:39:21| As we all know, times have changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5961)|
| 1:39:24| and our leaders in our schools have a lot more things to deal with that they didn't have years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5964)|
| 1:39:31| And one of those is being that there are a lot more single parents out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5971)|
| 1:39:36| and there are a lot more grandparents now raising their grandchildren.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5976)|
| 1:39:41| So, therefore, you're getting more and more of the family, I think, involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5981)|
| 1:39:47| where before it was probably more just the mom and dad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5987)|
| 1:39:50| But now you're seeing grandparents very active in schools and volunteering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5990)|
| 1:39:58| What is your way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5998)|
| 1:39:59| Unfortunately, I've had friends and family members that haven't been as fortunate as I was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=5999)|
| 1:40:05| by having their kids in schools where the principals wanted to have parent involvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6005)|
| 1:40:12| Because we all know, I mean, really our principals really control what goes on in their building every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6012)|
| 1:40:20| And they have a lot of say-so and a lot of power, if you want to use that word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6020)|
| 1:40:26| What can we do or school board can do, more school board, not county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6026)|
| 1:40:33| in terms of being able to make sure that our principals are welcoming of the families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6033)|
| 1:40:44| and having people come and involve and volunteer their time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6044)|
| 1:40:49| Is there, I mean, in terms of hiring process and all, is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6049)|
| 1:40:55| I mean, I've just always wondered, because the schools vary from school to school in terms of how much participation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6055)|
| 1:41:02| And that goes back to our principals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6062)|
| 1:41:04| So, with you being in education all these years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6064)|
| 1:41:07| is there a key that we're missing when we're promoting and hiring those to be principals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6067)|
| 1:41:14| I mean, in terms of their networking and their communication skills with parents and family?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6074)|
| 1:41:24| Commissioner, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6084)|
| 1:41:25| I think there's two things there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6085)|
| 1:41:28| The first thing is you have to have the right administrator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6088)|
| 1:41:33| But the second thing is every principal out there has a contract with the superintendent, every one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6093)|
| 1:41:41| And they meet with the superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6101)|
| 1:41:43| And they go over with the superintendent the goals that they have for their school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6103)|
| 1:41:49| And the superintendent may offer suggestions about things that he would like to see happen to that school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6109)|
| 1:41:56| based on his knowledge of what's going on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6116)|
| 1:41:59| That can be part of the process right there at that level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6119)|
| 1:42:02| It's from the leadership of the superintendent to say parental involvement, because I really believe that in my heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6122)|
| 1:42:10| Parental involvement's a key.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6130)|
| 1:42:11| It really is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6131)|
| 1:42:12| The next step is you have to train administrators how to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6132)|
| 1:42:17| It's like telling somebody to go do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6137)|
| 1:42:22| They may not know how, but you have to provide the appropriate training in service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6142)|
| 1:42:27| These are some ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6147)|
| 1:42:28| This is how you get parents involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6148)|
| 1:42:30| You're so right about the fact that a lot of times today grandparents are raising kids or single parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6150)|
| 1:42:36| And you say, well, I'd love to be involved, but I don't have time to be involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6156)|
| 1:42:41| One of the things that one of our administrators shared with me is a new administrator to Knox County said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6161)|
| 1:42:49| you know what I do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6169)|
| 1:42:52| I go out into the community where my parents are working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6172)|
| 1:42:57| And they have break times, usually in the morning and the afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6177)|
| 1:43:02| And what do I do when they have a break time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6182)|
| 1:43:04| I want to be there at that place, and I sit down with them and find out how many of them have a child in my school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6184)|
| 1:43:11| And I talk to them and indicate to them, I want you to be involved in your child's education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6191)|
| 1:43:17| Let's talk about what we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6197)|
| 1:43:19| Now, you know, it may be very little.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6199)|
| 1:43:21| It may be quite big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6201)|
| 1:43:24| But, you know, again, I liken this to some of the experiences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6204)|
| 1:43:28| If you didn't, as a student, have a good experience in school, it's kind of like touching the stove.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6208)|
| 1:43:41| I don't want to go back and touch the stove because I'll get burned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6221)|
| 1:43:44| So that's why I think it's so important for us to reach out because there are some adults that had a bad experience in school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6224)|
| 1:43:51| be it elementary, middle, or high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6231)|
| 1:43:54| And so with that bad experience, they don't want to go back and get involved, so we have to reach out to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6234)|
| 1:44:00| So I think the training aspect of it, the direction from the top,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6240)|
| 1:44:04| and just some ideas that others have used to work because I don't believe in inventing the wheel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6244)|
| 1:44:10| I think it's important to borrow the wheel from somebody else if it works, and let's apply it to this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6250)|
| 1:44:16| Well, and I couldn't agree more with you because sometimes it's just being asked, being asked that gets you involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6256)|
| 1:44:26| And so I applaud Dr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6266)|
| 1:44:31| That was one of the first things he said when he got here, and I've latched on to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6271)|
| 1:44:38| And I applaud him because I do think he is trying to encourage that more and more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6278)|
| 1:44:43| But you're so right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6283)|
| 1:44:44| That's the key in a great school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6284)|
| 1:44:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6287)|
| 1:44:49| Thank you, Dr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6289)|
| 1:44:52| It's Roy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6292)|
| 1:44:53| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6293)|
| 1:45:03| Jacqueline Easterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6303)|
| 1:45:08| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6308)|
| 1:45:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6310)|
| 1:45:12| Looking at the resume from Jacqueline Easterday, 3049 Reflection Bay Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6312)|
| 1:45:24| and this would be a question, I guess, for the law director, would that resume be accepted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6324)|
| 1:45:32| She's also a teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6332)|
| 1:45:36| She is not in the 8th District as a resident by her address on her resume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6336)|
| 1:45:45| If that's the case, I think in couple with the fact that she's actually employed by the school system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6345)|
| 1:45:49| I think that would be, per se, disqualifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6349)|
| 1:45:52| She could possibly resign from being a school teacher, but the residency is a surmountable block, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6352)|
| 1:46:02| Well, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6362)|
| 1:46:03| I guess I think the whole purpose, you're trying to fill someone who represents that specific district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6363)|
| 1:46:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6370)|
| 1:46:13| We'll go next from Tommy Everett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6373)|
| 1:46:21| He's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6381)|
| 1:46:24| Coming up last here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6384)|
| 1:46:26| My name is Tommy Everett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6386)|
| 1:46:28| I live at 7312 Roberts Road, Carrington, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6388)|
| 1:46:32| I'm a lifelong resident of the Gibbs community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6392)|
| 1:46:35| I went to school at Rita Elementary, Gibbs High School, worked at Gibbs, worked at Carter, worked at Hall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6395)|
| 1:46:42| spent my last 21 years at Carnes High School in the West End.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6402)|
| 1:46:49| I feel like I bring a different perspective to this as more of a person who has the possibility of being someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6409)|
| 1:46:59| who's actually been out in the field working on the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6419)|
| 1:47:04| Retired ten years ago, time flies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6424)|
| 1:47:08| I have a business that I'm working on just to have something else to do, like I don't have anything to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6428)|
| 1:47:15| I have a 128-acre farm that I work on, so I stay busy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6435)|
| 1:47:21| But I was an advocate for the kids in the Carnes community for 21 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6441)|
| 1:47:27| Some people who know me know I bring the ability to think out of the box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6447)|
| 1:47:34| I never did stay in a box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6454)|
| 1:47:36| So I think that's the key right now to being a board member is being able to think how to come up with different ideas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6456)|
| 1:47:44| and how to do things that would benefit the kids throughout Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6464)|
| 1:47:50| Again, I think there's been several questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6470)|
| 1:47:56| One about the district that would refer to Dave's question regarding or Mr. Harmon's question, I'll correct that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6476)|
| 1:48:06| about a policy as someone who is a practicing administrator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6486)|
| 1:48:13| and working as the executive director of the Principals Association of the State of Tennessee for nine years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6493)|
| 1:48:21| One of the biggest issues I think we need to keep abreast of is the safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6501)|
| 1:48:25| and disciplinary policies that the system has to make sure that we stay in a place where we can have safe schools and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6505)|
| 1:48:33| I think that needs to be constantly revisited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6513)|
| 1:48:37| As far as some area that needs to be underfunded, again, I would agree with Mr. Mullins| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6517)|
| 1:48:45| that you could argue that all districts are underfunded or not meeting their needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6525)|
| 1:48:51| It would be hard pressed to press one over the other because everybody depends on where you live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6531)|
| 1:48:57| It's how you look at things as far as where you feel like you're being shortchanged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6537)|
| 1:49:02| So it depends on where you're at in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6542)|
| 1:49:07| I'm interested in this position as a caretaker position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6547)|
| 1:49:12| I had interest in running for the position but chose not to for a particular reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6552)|
| 1:49:19| And, therefore, I'm strictly running for this position as a caretaker position between now and September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6559)|
| 1:49:26| I feel like I have the expertise and the learning curve would be real small on my part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6566)|
| 1:49:33| because I've been involved in education for 31 years, again, followed up for nine years as executive director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6573)|
| 1:49:40| of the State Principals Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6580)|
| 1:49:41| So I have a perspective of dealing with the national people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6581)|
| 1:49:46| I'm knowing what's going on and the trends and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6586)|
| 1:49:49| And I think I could bring some new ideas to the short period of time that I would be on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6589)|
| 1:49:56| But I think I could bring some ideas that would benefit their way of working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6596)|
| 1:50:04| So I'll open myself to questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6604)|
| 1:50:08| Ms. Kincannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6608)|
| 1:50:10| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6610)|
| 1:50:11| Thank you, Mr. Everett, for your years of service in Knox County Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6611)|
| 1:50:15| and also for putting yourself up for this appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6615)|
| 1:50:20| I'm going to ask you a variation of the question I've asked the other candidates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6620)|
| 1:50:25| just about how would you envision what a highly effective school board member would look like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6625)|
| 1:50:33| and how would you play that role?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6633)|
| 1:50:35| You obviously have had a long experience as an administrator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6635)|
| 1:50:39| A school board member's role is we don't get to run the schools in the same way a principal does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6639)|
| 1:50:44| It's a different level and less of a day-to-day type interaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6644)|
| 1:50:49| So how would you envision that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6649)|
| 1:50:52| Well, I would answer that question the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6652)|
| 1:50:54| Basically, I viewed my role as a principal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6654)|
| 1:50:59| When I was a principal, my view was to hire the best people I could get around me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6659)|
| 1:51:05| and then empower them with what I expected them to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6665)|
| 1:51:11| And I felt like my role was provide them the financial support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6671)|
| 1:51:16| and the materials and stuff they had to do their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6676)|
| 1:51:20| So as a board member, I have to keep that in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6680)|
| 1:51:24| And I think I'm a policymaker first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6684)|
| 1:51:27| And then my role as a board member would be that my major responsibility would be to provide the teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6687)|
| 1:51:34| and administrators throughout Knox County what they needed to have in order to do their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6694)|
| 1:51:43| So that could encompass a lot of different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6703)|
| 1:51:48| It's not all finances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6708)|
| 1:51:50| You know, everybody wants to put a dollar figure on everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6710)|
| 1:51:53| There's ways that we could do things differently to maximize the use of those dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6713)|
| 1:51:58| and so forth if we would be creating that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6718)|
| 1:52:01| So I would, you know, help to see my role as a policymaker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6721)|
| 1:52:05| and also as a role of providing the resources it takes for teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6725)|
| 1:52:10| and administrators to do their job out in the school if we expect them to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6730)|
| 1:52:16| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6736)|
| 1:52:18| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6738)|
| 1:52:20| You all have made our job difficult because I haven't heard anyone who would not make a good school board member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6740)|
| 1:52:26| I mean, the qualifications and the quality of the candidates are exceptional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6746)|
| 1:52:30| and I appreciate everyone here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6750)|
| 1:52:32| Tommy, you said you wanted to be a caretaker, and so you're looking at basically six meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6752)|
| 1:52:37| Over those six meetings, is there anything in particular that you would like to get accomplished because,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6757)|
| 1:52:42| as you mentioned, it is going to be a short period of time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6762)|
| 1:52:45| Just to see the decisions that the 8th District has represented and voices heard as well as being.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6765)|
| 1:52:54| It's not only the 8th District, it's throughout the system, the 54,000 or 60,000 plus kids that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6774)|
| 1:53:01| that we need to make the best decisions and we need to have a variety of knowledge that's out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6781)|
| 1:53:07| Again, I'm a practitioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6787)|
| 1:53:09| I've been out in the field, and I know what goes on out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6789)|
| 1:53:13| And I think there's some ideas that I could bring to the board, maybe get them to think a little bit differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6793)|
| 1:53:19| Because the whole key is thinking different than what we've been doing in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6799)|
| 1:53:23| I don't think we can continue doing what we've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6803)|
| 1:53:27| One of them is going to say the money is not going to be there for a while until the economy changes and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6807)|
| 1:53:33| So we need to, you know, do some looking at programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6813)|
| 1:53:36| Not necessarily as far away from the classroom as we can look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6816)|
| 1:53:41| You know, I think we need to look at some system programs that are maybe great programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6821)|
| 1:53:47| and I consider them luxury items as an administrator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6827)|
| 1:53:51| They were good to have, but could we do without them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6831)|
| 1:53:55| And put those resources back in the classroom to add that extra teacher and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6835)|
| 1:53:59| So I think there's some ways that we can maximize the use of our retired teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6839)|
| 1:54:05| You know, we could contract with some of those to teach that one class of nine kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6845)|
| 1:54:10| And we can maximize some use there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6850)|
| 1:54:12| I was an advocate of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6852)|
| 1:54:13| We lost several good quality teachers to retirement because we couldn't come up with a way that we could hire them part time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6853)|
| 1:54:22| They would love to come in and teach a one class period a day or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6862)|
| 1:54:26| They since do that a little bit, but I think there's ways to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6866)|
| 1:54:29| So, I mean, I had ideas as a principal, you know, of how I could operate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6869)|
| 1:54:36| and how I maximized the use of my dollars and stuff that I had to work in there at the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6876)|
| 1:54:42| So just one or two ideas, but I think, you know, we've got to think out of the box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6882)|
| 1:54:47| And some people have a hard time with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6887)|
| 1:54:50| And we can't continue doing the same thing we've done in the past based on the current situation that we're in at the present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6890)|
| 1:54:59| Mr. Armstrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6899)|
| 1:55:00| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6900)|
| 1:55:02| Mr. Everts, it's good to see you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6902)|
| 1:55:04| Are you still shooting any basketball?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6904)|
| 1:55:06| Every now and then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6906)|
| 1:55:07| I can still shoot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6907)|
| 1:55:08| I just can't run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6908)|
| 1:55:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6909)|
| 1:55:10| I'm with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6910)|
| 1:55:11| Well, I'd really like to ask you the same question that I've asked everyone else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6911)|
| 1:55:15| and that's what makes a great education and how would you measure it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6915)|
| 1:55:20| I measure it when, you know, providing the kid an opportunity to reach his potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6920)|
| 1:55:25| And sometimes we forget that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6925)|
| 1:55:27| That potential may be a plumber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6927)|
| 1:55:31| It might be an electrician.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6931)|
| 1:55:33| He might be a doctor or lawyer or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6933)|
| 1:55:36| I think sometimes we try to force kids and pigeonhole everybody to go to college.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6936)|
| 1:55:41| Reality is everybody is not equipped to go to college.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6941)|
| 1:55:45| And sometimes I think we're focused on forcing people to do things that they don't want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6945)|
| 1:55:53| So my advocacy there was to try to help the top of the kids, the top level kids, the bottom level kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6953)|
| 1:56:00| And the kids who get shortchanged are the kids in the middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6960)|
| 1:56:04| And I was a very advocate for that group, trying to provide them ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6964)|
| 1:56:09| Some of them can raise up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6969)|
| 1:56:10| And I guess I sort of look at it because that's where I was at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6970)|
| 1:56:15| And so being an advocate for those kids, for programs where they could reach their potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6975)|
| 1:56:25| And I hope we don't lose sight of that through some of the state's mandate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6985)|
| 1:56:30| and a lot of things that will affect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6990)|
| 1:56:32| But I think we need to find ways to get back to help those kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6992)|
| 1:56:37| Whatever their potential is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6997)|
| 1:56:39| a good education is providing them an opportunity to reach that potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=6999)|
| 1:56:44| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7004)|
| 1:56:45| I really appreciate that answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7005)|
| 1:56:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7007)|
| 1:56:48| Commissioner Brawls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7008)|
| 1:56:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7012)|
| 1:56:53| I'm just wondering what your take is on school boards having the authority to raise revenue for their budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7013)|
| 1:57:03| and if you think that it would make it easier for the school board to get the funds that it feels that it needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7023)|
| 1:57:11| if it had the authority to raise that revenue itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7031)|
| 1:57:15| From my dealings in Knox County, that won't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7035)|
| 1:57:21| I traveled all over the country, dealt with the National Association and so forth in dealing with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7041)|
| 1:57:26| Where that works is where the small districts where each community pretty much has their own school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7046)|
| 1:57:34| and the monies they raise, it stays there in their district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7054)|
| 1:57:38| Now, here, if the school board raises taxes, you know, everybody goes back to what we were saying a while ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7058)|
| 1:57:45| where my district is being shortchanged, I'm paying the taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7065)|
| 1:57:49| everything is going west or south or whatever, east or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7069)|
| 1:57:53| Where I know it's been successful in the people and the principals and so forth I've talked to who work with boards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7073)|
| 1:57:59| has been in small communities where it's a community school, you know, and they're willing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7079)|
| 1:58:06| those parents are willing to pay that tax because they know it's going to their school and their community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7086)|
| 1:58:13| And I think if you do your research, you'll find that that's where that taxing authority comes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7093)|
| 1:58:18| that's where it's been successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7098)|
| 1:58:20| It has, in my opinion, it can't work here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7100)|
| 1:58:26| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7106)|
| 1:58:29| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7109)|
| 1:58:30| I thought Commissioner Armstrong was going to ask a similar question that I had been asking that he asked Mr. Mullins,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7110)|
| 1:58:37| and that was about central office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7117)|
| 1:58:39| So, you know, kind of bottom line, what's your view on the size of central office as compared, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7119)|
| 1:58:46| when you served as a classroom principal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7126)|
| 1:58:48| Again, you know, I go back to central office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7128)|
| 1:58:50| You know, I think that, again, there's some programs at the central office that I consider as a practicing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7130)|
| 1:58:57| when I was principal as luxury programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7137)|
| 1:58:59| They were good programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7139)|
| 1:59:01| Don't get me wrong, they're not good programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7141)|
| 1:59:03| But in times of money, when you've got to cut, you look at luxury.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7143)|
| 1:59:07| Is that a luxury that we no longer can afford?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7147)|
| 1:59:10| If we can't afford it, then those people not cutting positions, they need to be put back in the classroom, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7150)|
| 1:59:15| because those are certified teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7155)|
| 1:59:18| That money is better spent keeping them in the classroom than it would be to continue that program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7158)|
| 1:59:23| until we were able to afford it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7163)|
| 1:59:25| People at home have got to make those decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7165)|
| 1:59:28| These are luxury items that we have right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7168)|
| 1:59:31| Can we afford to keep doing this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7171)|
| 1:59:33| Or do we have to cut back and utilize our monies more efficiently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7173)|
| 1:59:38| Because the monies are not going to go up in the near future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7178)|
| 1:59:42| So we've got to find ways to better use that money that we currently have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7182)|
| 1:59:47| And we've got to stay away from the classroom as far as we can step,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7187)|
| 1:59:51| because I just don't think you can cut teachers and maintain the quality of education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7191)|
| 1:59:57| When, you know, we've got other programs that, you know, that could be, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7197)|
| 2:00:01| and that may not be a popular thing to say, but that's just where I've looked at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7201)|
| 2:00:06| I'm a teacher advocate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7206)|
| 2:00:07| Teachers need to have the ability to teach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7207)|
| 2:00:10| and we need to provide them programs that they can have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7210)|
| 2:00:13| And are these programs, we've got luxury programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7213)|
| 2:00:16| or are they something that we could put on the back burner for a while| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7216)|
| 2:00:19| and use those monies out for teachers and so forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7219)|
| 2:00:23| until the monies become available to offer those programs again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7223)|
| 2:00:29| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7229)|
| 2:00:31| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7231)|
| 2:00:33| Thank you, Mr. Ray, for being willing to step out like this, especially also being a caretaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7233)|
| 2:00:41| You're speaking to the choir right here when you're speaking to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7241)|
| 2:00:44| I'm a retired teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7244)|
| 2:00:46| And so when you say things about teachers and the way you speak of teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7246)|
| 2:00:50| I can tell you have a great affection for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7250)|
| 2:00:53| You understand what they go through day to day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7253)|
| 2:00:57| One of the things you touched on was disciplinary policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7257)|
| 2:01:01| So from a principal and teacher standpoint, disciplinary policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7261)|
| 2:01:07| is there something specific that you think right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7267)|
| 2:01:10| can you think of some of our disciplinary policies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7270)|
| 2:01:13| Like when I'm in the classroom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7273)|
| 2:01:15| I hate to see those guys keep coming back and back and back and back with the same problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7275)|
| 2:01:21| It's unnecessary, a tremendous burden on teachers throughout the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7281)|
| 2:01:26| So is there something that you can say towards that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7286)|
| 2:01:29| Well, I just think we need to look at some programs that would do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7289)|
| 2:01:33| I understand when you're as teachers, we try to find ways to deal with those youngsters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7293)|
| 2:01:38| They need education, but, you know, we need to find programs that they could do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7298)|
| 2:01:43| some alternative type issues that we could deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7303)|
| 2:01:45| Because it's hard to deal with somebody who's in a body sitting in your classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7305)|
| 2:01:49| It's taking away from the teacher's time to deal with those other kids who want to learn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7309)|
| 2:01:54| You know, my philosophy was every kid has the right to decide to fight if they so choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7314)|
| 2:02:03| And no teacher can change that except giving them the opportunity to do that, to learn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7323)|
| 2:02:09| But if they choose not to, I mean, that's pretty hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7329)|
| 2:02:13| And so as principal, I try to find ways and deal with those parents and so forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7333)|
| 2:02:19| that I could deal with to help them to change that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7339)|
| 2:02:22| And, you know, we come up with innovative programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7342)|
| 2:02:25| I did while I was at Carnes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7345)|
| 2:02:26| I had creative programs that I come up with to try to deal in and get them extra help and make them situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7346)|
| 2:02:34| We had a problem and my teachers solved the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7354)|
| 2:02:38| And sometimes I think that's something we don't look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7358)|
| 2:02:41| The people who are closest to the problem can solve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7361)|
| 2:02:45| And that was, you know, we had a problem with kids coming out of middle school with no passing grades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7365)|
| 2:02:51| Sixty, 70, 80 kids a year that I got into Carnes High School that didn't have one passing grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7371)|
| 2:02:57| So the teachers themselves got together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7377)|
| 2:02:59| How can we solve this problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7379)|
| 2:03:01| And then, again, I was a facilitator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7381)|
| 2:03:03| There was no great idea that I come up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7383)|
| 2:03:07| We found ways to put them in small classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7387)|
| 2:03:10| And those teachers dealt with those parents almost one-on-one constantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7390)|
| 2:03:15| You know, and other teachers agreed to take more kids in order to allow those teachers to volunteer to step up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7395)|
| 2:03:23| It was strictly volunteer to teach those kids in small 15-unit classrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7403)|
| 2:03:29| And then they worked with those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7409)|
| 2:03:31| And we were amazed, that kid in that first group that I did, that we had those kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7411)|
| 2:03:38| We had 78% of those kids graduated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7418)|
| 2:03:43| But when they come into Carnes High School, they had zero passing grades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7423)|
| 2:03:49| But through working with the parents, again, parent involvement, and I'll go back to that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7429)|
| 2:03:55| You know, I don't think you can the elementary school PTA works great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7435)|
| 2:04:02| Middle school, it deteriorates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7442)|
| 2:04:04| High school, it's a disaster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7444)|
| 2:04:07| And you've got to find ways to deal with parents at the high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7447)|
| 2:04:11| Again, how do you deal with the community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7451)|
| 2:04:14| You know, I had the Carnes community, you know, supporting me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7454)|
| 2:04:17| Everybody wondered how I got to do what I could do in the Carnes community without resistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7457)|
| 2:04:21| Well, nobody knew I had a parent committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7461)|
| 2:04:24| I mean, I met, you know, I had a group of parents that I met with on a monthly basis, about 25 or 30 of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7464)|
| 2:04:32| And they were my people out there in the community getting me, being my people at large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7472)|
| 2:04:38| Again, that was an idea that I came up with to get parent involvement in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7478)|
| 2:04:43| I had a nucleus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7483)|
| 2:04:44| I had a strong 25 parent group that were my advocates out in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7484)|
| 2:04:51| And they were church oriented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7491)|
| 2:04:53| They were oriented around the church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7493)|
| 2:04:56| And I kept them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7496)|
| 2:04:57| They knew about things that we were talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7497)|
| 2:05:00| And when something would come up, they were my support out there in the community to help me get things done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7500)|
| 2:05:06| And so that was just a creative approach, nothing magical about it, but it worked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7506)|
| 2:05:13| And so that's, again, out of the box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7513)|
| 2:05:18| And I think you've got to think out of the box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7518)|
| 2:05:24| Well, thank you, Mr. Everett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7524)|
| 2:05:27| Did Jessica Blue, Matt Cannon, or Jacqueline Easterday come in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7527)|
| 2:05:35| If not, anyone from the audience want to say anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7535)|
| 2:05:40| Seeing none, this question of the – oh, I'm sorry, Dave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7540)|
| 2:05:43| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7543)|
| 2:05:45| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7545)|
| 2:05:48| I know we're a couple hours into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7548)|
| 2:05:51| It's a huge issue in the 8th District that we have a good candidate both for the appointment process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7551)|
| 2:06:03| and then someone stand up for the election process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7563)|
| 2:06:08| Whenever I first started thinking about this at the resignation of the former school board member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7568)|
| 2:06:14| I thought we may have one good candidate stand up, a candidate that we could all support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7574)|
| 2:06:20| And this just being a very short time between the appointment process and maybe the primary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7580)|
| 2:06:28| which if a person received 50 percent of the vote in the primary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7588)|
| 2:06:31| then they were the ultimate school board member anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7591)|
| 2:06:37| At first blush, I thought that might be what would happen, but I find that's not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7597)|
| 2:06:42| I find that we have several good candidates, and I've spoken to each one of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7602)|
| 2:06:47| and I appreciate the fact that we have people in the 8th District standing up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7607)|
| 2:06:53| saying that they would like to be on the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7613)|
| 2:06:55| I'd like to see another three or four or five people become interested over the next couple of years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7615)|
| 2:07:00| because this is just to fill out a term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7620)|
| 2:07:04| That's very serious to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7624)|
| 2:07:06| What I'm about to say may be taken lightly, but it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7626)|
| 2:07:11| It's serious also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7631)|
| 2:07:14| I haven't asked any questions tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7634)|
| 2:07:16| The only two questions I asked is because Commissioner Mark Harmon asked me this morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7636)|
| 2:07:22| if I would read the commission form and ask those two questions on his behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7642)|
| 2:07:27| The candidates were good enough to remember those questions, and everyone answered those questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7647)|
| 2:07:34| The problem I've got boils down to Tommy is like a cousin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7654)|
| 2:07:41| He's married to my cousin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7661)|
| 2:07:43| Whenever my grandparents were alive, he was at Christmas dinner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7663)|
| 2:07:48| His daughter is the same age as our son.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7668)|
| 2:07:54| And then sitting right there beside him is Roy Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7674)|
| 2:07:59| My wife and one of her aunts were in Roy's house 100 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7679)|
| 2:08:07| Well, maybe not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7687)|
| 2:08:08| I don't know how many years he put back up there that he had been there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7688)|
| 2:08:13| helping Miss Mullins in her household when my wife was in seventh or eighth grade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7693)|
| 2:08:19| or fifth grade or sixth grade, somewhere along in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7699)|
| 2:08:23| Well, I've described Tommy as nepotism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7703)|
| 2:08:27| I'm describing Roy as cronyism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7707)|
| 2:08:33| And I think that I've reacted very well tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7713)|
| 2:08:36| in that I have not expressed any opinions on any of the candidates that are here before us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7716)|
| 2:08:44| And I want you to know that in this upcoming week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7724)|
| 2:08:48| I'll be troubled with what do I need to do at county commission because of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7728)|
| 2:08:58| There lies a little insight into my dilemma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7738)|
| 2:09:03| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7743)|
| 2:09:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7745)|
| 2:09:06| Seeing no other questions or any other people that want to make a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7746)|
| 2:09:13| Now, to the candidates, we will select a candidate on the 22nd, which is 2 o'clock, which is the 22nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7753)|
| 2:09:22| So I would have each one of you to be here for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7762)|
| 2:09:27| Did you have something to say, Mr. Rollins?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7767)|
| 2:09:31| Mr. Chairman, I'm here to advocate and support Deborah Walker Porter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7771)|
| 2:09:39| I've known Deborah for a long time, about 45 years, when she was just a little kid on Selma Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7779)|
| 2:09:47| And when she came to work at the Tennessee Valley Authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7787)|
| 2:09:50| and subsequently the Mechanics Field Community Development Corporation, she's a visionary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7790)|
| 2:09:57| And I listen with intensity with all of these candidates, but I think Deborah is a visionary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7797)|
| 2:10:03| and I think she would be a strong candidate for the school board from the 8th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7803)|
| 2:10:10| And I'm going to say honestly now, I live in the 1st District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7810)|
| 2:10:15| But I know that Deborah would be a strong advocate for the 8th District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7815)|
| 2:10:19| but for all of the students and faculty of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7819)|
| 2:10:24| You know, I got a chance a few minutes ago to see our sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7824)|
| 2:10:31| And it's very interesting, those people that he housed downstairs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7831)|
| 2:10:36| they probably were ill-prepared coming out of the school system to meet the challenge of this new America in which we live in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7836)|
| 2:10:44| And we live in a new America whereby you have to have a license to succeed in most cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7844)|
| 2:10:52| either an academic license or a skill license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7852)|
| 2:10:55| And we need visionaries to prepare our young people for this new America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7855)|
| 2:11:01| If the school system doesn't prepare for this new America, J.J. Jones will prepare them for this new America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7861)|
| 2:11:09| The option is, is to we push hard for a better education system or we expand the penal system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7869)|
| 2:11:18| In the state of Tennessee, we spend something less than $6,000 a year per student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7878)|
| 2:11:25| In the penal system, we spend more than $30,000 a year per prisoner in the penal system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7885)|
| 2:11:31| There's something wrong with that equation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7891)|
| 2:11:33| But again, I think that Deborah is a visionary, and she'll be a strong supporter within the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7893)|
| 2:11:40| And I advocate for her, and she's a fine young lady.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7900)|
| 2:11:43| Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7903)|
| 2:11:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7905)|
| 2:11:48| Did you have something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7908)|
| 2:11:50| Yeah, Chairman, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7910)|
| 2:11:51| I just wanted to thank the commissioners for letting school board members participate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7911)|
| 2:11:55| and also for doing this appointment expeditiously because the board is going to be voting on the capital budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7915)|
| 2:12:04| in the beginning of March, and the operating budget request will come in probably April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7924)|
| 2:12:10| So I think it's important that this seat be filled and the 8th District have full representation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100216dist8schoolboard?start=7930)|
