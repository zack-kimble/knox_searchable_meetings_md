| 2:13:40| This was not to put them on this group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8020)|
| 2:13:43| This was to give the folks on this list the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8023)|
| 2:13:47| Of course, if they refused, then they would not be on this list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8027)|
| 2:13:52| Again, I'm not putting people on a committee without their permission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8032)|
| 2:13:56| What I'm saying is that we extend a hand to these folks and give them the opportunity to serve if they choose to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8036)|
| 2:14:04| not forcing anyone on the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8044)|
| 2:14:06| And if these folks say no or if some of these folks say no, then I'm willing to let things stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8046)|
| 2:14:12| I just think that we should extend the opportunity for some folks with different ideas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8052)|
| 2:14:19| and different backgrounds to serve on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8059)|
| 2:14:21| Some of those folks are here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8061)|
| 2:14:23| I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8063)|
| 2:14:24| I could be asked if I was willing to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8064)|
| 2:14:27| Mr. Smith is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8067)|
| 2:14:28| He could be asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8068)|
| 2:14:29| Bruce Williams is in the audience tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8069)|
| 2:14:33| Some of us are here and could say yes or no to that opportunity as it stands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8073)|
| 2:14:38| and I'm just asking that these folks be given the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8078)|
| 2:14:42| I'm not insisting that they be on it because that would be totally up to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8082)|
| 2:14:46| We have a motion on the floor with an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8086)|
| 2:14:50| Let's not forget that, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8090)|
| 2:14:53| If someone from the prevailing side, Ms. Davis, Mr. Daniels, wants to re-vote my proposal, by Robert's rules of order,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8093)|
| 2:15:02| you do have that opportunity to ask for a re-vote since we are at the same meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8102)|
| 2:15:07| And I would challenge you, I am not demanding that these folks be on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8107)|
| 2:15:11| I'm saying that a welcoming hand be extended to them if they choose to be on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8111)|
| 2:15:18| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8118)|
| 2:15:20| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8120)|
| 2:15:24| I think Mr. Lambert has a point, but if you look at his list of names,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8124)|
| 2:15:30| he's already supposedly classified mine just off the top of his head,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8130)|
| 2:15:37| and I think the MPC is certainly a better judge of qualified candidates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8137)|
| 2:15:46| than maybe some of us who already have positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8146)|
| 2:15:51| And on the issue of, and I didn't call you an extremist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8151)|
| 2:15:58| What I meant to say was that I considered that Mr. Lambert has an extreme set of views,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8158)|
| 2:16:07| especially when it comes to development issues, and if anybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8167)|
| 2:16:11| the people that have been appointed to these positions haven't been here for a couple of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8171)|
| 2:16:18| but if we went back and we looked at the record of votes that Mr. Lambert had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8178)|
| 2:16:26| we would be hard pressed to find an anti-development vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8186)|
| 2:16:30| Every single vote, he votes without exception in favor of a development interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8190)|
| 2:16:38| Now, that is his right, and certainly he makes the point that he's protecting property rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8198)|
| 2:16:44| I am concerned about private property rights as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8204)|
| 2:16:49| And I think that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8209)|
| 2:16:51| Mr. Chairman, I think we need to get back to the motion that we're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8211)|
| 2:16:56| I haven't given up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8216)|
| 2:16:57| I haven't given up the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8217)|
| 2:16:59| I think I have not given up the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8219)|
| 2:17:02| We have gone off of the agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8222)|
| 2:17:04| I've still not given up the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8224)|
| 2:17:07| We'll let him finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8227)|
| 2:17:09| Go ahead, Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8229)|
| 2:17:11| That private property rights are important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8231)|
| 2:17:15| and that those property rights are going to be represented by this task force as it's composed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8235)|
| 2:17:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8243)|
| 2:17:24| Commissioner Luther.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8244)|
| 2:17:26| I just think we're getting off what we're here to discuss and we need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8246)|
| 2:17:31| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8251)|
| 2:17:32| The topic at hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8252)|
| 2:17:35| We have a motion on Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8255)|
| 2:17:38| I just want to check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8258)|
| 2:17:40| If one of the folks that were on the prevailing side asked for a re-vote tonight, can we do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8260)|
| 2:17:47| Of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8267)|
| 2:17:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8268)|
| 2:17:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8269)|
| 2:17:50| I plead with the folks that voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8270)|
| 2:17:52| Again, by the very fact that Mr. Norman acknowledges that my viewpoints are different from his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8272)|
| 2:17:59| and some of these folks on this list, that their viewpoints may be different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8279)|
| 2:18:03| he makes my case for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8283)|
| 2:18:05| This should be a diverse group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8285)|
| 2:18:07| Part of that diversity are viewpoints that Mr. Norman may think are extreme.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8287)|
| 2:18:15| I'm just asking for a seat at the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8295)|
| 2:18:17| I'm not asking to remove anybody else from the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8297)|
| 2:18:20| I'm asking for the opportunity to sit at this table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8300)|
| 2:18:23| and I'm asking to extend a welcoming hand to some of these other folks if they choose to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8303)|
| 2:18:30| I would like to ask if there's someone here that was on the prevailing side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8310)|
| 2:18:35| if you would ask for a re-vote, we can readdress my proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8315)|
| 2:18:41| Commissioner Lambert, I'd be happy to add your name to the list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8321)|
| 2:18:46| if the maker of the motions would accept your name as a friendly amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8326)|
| 2:18:52| if that would satisfy you, and then we could go ahead and move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8332)|
| 2:18:57| Larry, would you like your name to be added as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8337)|
| 2:19:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8341)|
| 2:19:02| I'll accept that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8342)|
| 2:19:03| Mr. Norman, would you be willing to accept that as a friendly amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8343)|
| 2:19:07| So what I'm going to have to accept is that Mr. Lambert is going to be on the committee on this task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8347)|
| 2:19:14| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8354)|
| 2:19:16| That's what I'm asking if you'll accept that as a friendly motion so we can move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8356)|
| 2:19:20| I can't think of anything more torturous than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8360)|
| 2:19:23| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8363)|
| 2:19:26| I understand that, but you will get to, since you are a co-chair of that committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8366)|
| 2:19:31| then you will have the gavel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8371)|
| 2:19:34| Let me suggest that if we are adding Mr. Lambert and Mr. Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8374)|
| 2:19:38| who would lean toward the developer side?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8378)|
| 2:19:40| No, I'm only adding Mr. Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8380)|
| 2:19:43| And further, I would like to add, if we're going to add James Wade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8383)|
| 2:19:47| and we're going to add Commissioner Lambert,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8387)|
| 2:19:49| and we're going to open up this awful can of worms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8389)|
| 2:19:51| I'm going to add Bob Wolfenbarger because Alice Bell Springhill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8391)|
| 2:19:54| That's the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8394)|
| 2:19:56| That's the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8396)|
| 2:19:57| We open up the whole thing and we spend hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8397)|
| 2:19:59| Well, then I'll just withdraw that and we'll go back to just what I've added already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8399)|
| 2:20:03| You've accepted James Wade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8403)|
| 2:20:05| We have a motion on the floor with one amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8405)|
| 2:20:09| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8409)|
| 2:20:11| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8411)|
| 2:20:12| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8412)|
| 2:20:13| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8413)|
| 2:20:14| How many no's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8414)|
| 2:20:17| Two no's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8417)|
| 2:20:19| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8419)|
| 2:20:20| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8420)|
| 2:20:21| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8421)|
| 2:20:22| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8422)|
| 2:20:23| The motion passes with the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8423)|
| 2:20:26| I hope you get that room available tomorrow until 5 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8426)|
| 2:20:30| Chairman, can we take a five-minute recess?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8430)|
| 2:20:37| Mr. Chairman, before we do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8437)|
| 2:20:41| it's my understanding this room is available until 5 p.m. tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8441)|
| 2:20:51| And just for a quick suggestion, we could recess until 9 o'clock tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8451)|
| 2:20:57| I know we've got a lot of people here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8457)|
| 2:20:59| I don't know how many people here would want to go until we went to, what, 1.30 last month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8459)|
| 2:21:07| if they really want to continue to go or if they feel like we could do more justice for the people by staying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8467)|
| 2:21:16| or by coming back at 9 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8476)|
| 2:21:18| It's just a suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8478)|
| 2:21:20| We set a record last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8480)|
| 2:21:21| Let's set another record this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8481)|
| 2:21:23| By golly, let's do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8483)|
| 2:21:25| Marathon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8485)|
| 2:21:26| Just kidding, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8486)|
| 2:21:29| Otherwise, you know, we'll give five-minute recess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8489)|
| 2:21:32| You know, Mr. Lutho, some of us have been here since 9.30 this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8492)|
| 2:21:36| I understand some of us have been here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8496)|
| 2:21:39| Some of us started at 7.30 at the workforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8499)|
| 2:21:41| That's right, but you started on the workforce, but on commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8501)|
| 2:21:43| What I'm talking about, these are supposed to be part-time jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8503)|
| 2:21:47| You were with me this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8507)|
| 2:21:49| At 10 o'clock we had a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8509)|
| 2:21:50| At 2 o'clock we had another meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8510)|
| 2:21:52| Then we had the beer board meeting, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8512)|
| 2:21:57| What's the point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8517)|
| 2:21:59| Until we can't operate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8519)|
| 2:22:03| We need to take five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8523)|
| 2:22:06| Five-minute recess is what he ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=8526)|
| 2:32:02| We're going to start that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9122)|
| 2:32:32| Mr. Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9152)|
| 2:33:02| We're going to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9182)|
| 2:33:32| Could it be 9.16?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9212)|
| 2:33:47| No, 9.16 is to set the meeting schedule for the Knox County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9227)|
| 2:33:53| regular meetings to be 2 o'clock p.m. as the recommended time for the beer board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9233)|
| 2:33:58| 3 p.m. for zonings and 4.30 p.m. for the regular monthly county commission meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9238)|
| 2:34:04| or immediately following zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9244)|
| 2:34:06| This will be effective April 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9246)|
| 2:34:09| Rules committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9249)|
| 2:34:11| This is a recommendation from the rules committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9251)|
| 2:34:14| Take it and discuss it, run with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9254)|
| 2:34:17| What are you going to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9257)|
| 2:34:18| I'll make a motion we approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9258)|
| 2:34:24| Can we get a second on that original motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9264)|
| 2:34:27| I would like to amend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9267)|
| 2:34:30| I would like to amend it to starting like it used to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9270)|
| 2:34:33| because I feel like it would be better for the citizens of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9273)|
| 2:34:37| to start the beer board at 1.30, commission at 2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9277)|
| 2:34:42| and zonings at 6 o'clock after people are off from work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9282)|
| 2:34:47| And the way that always worked before when we started commission meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9287)|
| 2:34:54| we got through before 6, we'd go get something to eat maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9294)|
| 2:34:58| And if we didn't, we would just adjourn and take over the zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9298)|
| 2:35:02| And then as soon as the zonings were over, we'd go back to our meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9302)|
| 2:35:06| You've got to take a press with you to go eat this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9306)|
| 2:35:08| Well, we'll eat a sandwich here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9308)|
| 2:35:10| but I just think that would be better for the citizens than starting these zonings at 4.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9310)|
| 2:35:16| And we have a gentleman here, and I believe he wants to speak on it, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9316)|
| 2:35:20| Now, what was that, a substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9320)|
| 2:35:23| I'd like to make a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9323)|
| 2:35:25| Beer board at 1.30, commission at 2, zonings at 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9325)|
| 2:35:35| And the zoning at 6?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9335)|
| 2:35:36| 6 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9336)|
| 2:35:40| Yeah, we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9340)|
| 2:35:42| Commissioner Pinkston, beer board needs more than 30 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9342)|
| 2:35:45| All right, we'll start at 1 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9345)|
| 2:35:51| Commissioner DeFries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9351)|
| 2:35:52| Can I get a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9352)|
| 2:35:57| Commissioner DeFries, since there's already an amendment pending, you're looking at me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9357)|
| 2:36:02| this is, you do have the possibility right now, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9362)|
| 2:36:06| of discussing an amendment to the meeting of adding, basically changing the zonings to Saturday, if you wish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9366)|
| 2:36:17| That is certainly open to discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9377)|
| 2:36:21| Thank you so much for giving me that advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9381)|
| 2:36:26| I was wanting to know, is there a way, law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9386)|
| 2:36:30| can we just open that up for discussion to see how many people would be available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9390)|
| 2:36:33| and be willing to come on Saturday morning at 10?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9393)|
| 2:36:38| You can certainly make a motion to amend and then proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9398)|
| 2:36:45| Okay, I'll make a motion then at this time to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9405)|
| 2:36:49| We've got a substitute motion, which we can't add another substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9409)|
| 2:36:54| Yeah, you can amend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9414)|
| 2:36:57| Okay, I'll amend that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9417)|
| 2:37:00| To put zonings at 10 o'clock with 1.30 beer board and 2 o'clock county commission meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9420)|
| 2:37:09| and zonings at Saturday at 10 o'clock preceding the ordinary meeting date for county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9429)|
| 2:37:17| She needs a second on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9437)|
| 2:37:25| We've got a person that's checking on the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9445)|
| 2:37:27| She's going to have to have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9447)|
| 2:37:28| She needs a second on her amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9448)|
| 2:37:31| We've got a second on your substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9451)|
| 2:37:35| There's your answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9455)|
| 2:37:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9456)|
| 2:37:37| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9457)|
| 2:37:39| I think they told you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9459)|
| 2:37:45| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9465)|
| 2:37:47| I'd just like to make a comment, is that perhaps we need to have a workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9467)|
| 2:37:51| or a place where we can all get together someday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9471)|
| 2:37:54| and, one, try to determine how we can make things more efficient at this meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9474)|
| 2:37:58| and maybe there determine when we meet rather than us trying to decide here when it's almost midnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9478)|
| 2:38:05| I mean, I guess we'll have to go ahead and vote on those unless those are withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9485)|
| 2:38:09| But I wonder if we just sat down and decided how we really wish to do business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9489)|
| 2:38:13| if there's ways we can be more efficient, maybe get some of this done in committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9493)|
| 2:38:18| And then after we look at that and, more importantly, just to be more fair to the citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9498)|
| 2:38:24| and people who wish to come down here or follow it on television| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9504)|
| 2:38:27| and then decide when we want to have our meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9507)|
| 2:38:32| You know, Commissioner Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9512)|
| 2:38:38| I just really wanted to comment that hopefully that what we can try to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9518)|
| 2:38:42| not with regard to this issue, but all the issues before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9522)|
| 2:38:45| to limit our discussion so that we can get through this meeting this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9525)|
| 2:38:49| especially with some of the things upcoming that we really, you know, time ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9529)|
| 2:38:54| Well, see, that's why I think we need to get together, you know, at some time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9534)|
| 2:38:58| and just have a meeting, hopefully it won't last too long, maybe just a couple of hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9538)|
| 2:39:03| where we decide how we wish to conduct the meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9543)|
| 2:39:06| Well, you know, Mr. Briggs, you're correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9546)|
| 2:39:09| but I think all the older commissioners here will agree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9549)|
| 2:39:12| this is the way we had it probably two or three years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9552)|
| 2:39:16| and it worked better for everybody this way than any way we've had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9556)|
| 2:39:20| We've changed this three times since I've been up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9560)|
| 2:39:22| and now we're looking at changing it four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9562)|
| 2:39:24| And the only way it worked before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9564)|
| 2:39:26| But, anyway, we have a citizen here, I guess we need to yield the floor to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9566)|
| 2:39:29| Yeah, I think Commissioner Pinkson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9569)|
| 2:39:31| and Commissioner Briggs was talking about the length of time that we spend talking about the issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9571)|
| 2:39:37| I believe more so than the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9577)|
| 2:39:40| Well, we're probably going to infringe on some people's rights over there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9580)|
| 2:39:43| if you've got a citizen that really wants to get involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9583)|
| 2:39:46| I'll get with you in one minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9586)|
| 2:39:47| Commissioner Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9587)|
| 2:39:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9590)|
| 2:39:52| Commissioner Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9592)|
| 2:39:53| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9593)|
| 2:39:54| The reason why we're here so long is because now we're discussing everything in public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9594)|
| 2:40:00| after the Sunshine Law trial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9600)|
| 2:40:04| I don't think there's any magic number to the way you can time the meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9604)|
| 2:40:11| that's going to make a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9611)|
| 2:40:13| We've been here, what, nine hours now, those of us who started on beer board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9613)|
| 2:40:18| I don't think it's about when the meetings start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9618)|
| 2:40:21| What I think that we need to consider is we need to have the zoning meeting on a different day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9621)|
| 2:40:27| Now, I'm not for Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9627)|
| 2:40:29| I don't think Saturday at 10 in the morning is a good idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9629)|
| 2:40:32| but I think that's, well, yeah, honestly, that's about the best day to sell automobiles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9632)|
| 2:40:39| and that's my business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9639)|
| 2:40:41| Not that I think I still have a used car lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9641)|
| 2:40:44| I drove by it the other day, and it looked like it was still there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9644)|
| 2:40:47| See, that's bringing on more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9647)|
| 2:40:51| Well, but what I'm saying is we need to have the zonings on a different day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9651)|
| 2:40:58| It just doesn't need to be Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9658)|
| 2:41:03| Are you Carson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9663)|
| 2:41:04| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9664)|
| 2:41:05| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9665)|
| 2:41:06| Thank you, commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9666)|
| 2:41:07| I need your address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9667)|
| 2:41:08| Carson Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9668)|
| 2:41:09| Carson Daly, 7508 Government Farm Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9669)|
| 2:41:13| Real quickly, no long statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9673)|
| 2:41:16| When you change these zonings, please keep us citizens in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9676)|
| 2:41:20| It's hard for someone to get off at 3 o'clock in the afternoon to come to these zoning meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9680)|
| 2:41:26| and these issues are important to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9686)|
| 2:41:28| They really, really are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9688)|
| 2:41:30| All these issues are important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9690)|
| 2:41:31| But please do not stick these zoning issues at 3 o'clock in the afternoon where people cannot come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9691)|
| 2:41:39| I'm begging you not to do that, all right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9699)|
| 2:41:42| Commissioner, I mean, Carson, you've been up here several times in front of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9702)|
| 2:41:46| You used to come at 6 o'clock and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9706)|
| 2:41:48| What do you think about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9708)|
| 2:41:50| Six o'clock would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9710)|
| 2:41:52| Hey, Saturday would be even better because you all can talk after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9712)|
| 2:41:56| You all can talk your open sunshine law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9716)|
| 2:41:58| You can talk about anything because you're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9718)|
| 2:42:00| But, no, I'm just kidding, on Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9720)|
| 2:42:03| I would be here on Saturday, believe me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9723)|
| 2:42:05| But it did work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9725)|
| 2:42:06| Six o'clock worked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9726)|
| 2:42:07| They took a break and did the zonings, and they went well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9727)|
| 2:42:13| And you won't be here as long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9733)|
| 2:42:15| It never was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9735)|
| 2:42:16| You're setting records because of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9736)|
| 2:42:19| I think Dr. Briggs said the way things are set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9739)|
| 2:42:22| And the old way did work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9742)|
| 2:42:25| But if you change it, please do not change rezonings to where the average citizen must be waters here, can get here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9745)|
| 2:42:36| And please, that's all I'm asking you to do that, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9756)|
| 2:42:42| We have a motion on Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9762)|
| 2:42:47| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9767)|
| 2:42:48| Oh, if I'm not mistaken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9768)|
| 2:42:53| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9773)|
| 2:42:54| I was just going to ask, what was your motion again, Mr. Pinkston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9774)|
| 2:42:56| It was beer board at one, commission at two, zoning start at six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9776)|
| 2:43:05| Now, we've had some lengthy discussions before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9785)|
| 2:43:07| You remember the Kern Farm out there, but we've never been tied up like this late disrupting these citizens and things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9787)|
| 2:43:13| That's the best deal that we've had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9793)|
| 2:43:15| And it's been changed three times since I've been here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9795)|
| 2:43:20| Does everyone understand the substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9800)|
| 2:43:24| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9804)|
| 2:43:25| Should that be sent to the rules committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9805)|
| 2:43:27| Oh, we're making it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9807)|
| 2:43:28| Oh, we're making it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9808)|
| 2:43:30| Y'all came back with some bad, bad rules on where to change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9810)|
| 2:43:37| In front of the public, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9817)|
| 2:43:39| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9819)|
| 2:43:41| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9821)|
| 2:43:42| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9822)|
| 2:43:43| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9823)|
| 2:43:44| It was no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9824)|
| 2:43:49| One no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9829)|
| 2:43:50| It needs to be here every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9830)|
| 2:43:52| You can't cram all this stuff in one day and us not be here until midnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9832)|
| 2:43:56| Mr. Chair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9836)|
| 2:43:59| I really do think that we probably need a workshop on changing how we do our meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9839)|
| 2:44:05| But we'll see how this works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9845)|
| 2:44:09| I guess in the month of April it will be one, one o'clock billboard, two o'clock commission, and six o'clock zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9849)|
| 2:44:19| It starts in April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9859)|
| 2:44:22| Next one, clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9862)|
| 2:44:26| Resolution 917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9866)|
| 2:44:28| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9868)|
| 2:44:30| Request that the Knox County Mayor pursue it to the Knox County Charter, create a charter review committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9870)|
| 2:44:37| Finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9877)|
| 2:44:43| Finance 10-0 approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9883)|
| 2:44:46| This.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9886)|
| 2:44:48| Can I comment now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9888)|
| 2:44:50| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9890)|
| 2:44:52| I ask that this amendment be withdrawn because the mayor has already appointed a commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9892)|
| 2:44:58| It really doesn't have any relevance now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9898)|
| 2:45:03| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9903)|
| 2:45:04| It does, too, because what you should be considering, Commissioner, is the proclamation that's been brought before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9904)|
| 2:45:12| We don't have one yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9912)|
| 2:45:15| Right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9915)|
| 2:45:16| We don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9916)|
| 2:45:19| I mean, we can consider the proclamation, but we don't need to consider the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9919)|
| 2:45:27| Well, the resolution is mentioned in the proclamation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9927)|
| 2:45:30| Basically, the proclamation anticipates that there's a resolution to be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9930)|
| 2:45:35| If you don't approve of the resolution, we assume that you will not approve of the charter review committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9935)|
| 2:45:40| Therefore, you would not ratify the mayor's proclamation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9940)|
| 2:45:45| So, really, it is all part of the same process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9945)|
| 2:45:57| Is it a simple majority?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9957)|
| 2:45:59| Simple majority vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9959)|
| 2:46:02| Would you like me to comment on that, then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9962)|
| 2:46:05| The resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9965)|
| 2:46:08| The reason this resolution was proposed is that the amendment process was going very rapidly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9968)|
| 2:46:15| And, in my opinion, the amendments that we considered at the last meeting that passed on the first reading both had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9975)|
| 2:46:23| I think the process had flaws and I think that the amendment had flaws also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9983)|
| 2:46:27| And when we're considering something so important and so profound and so long-lasting as having amendments that are going to be added to our charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9987)|
| 2:46:36| we have to be very careful that the amendments aren't flawed because, as we've mentioned before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=9996)|
| 2:46:42| they can have unintended consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10002)|
| 2:46:47| And one of the reasons that we can have a committee like this is that part of our responsibilities as elected officials is to be certain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10007)|
| 2:46:55| that we do not allow flawed amendments or amendments that has unclear wording to even be put before the public to vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10015)|
| 2:47:03| They depend on us to put the best amendments forward and then they can vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10023)|
| 2:47:07| And I'm not making any comments on the merits of any of the amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10027)|
| 2:47:10| but I just want to make comments that we need to be certain that both legally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10030)|
| 2:47:15| and in a fashion that the average citizen can understand they know exactly what they're voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10035)|
| 2:47:22| We really have several choices here because the Charter Petition Committee says they're going to go through the petition process on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10042)|
| 2:47:32| I think if we abrogate our responsibilities and say let them go ahead with the petition process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10052)|
| 2:47:38| there's several very negative aspects to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10058)|
| 2:47:41| First of all, they're writing the amendments, they're setting the agenda, and they're going to go through the petition process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10061)|
| 2:47:48| I called Greg McKay at the Election Commission today and I asked him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10068)|
| 2:47:52| how much does it cost the county when a petition is submitted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10072)|
| 2:47:56| And he says it's approximately one dollar per signature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10076)|
| 2:48:01| For one amendment, it would cost the county $40,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10081)|
| 2:48:05| If they put eight amendments on there, you're talking $320,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10085)|
| 2:48:09| That's nearly ten times what we're even discussing in the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10089)|
| 2:48:14| Plus, if they go through with the process, there's no input from any elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10094)|
| 2:48:20| If we approve this Charter Review Committee, all the amendments will be discussed in public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10100)|
| 2:48:27| because it falls under the Open Meetings Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10107)|
| 2:48:30| We'll have public participation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10110)|
| 2:48:32| We'll have this commission represented by nine members, one from each district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10112)|
| 2:48:38| And to me, it seems like it's probably the best and most democratic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10118)|
| 2:48:41| and the most accurate way to get amendments on the ballot that are clear, concise, and don't have any ambiguities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10121)|
| 2:48:55| Commissioner Roundtree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10135)|
| 2:48:57| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10137)|
| 2:49:01| I don't usually have a lot to say at these meetings, but I do tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10141)|
| 2:49:04| And I think what you're about to hear is me thinking outside the box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10144)|
| 2:49:11| So here goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10151)|
| 2:49:13| If I can still read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10153)|
| 2:49:14| I only wrote this seven or eight hours ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10154)|
| 2:49:22| First of all, I want to thank everybody that came out to Powell on Saturday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10162)|
| 2:49:26| to Commissioner Lambert's and I's public forum there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10166)|
| 2:49:30| We had 50 people there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10170)|
| 2:49:32| The room was packed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10172)|
| 2:49:33| We had a lively discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10173)|
| 2:49:35| And I really appreciate all you commissioners coming to support us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10175)|
| 2:49:42| Over the past three weeks, I've seen a willingness from all parties involved in the charter petition drive effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10182)|
| 2:49:51| The commission, the Knox Charter Petition Group, and most importantly, the citizens of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10191)|
| 2:49:58| to work together regarding the proposed changes to our Knox County Charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10198)|
| 2:50:05| This spirit of cooperation and the willingness of certain parties, I'm having trouble reading this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10205)|
| 2:50:18| to look at and compromise tells me that something right is going on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10218)|
| 2:50:24| I strongly support some of the proposed changes to our charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10224)|
| 2:50:29| I strongly oppose some of the original changes proposed by the Knox Charter Petition Group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10229)|
| 2:50:36| But as time has moved forward, the citizens of Knox County and the Knox County Commission has been listened to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10236)|
| 2:50:46| There is already effective change and that change continues to evolve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10246)|
| 2:50:52| The limiting factor that hinders this process from continuing to grow are the dates of August the 5th, 2008,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10252)|
| 2:51:00| and November the 4th, 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10260)|
| 2:51:04| It would appear to me that these dates cloud everyone's visions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10264)|
| 2:51:09| and are only target dates that should not slow down the process that is ongoing now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10269)|
| 2:51:27| And the dates are only dates on a calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10287)|
| 2:51:31| The most important date we need to be concerned with is the next election date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10291)|
| 2:51:37| following a careful, well-thought-out process which is now in the works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10297)|
| 2:51:44| It is very disturbing to me that this apparent rush to judgment can and will likely stop the good work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10304)|
| 2:51:51| that has occurred so far and can continue to occur if we leave it alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10311)|
| 2:51:58| I am not convinced that an appointed charter reunion committee is our answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10318)|
| 2:52:04| I was not comfortable with the Knox Charter Petition's initial proposals we heard last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10324)|
| 2:52:10| I am comfortable with giving the process now in place and working a chance to move forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10330)|
| 2:52:17| even if that takes a year or more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10337)|
| 2:52:20| Now is our best opportunity to get this right the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10340)|
| 2:52:27| I urge each of you to carefully consider my observations as seen through my eyes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10347)|
| 2:52:34| and ask yourself, if this is now working, why do we need to change it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10354)|
| 2:52:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10359)|
| 2:52:52| Mr. Chairman, I want to remind everybody of my admission of my transgression of the Sunshine Law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10372)|
| 2:53:03| as I stated earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10383)|
| 2:53:05| What I stated was true and only involved a conversation that I had with Commissioner Lambert| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10385)|
| 2:53:12| regarding my offer to participate on the Charter Review Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10392)|
| 2:53:21| Commissioner Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10401)|
| 2:53:25| I'm not used to getting to speak so quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10405)|
| 2:53:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10407)|
| 2:53:28| Just a couple of things with regard to this review committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10408)|
| 2:53:34| One of the concerns I have about this is that five of the commissioners are new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10414)|
| 2:53:40| And so I think that we don't bring institutional knowledge to that review committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10420)|
| 2:53:46| and that's a real concern for me considering that our charter is so important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10426)|
| 2:53:53| The other thing that I have with regard to this is kind of has to do with accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10433)|
| 2:54:00| As commissioners, if someone's dissatisfied with our performance, they can vote us out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10440)|
| 2:54:06| As citizens, there's no accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10446)|
| 2:54:10| These 18 citizens are given a vote as to how to amend our charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10450)|
| 2:54:18| but there's no way for other citizens in this community to redress them other than just their opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10458)|
| 2:54:26| You can come and participate in the process, but you don't have a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10466)|
| 2:54:32| But these 18 do, and these 18 citizens are going to control the terminology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10472)|
| 2:54:38| and the language of our charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10478)|
| 2:54:41| That's a real concern for me because there's no correlation as to how they vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10481)|
| 2:54:47| They're not taking an oath to anyone in this community other than just stepping forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10487)|
| 2:54:52| and saying that they'll volunteer, whereas elected officials, you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10492)|
| 2:54:57| You take an oath to protect the charter and to represent your community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10497)|
| 2:55:02| and I don't see that with just the 18 citizens, and that's a real concern for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10502)|
| 2:55:09| So I'm not in favor of the charter review committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10509)|
| 2:55:15| Oh, the other thing was has early voting been factored into the 90-45 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10515)|
| 2:55:22| Because we have been talking about, you know, trying to get this on the August ballot, that that was a rush.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10522)|
| 2:55:28| Well, has early voting been factored into that timeline?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10528)|
| 2:55:39| Commissioner, what the law provides is, what our charter provides is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10539)|
| 2:55:44| that the charter review committee must submit their recommendations for changing the charter to the election commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10544)|
| 2:56:03| more than 45 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10563)|
| 2:56:06| Basically, let's see, they've got to submit it 45 days prior to, if I'm reading this correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10566)|
| 2:56:13| 45 days prior to the election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10573)|
| 2:56:18| It seems like they send out ballots to the military about 45 days prior to the election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10578)|
| 2:56:27| It all has to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10587)|
| 2:56:29| It has to happen very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10589)|
| 2:56:36| What you're looking at right now is basically, if the committee is instituted today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10596)|
| 2:56:45| then they've got about 91 days to complete their work and get their result to the county election commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10605)|
| 2:56:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10612)|
| 2:56:53| Well, our early voting would take place after that, and they would have the opportunity to vote on the amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10613)|
| 2:57:00| But the 45 days, her point is, the 45 days, it would be August 5th, not when the early voting starts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10620)|
| 2:57:08| Forty-five days this side of August 7th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10628)|
| 2:57:11| Or whatever the August date is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10631)|
| 2:57:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10634)|
| 2:57:16| Between 45 and 60 days prior to the election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10636)|
| 2:57:19| the charter review committee must submit its amendments to the county election commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10639)|
| 2:57:25| for proper consideration on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10645)|
| 2:57:33| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10653)|
| 2:57:36| I agree with Commissioner Roundtree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10656)|
| 2:57:43| Why the rush?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10663)|
| 2:57:44| I think you made some very astute observations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10664)|
| 2:57:47| I think this commission has responded to many of the concerns that we heard over the past year with our new policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10667)|
| 2:58:03| I think we are moving in a very good direction, as he has stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10683)|
| 2:58:08| with trying to figure out what this county would like to look like as far as its government is concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10688)|
| 2:58:20| Once we put these new amendments, whatever passes, they're going to be there for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10700)|
| 2:58:30| I would rather side on caution in making sure we do it right the first time, as Commissioner Roundtree suggested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10710)|
| 2:58:44| And I also agree with Commissioner Briggs that I have concerns, grave concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10724)|
| 2:58:54| about some of the amendments that the petition group came forward with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10734)|
| 2:59:01| And although some of them I agree with, some of them I oppose to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10741)|
| 2:59:07| but I really think, you know, why the rush?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10747)|
| 2:59:11| And I think we can do our citizens a better job if we were to wait until after the election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10751)|
| 2:59:23| that we're going to have here in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10763)|
| 2:59:25| We're going to know who some of the commissioners are going to be that will be elected at that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10765)|
| 2:59:31| and we'll have some commissioners going off and let that new commission have its input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10771)|
| 2:59:39| because they're the ones that are going to be sitting in office for two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10779)|
| 2:59:43| whereas, you know, some of these commissioners now, although they're serving with very distinguished,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10783)|
| 2:59:53| I do think it is that we should wait until we're elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart3?start=10793)|
