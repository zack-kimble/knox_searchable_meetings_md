| 0:00:00| Go ahead, you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=0)|
| 0:00:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3)|
| 0:00:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4)|
| 0:00:05| Or less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5)|
| 0:00:06| I got you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6)|
| 0:00:08| Chairman Strickland and County Commissioners, my name is Lillian Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8)|
| 0:00:12| I live in the 7th District at 1719 Greenwell Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=12)|
| 0:00:17| I want to appreciate the opportunity to address my qualifications and desire to serve as County Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=17)|
| 0:00:22| for the 7th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=22)|
| 0:00:26| I have extensive management skills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=26)|
| 0:00:28| I've been involved in budget and tax preparations, all phases of accounting, personnel management,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=28)|
| 0:00:34| as well as all duties and responsibilities required to build a successful business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=34)|
| 0:00:42| I feel that my experience as a businesswoman has helped prepare me for many of the issues that will be brought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=42)|
| 0:00:47| before commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=47)|
| 0:00:50| I've been in attendance at these County Commission meetings now for the past two and a half years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=50)|
| 0:00:55| and I am familiar with many of the challenges that this body has to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=55)|
| 0:01:02| In the past year, there have been several items that have been in the forefront that has had my concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=62)|
| 0:01:08| one of which the Hillcrest Nursing Facility, the Intake Center, the budget, and now the upcoming budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=68)|
| 0:01:18| These are just kind of some things that I just wanted to mention just kind of off the top of my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=78)|
| 0:01:23| I think for now, the Hillcrest issue is probably off of the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=83)|
| 0:01:28| The Intake Center, I feel, is going to require a lot of research with thoughtful and serious consideration from all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=88)|
| 0:01:35| parties involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=95)|
| 0:01:39| The most important issue I feel that is facing all of Knox County is this upcoming budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=99)|
| 0:01:48| I tend to agree with Mr. Vanderveet's statement on the Intake Center that it really may need to be a part of the budget in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=108)|
| 0:01:55| the capital improvement plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=115)|
| 0:01:59| I can work with Mr. Ragsdale, Mr. Troyer, and, of course, this commission to study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=119)|
| 0:02:04| and help bring about a budget and a capital improvement plan that the citizens of Knox County can understand and afford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=124)|
| 0:02:15| I've been involved in the decision-making not only for business matters but for community endeavors as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=135)|
| 0:02:23| While serving as chair of the beautification committee with the Powell Business and Professional Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=143)|
| 0:02:29| I had the opportunity to work with one of Mayor Ragsdale's staff, Mr. Grant Rosenberg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=149)|
| 0:02:36| With the help of the mayor's office, I was able to secure the --" I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=156)|
| 0:02:41| I was able to secure from the state of Tennessee a $20,000 grant to improve the landscaping at the I-75 Emory Road Interchange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=161)|
| 0:02:51| Now, this was through a state program called the Gateway to Communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=171)|
| 0:02:56| And if I could take just another moment, I'd like to tell you just a little bit about our teen driving awareness program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=176)|
| 0:03:04| In the period between 1996 and 2006, our community had lost 13 young adults to automobile-related accidents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=184)|
| 0:03:14| In 2004, we developed a program through the Powell Business and Professional Association along with Powell High School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=194)|
| 0:03:23| and we called it the Teen Driving Awareness Program that we used to address this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=203)|
| 0:03:30| We had a serious issue before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=210)|
| 0:03:34| We formed a committee of which I was a part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=214)|
| 0:03:37| We created a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=217)|
| 0:03:40| We partnershiped with the business communities to make it all happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=220)|
| 0:03:45| Now, I've been involved in the Teen Driving Awareness Program with Powell High School since its inception four years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=225)|
| 0:03:53| and we are seeing that this program is working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=233)|
| 0:03:57| From 13 fatalities prior to this program started in 2004 to only three since,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=237)|
| 0:04:05| of course, we all realize that one is too many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=245)|
| 0:04:08| But I think this demonstrates the power and the positive result of people working together for the common cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=248)|
| 0:04:18| Through our efforts, we were able to obtain a $60,000 grant from the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=258)|
| 0:04:26| to give us the opportunity to make available to every school district in Tennessee a CD copy of this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=266)|
| 0:04:34| Our goal is to try to take it nationwide in the near future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=274)|
| 0:04:40| On January the 22nd, now this is just something I've been told and I wanted to relate to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=280)|
| 0:04:46| On January the 22nd at 6 o'clock p.m. at the Powell High School, there will be a premier showing of this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=286)|
| 0:04:55| It's my understanding that every commissioner will be receiving an invitation to this event from the Governor's Highway Safety Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=295)|
| 0:05:02| You have one minute, Mrs. Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=302)|
| 0:05:05| So if you all can take the time to please attend that event, you will find it to be a very eye-opening event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=305)|
| 0:05:15| And I think that this program needs to be at every high school in your district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=315)|
| 0:05:22| I feel this same course of action with citizens and commissioners working together can help resolve many of these issues that Knox County is facing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=322)|
| 0:05:32| It is my desire to serve the citizens of the 7th District and Knox County in the same manner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=332)|
| 0:05:39| by taking the issue that is before us, addressing it with a positive attitude and an open mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=339)|
| 0:05:46| doing the research and helping to bring forth a solution for the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=346)|
| 0:05:53| My door is always open to my community, both business and personal, to discuss any concerns or ideas that they may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=353)|
| 0:06:02| They realize that I've always been a willing partner and a voice for any worthwhile project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=362)|
| 0:06:07| or endeavor that we decide is feasible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=367)|
| 0:06:10| It's your turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=370)|
| 0:06:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=371)|
| 0:06:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=372)|
| 0:06:15| If I'm fortunate enough to be appointed to this position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=375)|
| 0:06:19| this will be my formula slash criteria for ensuring the citizens of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=379)|
| 0:06:25| that I will represent them to the best of my ability and I will serve with dignity and honesty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=385)|
| 0:06:33| I know we have questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=393)|
| 0:06:36| Commissioner Smith, did you want to start out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=396)|
| 0:06:40| Well, the question is I was going to let all of them speak and say why they want to run for county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=400)|
| 0:06:44| and then I was going to have a list of questions, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=404)|
| 0:06:47| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=407)|
| 0:06:49| Ms. Williams, you're right on the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=409)|
| 0:06:52| This is going to be a very, very difficult time coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=412)|
| 0:06:55| But I also wanted to ask you about specific projects there in the district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=415)|
| 0:06:59| and I commend you for being involved and being involved in the team driving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=419)|
| 0:07:03| But are there specific things that are 7th District specific that you would like to see worked on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=423)|
| 0:07:09| and perhaps accomplished over the next 18 months or so that perhaps you would be in office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=429)|
| 0:07:15| Well, there's one thing I am very interested in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=435)|
| 0:07:18| and that is the project out in halls concerning the park that we're trying to get online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=438)|
| 0:07:26| Now, it's my understanding that that's one of the ideas that Larry has been working on as well as Scott,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=446)|
| 0:07:34| and I would like to see those projects carried through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=454)|
| 0:07:38| This is going to be a tough decision, I think, just looking at the resumes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=458)|
| 0:07:41| And I know some of the folks briefly, some of the folks I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=461)|
| 0:07:44| but why should you receive this appointment as opposed to any of these other folks that are going to be speaking today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=464)|
| 0:07:52| What is it about Lillian Williams that you would want us to know that would be the reason we should vote for you for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=472)|
| 0:08:01| appointment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=481)|
| 0:08:03| Well, I feel a little bit hesitant to say something that you would choose me over someone else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=483)|
| 0:08:09| because a lot of these people are my friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=489)|
| 0:08:11| I know them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=491)|
| 0:08:12| But I will say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=492)|
| 0:08:15| I have no agenda except for serving the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=495)|
| 0:08:21| I don't need a job, and I just want to do what is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=501)|
| 0:08:26| I have the time to do the research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=506)|
| 0:08:29| I have the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=509)|
| 0:08:30| I'm always available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=510)|
| 0:08:32| I really and truly care about my county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=512)|
| 0:08:35| I am so fortunate, as all of us are, to be able to live in this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=515)|
| 0:08:39| And if I can be of any help, I'm willing to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=519)|
| 0:08:42| My last question, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=522)|
| 0:08:44| Are there any conflicts at all, any conflicts of interest at all that you see that would prevent you from serving on this body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=524)|
| 0:08:52| No, I really don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=532)|
| 0:08:53| I feel like I'm a very open-minded person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=533)|
| 0:08:56| I can make decisions regardless of who is involved or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=536)|
| 0:09:01| My agenda for this appointment or nomination or whatever we're calling it tonight is I want to help Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=541)|
| 0:09:11| Whatever it takes, as long as it's the right thing to do, I'm willing to work with anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=551)|
| 0:09:19| So that's really my agenda is to do what I can for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=559)|
| 0:09:26| Commissioner Lupo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=566)|
| 0:09:27| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=567)|
| 0:09:27| I'm going to ask this question of all of the candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=567)|
| 0:09:34| Scott Moore has appealed the decision of the chancellor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=574)|
| 0:09:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=578)|
| 0:09:39| And it's my understanding that if he is successful in his appeal, he will be reinstated into this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=579)|
| 0:09:52| And whoever this person that gets appointed will have to immediately be out of this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=592)|
| 0:10:01| Will you in any way fight that or will you step aside gracefully if Commissioner Moore's appeal is successful?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=601)|
| 0:10:16| I do understand that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=616)|
| 0:10:18| And if Scott does win his appeal, I will gladly step aside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=618)|
| 0:10:22| But I will say this, I will continue to work and support the programs and the legislation that it takes to make Knox County a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=622)|
| 0:10:32| better community for all of us to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=632)|
| 0:10:34| But I will gladly step aside for Scott to take his seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=634)|
| 0:10:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=637)|
| 0:10:38| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=638)|
| 0:10:39| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=639)|
| 0:10:41| I have a question also that I'm going to be asking some of these candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=641)|
| 0:10:45| And one of the answers is yes, no, or maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=645)|
| 0:10:50| As you know, the commission is being reduced from 19 to 11 members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=650)|
| 0:10:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=655)|
| 0:10:56| And do you have any intentions or ideas about what you would do in two years when your term is up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=656)|
| 0:11:01| and then we have another election?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=661)|
| 0:11:03| Would you intend to run?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=663)|
| 0:11:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=665)|
| 0:11:06| Definitely not run or maybe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=666)|
| 0:11:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=669)|
| 0:11:10| If God gives me the health, yes, I will run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=670)|
| 0:11:13| Another question that we probably need to ask all the candidates, are there any arrests?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=673)|
| 0:11:18| Have you paid your taxes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=678)|
| 0:11:20| Anything that sometimes it would reflect negatively on the commission that we probably should know about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=680)|
| 0:11:26| To my knowledge, there is none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=686)|
| 0:11:29| And finally, this is a policy question that's come up frequently at this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=689)|
| 0:11:34| and it deals with the tax incentive financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=694)|
| 0:11:38| And I'm asking this question because there is an issue that's coming up, as you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=698)|
| 0:11:43| out in the 7th District on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=703)|
| 0:11:45| And it's almost a philosophical question on how we use the TIFs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=705)|
| 0:11:50| whether they should just be reserved for developing the blighted areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=710)|
| 0:11:54| or is this something that we should be using elsewhere in the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=714)|
| 0:11:57| And you don't have to address specifically what's occurring out in halls with that development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=717)|
| 0:12:03| but I would just like to know what your philosophy is regarding the TIFs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=723)|
| 0:12:07| I think every TIF has to be judged on its own merits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=727)|
| 0:12:13| We need to do the research on every one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=733)|
| 0:12:16| Some of them are good, but some of them are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=736)|
| 0:12:19| So I feel like that you judge them on their merits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=739)|
| 0:12:26| Commissioner Mark Harmon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=746)|
| 0:12:30| Would you ask for and expect to serve if appointed on the committee known as the Board of Zoning Appeals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=750)|
| 0:12:37| I would be delighted to serve on any board that they would ask me to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=757)|
| 0:12:41| Mm-hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=761)|
| 0:12:46| Commissioner Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=766)|
| 0:12:48| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=768)|
| 0:12:49| Ms. Williams, when we sit up here, we have a lot of people watching us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=769)|
| 0:12:55| But it's also interesting for us to watch you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=775)|
| 0:12:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=778)|
| 0:12:59| And I guess in the two years that I've been up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=779)|
| 0:13:04| there's probably been nobody that I can remember that's been to meetings more frequently than you have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=784)|
| 0:13:11| you and your husband.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=791)|
| 0:13:13| So we see you often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=793)|
| 0:13:17| Can you talk about that a little bit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=797)|
| 0:13:19| Why do you come so much?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=799)|
| 0:13:21| Why are you here so often?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=801)|
| 0:13:25| I guess respond to that first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=805)|
| 0:13:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=807)|
| 0:13:29| It's been probably about three or three-and-a-half years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=809)|
| 0:13:35| I kind of started thinking that maybe I wanted to run for commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=815)|
| 0:13:40| And I knew before I did that I needed to have some kind of a background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=820)|
| 0:13:44| I needed to put together how the system works and that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=824)|
| 0:13:50| So I just started coming to the meetings and trying to learn as much as I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=830)|
| 0:13:54| And I feel like now that, not that I am, I'm not a rocket scientist and I don't pretend to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=834)|
| 0:14:01| but I have a good grasp on the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=841)|
| 0:14:06| And I would be delighted to have this appointment if it comes to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=846)|
| 0:14:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=851)|
| 0:14:12| And then my only other question is, is there anybody that's on this commission that you have any special relationship with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=852)|
| 0:14:21| No, I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=861)|
| 0:14:23| No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=863)|
| 0:14:25| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=865)|
| 0:14:26| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=866)|
| 0:14:28| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=868)|
| 0:14:33| Lillian, I thought we were going to go and ask everybody at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=873)|
| 0:14:36| So I've got a whole list of questions that I want to ask, so I don't feel like I'm drilling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=876)|
| 0:14:41| And you've answered some of them, so give me a chance to go through some of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=881)|
| 0:14:44| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=884)|
| 0:14:47| What would be your personal goal for the 7th District in the 20-something months that you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=887)|
| 0:14:52| Any personal goals that you would set?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=892)|
| 0:14:56| Well, my personal goals would just, number one, would be to continue on the issues that you all are now dealing with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=896)|
| 0:15:02| and to learn about those and do whatever I can to make them come about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=902)|
| 0:15:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=907)|
| 0:15:08| And you are very active in the community, so I will skip that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=908)|
| 0:15:12| What's your biggest asset that you bring to the seat?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=912)|
| 0:15:18| Well, as my resume reflects, I'm certainly qualified as far as the business area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=918)|
| 0:15:23| Like I said, I've dealt with budgets and tax preparations and that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=923)|
| 0:15:28| I am a very personable or I feel like I'm a very personable person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=928)|
| 0:15:32| I think all of the people in my district would find me very easy to talk to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=932)|
| 0:15:38| They've never had any problem with it in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=938)|
| 0:15:42| But I guess my real goal is, it's like what I said a while ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=942)|
| 0:15:47| I just want what's best for the people of the 7th District as well as all of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=947)|
| 0:15:53| Whatever I can do to contribute to whatever is going on at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=953)|
| 0:15:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=958)|
| 0:15:59| What experience do you have with budgets and how big were those budgets?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=959)|
| 0:16:02| Well, I think as my resume reflects, I think I've had about as far as the number of the dollar amount of the budgets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=962)|
| 0:16:10| I don't really know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=970)|
| 0:16:11| I would say probably between two and say maybe two and five million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=971)|
| 0:16:17| I have always run the businesses that Bruce and I have grown from the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=977)|
| 0:16:22| I've always run the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=982)|
| 0:16:24| I've always been involved in all of the duties and the responsibilities to make a business successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=984)|
| 0:16:31| And what experience do you have, if any, with zonings and zoning issues, commercial and or residential?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=991)|
| 0:16:37| As far as the actual zonings, that was not my field as far as going to get the permits and knowing all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=997)|
| 0:16:43| But I have learned some of the, I guess, what goes on in the zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1003)|
| 0:16:51| But I'm a quick learner and I'll be willing to do my homework on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1011)|
| 0:16:56| Being on commission, a lot of times you'll be assigned to several committees, probably four to six committees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1016)|
| 0:17:02| and they meet 10 o'clock, 8 o'clock in the morning, just different times and some at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1022)|
| 0:17:06| Will you be able to attend those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1026)|
| 0:17:09| I'm available any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1029)|
| 0:17:12| I've checked everybody's voting records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1032)|
| 0:17:13| Everybody, everybody, they all vote and everybody's taxes are paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1033)|
| 0:17:16| Everybody's paid up on their taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1036)|
| 0:17:18| So that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1038)|
| 0:17:19| You know, and people out there in the audience, forgive us for some of the questions that we got to ask you tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1039)|
| 0:17:24| But in the past, we've been burned on some stuff because we didn't do complete homework on some things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1044)|
| 0:17:29| So that's why we're going to ask some of these questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1049)|
| 0:17:33| Will you vote on every issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1053)|
| 0:17:37| If I am not familiar enough with an issue, if I have not done my research, if I don't understand what's going on, no, I won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1057)|
| 0:17:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1074)|
| 0:18:00| And you said you have no conflicts or no relation to anybody in the courthouse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1080)|
| 0:18:04| Anything there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1084)|
| 0:18:06| You mean people that work at the courthouse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1086)|
| 0:18:07| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1087)|
| 0:18:08| Any immediate family members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1088)|
| 0:18:09| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1089)|
| 0:18:10| No, I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1090)|
| 0:18:11| And I know the answers, but I'm getting it out there, Lillian, so everybody else, we're putting it out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1091)|
| 0:18:16| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1096)|
| 0:18:17| Not a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1097)|
| 0:18:19| One question that I've got, and I see a conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1099)|
| 0:18:23| Do you not have a lawsuit against the mayor at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1103)|
| 0:18:27| Actually, on that, it's the Astor suit that 10 or 12 of us citizens had filed against the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1107)|
| 0:18:35| I'm kind of glad you brought that up, Larry, because really and truly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1115)|
| 0:18:39| this is not a personal thing with the mayor and these people that signed that suit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1119)|
| 0:18:45| It is not personal at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1125)|
| 0:18:47| We're all concerned about how Knox County is being looked upon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1127)|
| 0:18:57| I wish nothing but the best for Mayor Ragsdale and his staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1137)|
| 0:19:02| But as a business owner and being the head of a company, and in this case the county, I feel like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1142)|
| 0:19:12| now, I don't know where the downfall was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1152)|
| 0:19:14| I just don't feel like that things were done properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1154)|
| 0:19:17| And what I did, I did because I felt it was the right thing to do, and it was the right thing for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1157)|
| 0:19:24| Now, at this point, this is out of my hands completely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1164)|
| 0:19:29| I do feel that when we took our complaints to the DA, if we had not had enough information for them to deal with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1169)|
| 0:19:41| they would have asked us to just leave that, you know, you're wasting our time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1181)|
| 0:19:46| But evidently, we did have enough because they took the case on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1186)|
| 0:19:51| And now it is up to the courts and it is completely out of my hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1191)|
| 0:19:55| But what I did, I want everybody to understand, it was not anything personal against Mayor Ragsdale himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1195)|
| 0:20:02| I'm concerned about Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1202)|
| 0:20:05| And I don't care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1205)|
| 0:20:06| That is your perfect right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1206)|
| 0:20:07| If you want to do that, that is your right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1207)|
| 0:20:10| But do you not, if you were going to TVA or University of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1210)|
| 0:20:14| and you had a lawsuit against TVA or University of Tennessee, would you not, how would you think they would look upon you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1214)|
| 0:20:19| and hiring you in that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1219)|
| 0:20:20| I mean, that's where the position we're in, Lillian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1220)|
| 0:20:23| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1223)|
| 0:20:24| You know, you're wanting to come on this board, but yet you're suing Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1224)|
| 0:20:26| Now, wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1226)|
| 0:20:28| She's not suing Knox County and we have a member sitting on this panel already that's involved in that too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1228)|
| 0:20:35| Commissioner Labrett, Commissioner Smith has the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1235)|
| 0:20:39| But that's what we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1239)|
| 0:20:42| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1242)|
| 0:20:43| But, Larry, I would hope that people, and I think most mature people who are involved in a lot of business matters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1243)|
| 0:20:53| they realize that you have to be open-minded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1253)|
| 0:20:56| and that you have to be willing to work with people no matter who they are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1256)|
| 0:21:00| or what your personal feelings are for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1260)|
| 0:21:03| You have to put that aside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1263)|
| 0:21:06| You have to work on and make decisions on what is before you at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1266)|
| 0:21:11| And that's exactly what I'll do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1271)|
| 0:21:13| You know, Mr. Ragsdale, if he has any problems or whatever, those are his problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1273)|
| 0:21:20| But if I am appointed to this position, it is my obligation to set those things aside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1280)|
| 0:21:27| and I'm supposed to be doing what is best for my district and my county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1287)|
| 0:21:31| And that is absolutely my intention if I'm appointed to this seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1291)|
| 0:21:36| When you talk to constituents and whatnot, will you follow up if somebody calls on a pothole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1296)|
| 0:21:41| or something needs to be done, sign down, will you follow up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1301)|
| 0:21:44| I absolutely will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1304)|
| 0:21:47| In my business, if you don't follow up, you don't get a paycheck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1307)|
| 0:21:51| What are your views and concerns for education funding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1311)|
| 0:21:57| Well, I am very much into the education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1317)|
| 0:22:02| If we don't have education, then we have no chance of being in the economic market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1322)|
| 0:22:09| I think that as far as the funding and all of that, that's just a whole big issue that all of us have to think about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1329)|
| 0:22:18| and study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1338)|
| 0:22:19| But I do think that we want the people who are teaching our young kids and our young adults,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1339)|
| 0:22:28| we want them to be top notch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1348)|
| 0:22:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1352)|
| 0:22:33| And you've already talked about the intake center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1353)|
| 0:22:35| What do you feel about take-home cars, free parking and cell phones?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1355)|
| 0:22:39| We're in the middle of looking at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1359)|
| 0:22:41| Well, I was glad to see that somebody is taking that issue on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1361)|
| 0:22:47| It's everywhere that we can cut a little bit, even if it's just a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1367)|
| 0:22:52| You take a lot of little bits and you wind up with a lot sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1372)|
| 0:22:55| So I think that's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1375)|
| 0:22:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1377)|
| 0:22:58| And one last question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1378)|
| 0:22:59| I appreciate y'all's efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1379)|
| 0:23:00| We need to ask of everybody, are you aware of the sunshine law?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1380)|
| 0:23:02| I know the sunshine law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1382)|
| 0:23:04| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1384)|
| 0:23:05| Mr. Pinkston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1385)|
| 0:23:07| Yes, Ms. Williams, I happened to be on that ouster suit with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1387)|
| 0:23:11| And you were called by a certain individual probably and asked to be on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1391)|
| 0:23:15| And I remember you telling me when we went down to the district attorney,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1395)|
| 0:23:18| the only reason you were on this, you thought it needed to be behind Knox County one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1398)|
| 0:23:22| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1402)|
| 0:23:23| I just want everybody to know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1403)|
| 0:23:24| You were called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1404)|
| 0:23:25| Whether he's found innocent, guilty or what, you said this just needs to be put behind us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1405)|
| 0:23:29| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1409)|
| 0:23:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1410)|
| 0:23:31| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1411)|
| 0:23:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1412)|
| 0:23:34| This will be a fairly, I guess, straightforward question, not necessarily a simple one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1414)|
| 0:23:38| but that I'll ask of all candidates if another commissioner is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1418)|
| 0:23:45| And that is, you know, and I'm sure we all want a great educational system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1425)|
| 0:23:49| and structure within Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1429)|
| 0:23:51| You spoke on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1431)|
| 0:23:53| If at the end of the day it comes down to a funding issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1433)|
| 0:23:58| if what's keeping us from being a C plus facility or system to a minus type facility is funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1438)|
| 0:24:07| would you be willing to raise taxes in order to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1447)|
| 0:24:16| That is a tough question because everybody knows all of us want our taxes to be kept as low as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1456)|
| 0:24:23| But, again, education is a very, very important issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1463)|
| 0:24:28| And I think that most citizens can accept the fact that their taxes may go up in order to fund our education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1468)|
| 0:24:39| That is one of the most important things in Knox County is the education system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1479)|
| 0:24:43| So I will certainly address that issue when it comes, and I will be fair and I'll be open-minded about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1483)|
| 0:24:51| Seeing no other light, thank you, Ms. Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1491)|
| 0:24:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1493)|
| 0:24:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1498)|
| 0:25:08| Michelle Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1508)|
| 0:25:17| Ladies first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1517)|
| 0:25:21| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1521)|
| 0:25:22| My name is Michelle Carringer, and I live at 5024 Ivy Rose Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1522)|
| 0:25:29| First of all, I would like to thank all the commissioners who have helped organize tonight's meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1529)|
| 0:25:35| and especially Chairman Strickland and our Larry Smith for the extra time that they have spent to make tonight possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1535)|
| 0:25:43| I'd also like to thank everyone in the audience for caring about the fate of the 7th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1543)|
| 0:25:50| Now, a little bit about my personal life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1550)|
| 0:25:53| I was born and raised in the 7th District, attended Shannondale Elementary, Gresham Middle School, and Central High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1553)|
| 0:26:01| I then went on to attend the University of Tennessee in the College of Communications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1561)|
| 0:26:06| where I met my husband, Dr. Mike Carringer, who was also born and raised in the 7th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1566)|
| 0:26:12| We have been married now for 27 1⁄2 years and have raised two children, Dr. Christy Carringer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1572)|
| 0:26:19| who is an internal medicine resident at UT Hospital, and Kent Carringer, who is a junior at the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1579)|
| 0:26:27| As for my professional life, for over 22 years I was an active stay-at-home mom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1587)|
| 0:26:33| and during those years I was a Jafra cosmetics manager being responsible for 10 salespeople.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1593)|
| 0:26:40| I also have a passion for children and was given the opportunity to substitute teach in grades 1 through 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1600)|
| 0:26:48| I had a part-time job in a retail clothing store where I loved interacting with the customers face-to-face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1608)|
| 0:26:55| And in 2005, I took a position as a deputy court clerk in the Knox County General Sessions Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1615)|
| 0:27:03| I changed to part-time in 2007, working approximately two to three days per week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1623)|
| 0:27:11| I am presently on leave without pay pending this appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1631)|
| 0:27:16| And I have submitted my resignation should I be awarded this seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1636)|
| 0:27:22| With regard to community service, I have been very active throughout my life with volunteer work in the 7th District as well as Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1642)|
| 0:27:31| Some of the highlights for me have been my work with Akeema, a nonprofit service organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1651)|
| 0:27:39| where I served on the board and chaired a variety of projects and assisted with fundraising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1659)|
| 0:27:45| Some of these activities were working with the National Kidney Foundation fundraisers, serving meals at the Sunshine Industry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1665)|
| 0:27:54| working in the clothes closet at the Ronald McDonald House, assisting with Big Brothers Big Sisters of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1674)|
| 0:28:01| responsible for all of the crafts at KidFest for the Dogwood Arts Festival,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1681)|
| 0:28:06| and volunteering at the Interfaith Health Clinic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1686)|
| 0:28:09| In addition to Akeema, my family are members of the Fountain City Arts Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1689)|
| 0:28:15| where my husband and I are on the Knox County Foster Care Review Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1695)|
| 0:28:20| I am also the first vice president-elect of the Knoxville Academy of Medicine Alliance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1700)|
| 0:28:26| where I'm involved with programs such as SAVE, which stands for Stop America's Violence Everywhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1706)|
| 0:28:34| and it is being promoted at the state and national level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1714)|
| 0:28:38| And the TAP program, which stands for Teen AIDS Prevention Program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1718)|
| 0:28:44| where I go into the Knox County middle schools and teach AIDS education and prevention to 7th and 8th graders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1724)|
| 0:28:53| My vision for the 7th District and Knox County would be to continue to build up the new Harvest Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1733)|
| 0:29:00| the Clayton Park, and also the Tommy Shumpert Park, which still has about 133 acres to be finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1740)|
| 0:29:09| I would love to work with the Parks and Recreation in making sure that we make these parks the best that they can be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1749)|
| 0:29:17| I want to stay up on all the blotted properties in the 7th District, such as the Black Oak Motel on Maynardville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1757)|
| 0:29:25| We need to make sure that these places are complying with the codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1765)|
| 0:29:30| And the seniors in the 7th District, as well as all of Knox County, are very dear to my heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1770)|
| 0:29:36| They are the ones who have worked hard through the years and paved the way for me and for my children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1776)|
| 0:29:42| and hopefully someday for my grandchildren.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1782)|
| 0:29:45| I want them to know that I care and appreciate them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1785)|
| 0:29:49| And if appointed, I will be there to support them, specifically in the high school area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1789)|
| 0:29:55| I would plan to attend the monthly meetings with their senior group to keep up with their needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1795)|
| 0:30:01| You have one minute, Ms. Carrington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1801)|
| 0:30:03| Also, I would like to see that there was more funding for the high school volunteer fire department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1803)|
| 0:30:09| And I would work closely with the Hall Senior Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1809)|
| 0:30:12| I'm always in favor of development as long as it's done responsibly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1812)|
| 0:30:16| And in regarding education, I realize there may not be extra funds to give to the schools on this year's budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1816)|
| 0:30:23| but I would try to build a relationship with the principals and staff at the 12 schools in the 7th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1823)|
| 0:30:30| And with fundraising and to help promote a mentoring program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1830)|
| 0:30:35| And also, I would like to help Adrian Burnett with some of their big needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1835)|
| 0:30:40| And I realize the intake center is also a big issue for commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1840)|
| 0:30:45| and I would sit down with Sheriff Jones and discuss the best decision for the Knox County people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1845)|
| 0:30:52| With regard to the budget, I believe that the government has the responsibility to be good stewards of the public's trust,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1852)|
| 0:30:59| and especially during these financial times, government should set the example of working within its means to eliminate waste| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1859)|
| 0:31:08| and to maximize the efficiency of its service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1868)|
| 0:31:11| In closing, when people ask me why I want this appointment, it simply boils down to one word, service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1871)|
| 0:31:20| I believe that government is here to serve people, not the other way around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1880)|
| 0:31:25| My entire life, I've had a heart to serve people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1885)|
| 0:31:29| and I can think of no better opportunity than as a Knox County commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1889)|
| 0:31:34| At this point in my life, okay, well, I feel like I have the time at this point in my life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1894)|
| 0:31:40| and I would like to thank you all for giving me this opportunity, and I would truly appreciate your vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1900)|
| 0:31:50| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1910)|
| 0:31:52| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1912)|
| 0:31:53| Thanks, Ms. Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1913)|
| 0:31:55| I think you've mentioned already that is it true that you're not interested in running when this terms up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1915)|
| 0:32:02| Yes, because we really don't know what's going to happen for 2010 with the redistricting and all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1922)|
| 0:32:10| Okay, so you kind of committed early on to saying you'd be a caretaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1930)|
| 0:32:13| Could you talk about why you think that's a good thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1933)|
| 0:32:19| Well, as I said, I feel like I have the time in my life right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1939)|
| 0:32:23| I am about serving the people, and I would promise that I would work hard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1943)|
| 0:32:29| that nobody would make work any harder because I want to make sure that we keep Knox County the greatest place to live| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1949)|
| 0:32:37| and to raise a family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1957)|
| 0:32:41| Commissioner Luther.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1961)|
| 0:32:44| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1964)|
| 0:32:46| Same question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1966)|
| 0:32:48| If Scott Moore is successful in his appeal, and, you know, we're talking about this transition of power being smooth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1968)|
| 0:32:57| and up in Washington, D.C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1977)|
| 0:32:59| This is a distinct possibility here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1979)|
| 0:33:04| Would you willingly step aside if that were to happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1984)|
| 0:33:08| I absolutely would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1988)|
| 0:33:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1990)|
| 0:33:11| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1991)|
| 0:33:13| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1993)|
| 0:33:14| Ms. Carringer, is there anything at all that would present a conflict of interest for you to serve on this body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=1994)|
| 0:33:21| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2001)|
| 0:33:26| You mentioned a variety of things with regards to the 7th District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2006)|
| 0:33:30| and you have quite an ambitious list given our economic situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2010)|
| 0:33:35| If you could leave in a year-and-a-half or so and look back on your year-plus service on commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2015)|
| 0:33:42| what's the one or two things that you would really like to see accomplished for your district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2022)|
| 0:33:46| Well, and there's several things there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2026)|
| 0:33:49| I realize that Adrian Burnett has several needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2029)|
| 0:33:52| I would like to try to work with them and find out what we could do to best fit their needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2032)|
| 0:33:58| And also with that high school fire department, it's a volunteer fire department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2038)|
| 0:34:02| and obviously they need more funds and our seniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2042)|
| 0:34:07| And as I mentioned, the blotted properties, I'd like to try to take care of as many of those properties as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2047)|
| 0:34:14| And basically, I mean, like I mentioned, in the parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2054)|
| 0:34:20| to make sure that we're using all of the space there that we have planned to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2060)|
| 0:34:27| With regards to the vacant lot and the blotted property, I'm on that committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2067)|
| 0:34:32| and we're bringing before county commissions some pretty controversial lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2072)|
| 0:34:36| It may get down to the point that if these lots are going to be cleaned up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2076)|
| 0:34:40| and if they're not going to be blotted, that Knox County may have to take those properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2080)|
| 0:34:45| No one likes to even talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2085)|
| 0:34:47| That may have to be the option if indeed, you know, would you be willing to condemn property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2087)|
| 0:34:55| Yes, I would because I feel that if you're fortunate to own the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2095)|
| 0:35:01| that you should keep it up for your other neighbors in order for their values to stay up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2101)|
| 0:35:08| But would you vote for the county to take it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2108)|
| 0:35:13| I would want to work with the owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2113)|
| 0:35:16| and give them every opportunity that could possibly be to help them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2116)|
| 0:35:23| even if it was to try to help get some volunteer people in there to help clean it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2123)|
| 0:35:28| I would want to try to work with the owners the best I could before something like that had to take over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2128)|
| 0:35:33| And my final question, what is it about Michelle Carringer that you would want to say to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2133)|
| 0:35:39| that makes you the choice for this seat?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2139)|
| 0:35:43| Well, as I stated, I'm born and raised in the 7th District and so is my husband.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2143)|
| 0:35:49| We have raised our family there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2149)|
| 0:35:51| My parents are still there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2151)|
| 0:35:52| His parents are still there as well as all the family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2152)|
| 0:35:55| I dearly love the 7th District as well as Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2155)|
| 0:35:59| I think it's the best place to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2159)|
| 0:36:01| I love people, and I love serving people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2161)|
| 0:36:08| I'd like to take this time to say that all the commissioners are here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2168)|
| 0:36:11| and I'm especially happy that Commissioner Amy Browse is back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2171)|
| 0:36:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2175)|
| 0:36:20| And I have to say it's entirely my fault that Finbar is late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2180)|
| 0:36:25| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2185)|
| 0:36:27| And it's your turn, Commissioner Browse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2187)|
| 0:36:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2190)|
| 0:36:31| I'm impressed with your record in helping youth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2191)|
| 0:36:34| That's very, very important to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2194)|
| 0:36:37| And I have a question about the TAP program, about prevention of AIDS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2197)|
| 0:36:41| Is this an abstinence-only program that you teach?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2201)|
| 0:36:45| It is to teach children about the teen AIDS prevention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2205)|
| 0:36:50| and educate them on AIDS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2210)|
| 0:36:56| Obviously, you would hope they would come away from wanting to abstain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2216)|
| 0:37:03| What we go in and we actually teach them what can happen and how easily it can happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2223)|
| 0:37:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2229)|
| 0:37:10| So I guess what I'm asking is, do you teach them that the only way that they can keep from getting AIDS is abstinence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2230)|
| 0:37:17| or are you truthful with them about how abstinence or how AIDS is transmitted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2237)|
| 0:37:24| I want my teenagers, if she's listening, to be abstinent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2244)|
| 0:37:29| I want all teenagers to be abstinent until they're mature enough to handle the results of their actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2249)|
| 0:37:35| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2255)|
| 0:37:36| But I also live in the real world, and I want our students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2256)|
| 0:37:39| and our children to have the correct information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2259)|
| 0:37:42| So I'm just curious about this program, whether it's an abstinence-only program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2262)|
| 0:37:47| Well, yes, that's how I firmly believe, and that is how the medical alliance believes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2267)|
| 0:37:52| because it strictly all comes from the medical text of what we're teaching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2272)|
| 0:38:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2282)|
| 0:38:03| That was all I had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2283)|
| 0:38:04| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2284)|
| 0:38:05| Commissioner Smith, if it's okay, I'll let, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2285)|
| 0:38:09| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2289)|
| 0:38:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2291)|
| 0:38:14| Similar question, and I guess to give some background, about a year ago I was sitting where you all were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2294)|
| 0:38:22| and myself and Commissioner Wright, Commissioner Briggs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2302)|
| 0:38:25| and I see former Commissioner Davis in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2305)|
| 0:38:29| And that was, of all the questions, there were some tough questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2309)|
| 0:38:32| And I think that one struck me as the most fair in that it's a tough question, but it's real.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2312)|
| 0:38:40| You know, in terms of what we do, we fund the Knox County school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2320)|
| 0:38:47| So while tough, I do think it's fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2327)|
| 0:38:50| So similar question to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2330)|
| 0:38:52| In terms of where we are right now, if it came down to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2332)|
| 0:38:55| if it comes down to making Knox County a truly great school system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2335)|
| 0:39:03| increasing the programs, increasing the production,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2343)|
| 0:39:09| would you be willing to raise, and it was only a fiduciary issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2349)|
| 0:39:13| We're there, but we need additional funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2353)|
| 0:39:16| or we need more funds because of the state or whatever to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2356)|
| 0:39:21| Would you be willing to raise taxes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2361)|
| 0:39:24| Well, raising taxes is never my first answer to a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2364)|
| 0:39:28| And also throwing money into something is not always, I don't think, the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2368)|
| 0:39:33| What, you know, I think you can throw tons and tons of money into something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2373)|
| 0:39:38| and never get the results that you want to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2378)|
| 0:39:42| I do believe we have some well-qualified Knox County teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2382)|
| 0:39:46| and I would be willing to do whatever I possibly could to help with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2386)|
| 0:39:52| And that's why I personally would like to have a program where they set up more mentoring to let children know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2392)|
| 0:40:00| that they are cared about because so many of them are coming from homes that don't have anyone caring for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2400)|
| 0:40:07| And it's proven that mentoring does help raise test scores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2407)|
| 0:40:12| And so my question would, or answer would be not to raise taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2412)|
| 0:40:18| but I would also have to study on the issues as to why specifically we need to raise them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2418)|
| 0:40:26| because I think we can do more with the schools besides just keep funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2426)|
| 0:40:34| Commissioner Mark Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2434)|
| 0:40:36| Would you ask to serve and expected to be seated on the Board of Zoning Appeals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2436)|
| 0:40:41| I would gladly serve on any board that I was asked upon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2441)|
| 0:40:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2447)|
| 0:40:50| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2450)|
| 0:40:52| First question is for Commissioner Leuthold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2452)|
| 0:40:55| Greg, you mentioned a couple of weeks ago how many people that we represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2455)|
| 0:40:59| How many is it, 30,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2459)|
| 0:41:02| According to the last census, which was the 2000 census, it was roughly all the commission districts outside of the fifth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2462)|
| 0:41:11| were representing a little more than 40,000, 41, 42, somewhere in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2471)|
| 0:41:15| The fifth district is a little over 60.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2475)|
| 0:41:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2478)|
| 0:41:19| And the reason I'm asking this, you answered a lot of my questions in your speech.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2479)|
| 0:41:23| Commissioner Hammond, you know, came across a lot of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2483)|
| 0:41:26| But you were, I was impressed that you were very specific in what you've done with the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2486)|
| 0:41:31| Because to me, if you haven't done things in the community, that's where you get the feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2491)|
| 0:41:37| You're not a one-man show, one-woman show out there, this is how I'm going to vote this way or that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2497)|
| 0:41:42| You don't just represent yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2502)|
| 0:41:44| You represent 40,000 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2504)|
| 0:41:47| And to me, unless you have your pulse on that community by being active,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2507)|
| 0:41:51| so I was, I like what you said there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2511)|
| 0:41:55| And I think that's one of your biggest assets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2515)|
| 0:41:57| That was a question that I had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2517)|
| 0:41:59| What experience, if any, and I'll say, some of these questions I'm asking you people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2519)|
| 0:42:02| and it's all right to say yes and no if you don't have any experience in stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2522)|
| 0:42:07| What experience do you have working with budgets and how big?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2527)|
| 0:42:11| Well, of course, as far as budget, I've always ran our household budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2531)|
| 0:42:18| But with the fundraisers, they vary from anywhere from $60,000 to $70,000 to as little as $15,000 or $16,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2538)|
| 0:42:30| I have always been more into the working end of all the services that I've been involved in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2550)|
| 0:42:38| and not so much in the budget planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2558)|
| 0:42:42| And what experience, if any, have you had with zonings, commercial or residential?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2562)|
| 0:42:46| I have to answer and say I've not had any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2566)|
| 0:42:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2569)|
| 0:42:50| Would you be available during the day to attend meetings at 10 o'clock, 8 o'clock in the morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2570)|
| 0:42:54| 3 o'clock and meet with constituents at 1.30 in a subdivision and at meetings at nights and on weekends?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2574)|
| 0:43:00| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2580)|
| 0:43:01| That's why if I am appointed to this seat, it's going to be a full-time job for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2581)|
| 0:43:08| And will you vote on every issue that you don't have a personal conflict in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2588)|
| 0:43:14| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2594)|
| 0:43:17| You've paid your taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2597)|
| 0:43:18| You've been voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2598)|
| 0:43:22| You've not been found guilty of any felony or anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2602)|
| 0:43:26| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2606)|
| 0:43:27| And you talked about government conflicts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2607)|
| 0:43:30| So, if appointed, you'll resign from that position?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2610)|
| 0:43:34| I have already submitted a letter that would go into effect if I was awarded the seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2614)|
| 0:43:41| And will you do what you say to constituents?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2621)|
| 0:43:43| Absolutely will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2623)|
| 0:43:49| Do you have any personal views on the intake center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2629)|
| 0:43:55| You know, my view on that would be to sit down with Sheriff J.J. Jones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2635)|
| 0:44:01| and go through what he is planning and then, to the best of my knowledge, research it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2641)|
| 0:44:08| and make sure that I make the right decision for the people of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2648)|
| 0:44:15| You've already, Commissioner McKenzie, talked about education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2655)|
| 0:44:17| What are your views on take-home cars, people that park for free here in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2657)|
| 0:44:23| and cell phones, BlackBerrys?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2663)|
| 0:44:25| We're sort of looking into that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2665)|

| 0:44:38| having to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2678)|
| 0:44:39| I think we need to look at every detailed item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2679)|
| 0:44:43| and make sure that the money, Knox County taxpayers' money, is being spent wisely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2683)|
| 0:44:53| Did you talk on specifically what you've done in the 7th District?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2693)|
| 0:44:57| Did you cover?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2697)|
| 0:45:00| Yes, as far as in the 7th District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2700)|
| 0:45:06| where I have been involved with this Central High School alumni.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2706)|
| 0:45:11| I have worked with several fundraisers with all the schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2711)|
| 0:45:16| and been very active in any of the, with the Fount City Arts Center and supporting it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2716)|
| 0:45:25| and wanting to work with the parks and make sure that they're developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2725)|
| 0:45:31| One last question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2731)|
| 0:45:32| What's your biggest asset?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2732)|
| 0:45:34| What's your biggest asset that you'd bring to the 7th District?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2734)|
| 0:45:37| I think my personality and my energy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2737)|
| 0:45:42| I love people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2742)|
| 0:45:43| I love being around people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2743)|

| 0:46:26| Andrew Graybiel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2786)|
| 0:46:31| Thank you, Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2791)|
| 0:46:32| Good morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2792)|
| 0:46:35| My name is Andrew Graybiel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2795)|
| 0:46:36| I reside at 3321 Whispering Oaks Drive, Knoxville, 37938.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2796)|
| 0:46:42| I've been a resident of the 7th District for over 18 years and as well as part of one of the first families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2802)|
| 0:46:48| of Halls dating back to 1895.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2808)|
| 0:46:52| I want to thank the members of County Commission for allowing me this time as I will be brief,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2812)|
| 0:46:57| precise, as my objectives were listed on my resume before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2817)|
| 0:47:03| With respect to education, the majority of our tax dollars are spent on education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2823)|
| 0:47:09| As commissioner, I would focus on spending of educational funds wisely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2829)|
| 0:47:15| Properly educated students bring forth unlimited opportunities which will create future generation growth for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2835)|
| 0:47:24| I, as one, was a graduate of Fulton High School in the inner city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2844)|
| 0:47:30| Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2850)|
| 0:47:32| I have personally watched our district flourish from the rural, agricultural,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2852)|
| 0:47:37| and small business environment in the 7th District to a major commercial and residential development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2857)|
| 0:47:44| I would envision future development for the 7th District and throughout Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2864)|
| 0:47:50| Landowners should have the option to sell for future development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2870)|
| 0:47:54| However, future development shall not harm the community or any adjacent landowner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2874)|
| 0:48:02| In regards to governmental waste, funding decisions from Knox County Commission should be conservative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2882)|
| 0:48:11| Using caution prior to spending of our tax dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2891)|
| 0:48:17| Our weak local and nationwide economy should be carefully monitored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2897)|
| 0:48:23| As a commissioner, I certainly would research prior to making financial decisions which affect each and every citizen of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2903)|
| 0:48:32| The best interest of the citizens of the county shall be my first priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2912)|
| 0:48:38| Commissioner accountability and accessibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2918)|
| 0:48:41| As a commissioner in the 7th District, I would be accessible to the citizens at all times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2921)|
| 0:48:47| I am assertive to be a pledge to a servant for the citizens of Knox County and through my efforts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2927)|
| 0:48:54| and knowledge giving back to the community in which I would proudly, honestly, and openly serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2934)|
| 0:49:02| On a personal note, I am not envious of you to render a decision as a commissioner in the 7th District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2942)|
| 0:49:11| before you are a fine group of young ladies and gentlemen whom I would be proud| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2951)|
| 0:49:17| whether the decision is made for me or another to have served as my county commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2957)|
| 0:49:24| I make a personal pledge to Knox County that our county commission is not the place for politicians or a protege.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2964)|
| 0:49:32| Our citizens deserve properly trained leaders, someone with experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2972)|
| 0:49:38| someone who possesses a high standard of ethics and a personal history to match.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2978)|
| 0:49:44| I have these qualities, which is why I want to be the appointed commissioner for the 7th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2984)|
| 0:49:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2992)|
| 0:49:54| Commissioner Lupo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2994)|
| 0:49:56| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2996)|
| 0:49:58| Mr. Graybill, you probably know my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=2998)|
| 0:50:02| If Scott Moore is successful in his appeal, would you step aside willingly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3002)|
| 0:50:09| I will turn my light off and go home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3009)|
| 0:50:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3011)|
| 0:50:12| And the reason why I ask this question is that at the last commission meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3012)|
| 0:50:17| when we were discussing whether or not to even appoint someone or should we wait, should we not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3017)|
| 0:50:25| the legal ramifications were discussed and why we had to do it within a certain amount of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3025)|
| 0:50:32| and what are the consequences if his appeal were successful or unsuccessful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3032)|
| 0:50:38| And, you know, I just want to make sure that with everything that Knox County has gone through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3038)|
| 0:50:45| over the last two years, I want to make sure that Knox County's transition of power is as smooth as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3045)|
| 0:50:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3054)|
| 0:50:57| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3057)|
| 0:50:59| Mr. Chairman, Mr. Graybill, thank you for stepping up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3059)|
| 0:51:02| Thank you for putting your name out there for consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3062)|
| 0:51:05| It's my understanding that we will be making this appointment on the 26th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3065)|
| 0:51:09| I'm assuming at the beginning of our meeting, which means that the individual sworn in will be taking their seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3069)|
| 0:51:14| Are you prepared to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3074)|
| 0:51:15| Are you prepared to participate January 26th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3075)|
| 0:51:18| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3078)|
| 0:51:19| What would you say is your number one priority?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3079)|
| 0:51:23| You've got 20 months should you be selected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3083)|
| 0:51:25| At the end of that 20 months, and I've asked everyone basically the same thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3085)|
| 0:51:29| what do you want to see accomplished for the citizens in the 7th District?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3089)|
| 0:51:33| A budget that works for the citizens of Knox County as well as our commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3093)|
| 0:51:39| Of course, each of you know I ran a countywide campaign as property assessor for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3099)|
| 0:51:46| And, you know, I've researched the property values and Mr. Ballard and I have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3106)|
| 0:51:55| we agree that there are properties that are under assessed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3115)|
| 0:51:58| and those will be taken issue for the 2009 reappraisal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3118)|
| 0:52:03| I understand that that's going to be revenue neutral| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3123)|
| 0:52:05| and it could provide funding that we desperately need here in Knox County as long as we keep it neutral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3125)|
| 0:52:14| Are there any conflicts of interest at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3134)|
| 0:52:16| There are no conflicts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3136)|
| 0:52:17| I will make a record to you that my wife, Trish, is an employee of the Knox County Criminal Court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3137)|
| 0:52:23| and she was employed four years prior to our marriage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3143)|
| 0:52:29| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3149)|
| 0:52:32| Similar question that I asked of the other commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3152)|
| 0:52:36| You know that we fund the school system but we don't, basically we don't tell them how that money is spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3156)|
| 0:52:43| However, you know, we're expecting great things and we monitor that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3163)|
| 0:52:48| So, with that said, if an issue came down to funding to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3168)|
| 0:52:55| because as we see money is taken away sometimes to whether even to keep the funding at the same basic rate that it is now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3175)|
| 0:53:02| it requires additional funds from the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3182)|
| 0:53:04| Would you be willing to take the appropriate steps, raise taxes, generate additional funds via, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3184)|
| 0:53:11| the mechanisms that we have to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3191)|
| 0:53:15| With necessary budget cuts throughout Knox County such as where Commissioner Smith was speaking of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3195)|
| 0:53:23| parking cards as well as county vehicles, I think the necessary cuts, ladies and gentlemen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3203)|
| 0:53:28| we could reach a budget where tax increase would be very minimal throughout Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3208)|
| 0:53:35| In the event that we needed the additional funds in speaking with our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3215)|
| 0:53:41| I would be in agreeance to increase the tax to pay for those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3221)|
| 0:53:46| Commissioner Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3226)|
| 0:53:48| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3228)|
| 0:53:49| Thank you, Mr. Graybill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3229)|
| 0:53:51| You're familiar with political activities in Knox County, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3231)|
| 0:53:57| Have you had others besides your just recent run?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3237)|
| 0:54:02| That was my first run in Knox County politics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3242)|
| 0:54:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3245)|
| 0:54:06| Should you be selected for this appointment, what would be your, do you have any anticipated activities in the future politically?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3246)|
| 0:54:19| Do you have aspirations politically in terms of a countywide seat or just trying to check the weather there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3259)|
| 0:54:27| As far as a countywide seat, I have not made the decision for 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3267)|
| 0:54:33| I understand that's, what, 20 months away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3273)|
| 0:54:36| At this point right now, my focus will be just for the immediate seat, and I can't answer that at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3276)|
| 0:54:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3284)|
| 0:54:46| Commissioner Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3286)|
| 0:54:49| Mr. Graybill, I'm just a little curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3289)|
| 0:54:54| A while ago you said that when the tax assessment came out that it would be revenue neutral, which is a true statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3294)|
| 0:55:04| Tax reassessments are supposed to be revenue neutral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3304)|
| 0:55:08| And then you also said it would bring in much needed money to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3308)|
| 0:55:13| I'm just curious, if it's revenue neutral, how is it going to bring in money to Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3313)|
| 0:55:18| Revenue neutral, meaning if all properties throughout Knox County are assessed accurately and proficiently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3318)|
| 0:55:26| we could actually see a decrease in the amount of the base rate at 269 and 280 if county commission votes upon it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3326)|
| 0:55:35| We could use that additional funding, the difference, toward any project that Knox County would need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3335)|
| 0:55:42| So you're advocating a tax increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3342)|
| 0:55:46| If we do a reassessment and there's some properties that are assessed at a, in other words, that are assessed too low,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3346)|
| 0:55:56| and they raise up, of course, that would lower everyone else's property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3356)|
| 0:56:02| You're advocating that we then have a tax increase to get the tax rate back up to current levels?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3362)|
| 0:56:10| We could actually have that ability to where it would not be a burden on the citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3370)|
| 0:56:16| If we have an actual decrease, meaning the assessments across the board are brought to an accurate level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3376)|
| 0:56:22| Yeah, and I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3382)|
| 0:56:24| And the difference in the two would be, quote, saying that's the room to play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3384)|
| 0:56:29| That is the room to actually use for additional programs such as Mr. McKenzie toward education and funding, whatever is needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3389)|
| 0:56:38| The citizens actually would not bear a tax increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3398)|
| 0:56:42| The difference would be used for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3402)|
| 0:56:44| Yeah, but you do understand that tax reassessments are revenue neutral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3404)|
| 0:56:48| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3408)|
| 0:56:49| And that this body would have to increase taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3409)|
| 0:56:53| And I understand if some folks aren't paying their fair share that other folks are overpaying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3413)|
| 0:57:00| You know, if you have a revenue neutral reassessment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3420)|
| 0:57:04| is that the folks that have been overpaying will go back to paying their fair share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3424)|
| 0:57:08| So it actually would be, you know, this body would have to pass a tax increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3428)|
| 0:57:13| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3433)|
| 0:57:15| And you'd be in favor of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3435)|
| 0:57:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3436)|
| 0:57:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3437)|
| 0:57:18| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3438)|
| 0:57:21| Last year I put together a team to play in the Epilepsy Foundation Mud Volleyball Tournament of candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3441)|
| 0:57:33| And I intend to do the same thing this year of commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3453)|
| 0:57:37| And Andrew has experience playing mud volleyball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3457)|
| 0:57:42| I would recommend each and every one of you come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3462)|
| 0:57:44| It is a worthwhile cause and it's fun getting dirty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3464)|
| 0:57:50| Larry, I intend for you to be center on our.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3470)|
| 0:57:55| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3475)|
| 0:57:56| I put a tank on my shoulders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3476)|
| 0:58:00| Andrew, what specifically have you done in the 7th District to get the feel of how you think people are going to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3480)|
| 0:58:07| What have you done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3487)|
| 0:58:08| Of course, running a countywide election for the last 18 months of my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3488)|
| 0:58:12| Of course, 10,000 doors I've knocked on throughout Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3492)|
| 0:58:18| And I've listened to the citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3498)|
| 0:58:20| And, you know, it's a personal feel when you knock on that door and you're asking for a vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3500)|
| 0:58:25| but you also listen at what they expect for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3505)|
| 0:58:28| And one thing that they expect is accountability and professionalism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3508)|
| 0:58:33| Knox County wants to see individuals behind these seats that they understand have their best interest at heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3513)|
| 0:58:41| That's the most thing that was said to me, not have you ran for public office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3521)|
| 0:58:47| You know, are you part of anything that's went on in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3527)|
| 0:58:50| They want to know if you'll accurately, fairly represent each and every citizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3530)|
| 0:58:56| And I'm going to ask you this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3536)|
| 0:58:58| You mentioned in your speech a few minutes ago and in your resume, not a politician and not proteges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3538)|
| 0:59:06| What do you call us up here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3546)|
| 0:59:08| Servants of the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3548)|
| 0:59:09| Correct answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3549)|
| 0:59:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3550)|
| 0:59:11| What experience do you have with budgets and how big?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3551)|
| 0:59:15| In my current occupation now, I'm a realtor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3555)|
| 0:59:20| And I represent one of the largest lenders in the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3560)|
| 0:59:24| And that's Countrywide Mortgage, Deutsche Bank, and Bank of America, which is right next door to our building here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3564)|
| 0:59:31| I handle all of the foreclosures for the East Tennessee District, covering from Bristol to Cookville to Chattanooga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3571)|
| 0:59:40| I've covered all 95 counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3580)|
| 0:59:42| And it is my job to make sure that the dollars are there for the properties and the lesser amount that they're losing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3582)|
| 0:59:53| meaning my budget alone for just this district is well over $5 billion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3593)|
| 1:00:00| And that's my accountability that I have to answer for each and every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3600)|
| 1:00:05| We put a lot of time on commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3605)|
| 1:00:07| Like I said, there's a lot of times you'd be required to go to or expected to be at a lot of meetings, like I say, 10 o'clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3607)|
| 1:00:13| all different times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3613)|
| 1:00:14| Will you be able to make all your committee assignment meetings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3614)|
| 1:00:16| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3616)|
| 1:00:17| I have a staff that was well prepared during the election that I had trained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3617)|
| 1:00:21| I have 11 young ladies and gentlemen that will pick up and take care of my practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3621)|
| 1:00:26| And I am available now for my clients 24 hours a day and expected to whenever I'm needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3626)|
| 1:00:34| Will you vote on every issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3634)|
| 1:00:36| I will vote on every issue as long as I have researched| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3636)|
| 1:00:41| and have the knowledge to make that vote for an intelligent decision for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3641)|
| 1:00:47| And asking everybody, have you ever been found guilty of a felony?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3647)|
| 1:00:51| Absolutely not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3651)|
| 1:00:52| I didn't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3652)|
| 1:00:55| What's your view on the intake center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3655)|
| 1:00:58| The intake center, I will need to sit down with Sheriff Jones and listen to his views and make that decision then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3658)|
| 1:01:09| I think it's unjust fair for me to make a decision from the podium tonight without speaking with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3669)|
| 1:01:15| He is our sheriff and that would be part of my job as a commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3675)|
| 1:01:20| You explained to me, you mentioned in your speech there that you want to spend education funds wisely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3680)|
| 1:01:25| How can you have control of that when we just okay the amount of money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3685)|
| 1:01:31| and we don't have a say on what they do with that money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3691)|
| 1:01:34| How can you interject?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3694)|
| 1:01:36| Spending it wisely, meaning the dollars that we allocate throughout Knox County for the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3696)|
| 1:01:43| that we know, you know, that we're spending the money allocating the actual amount that is needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3703)|
| 1:01:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3711)|
| 1:01:52| What are your views on the take home cars, the free parking and cell phones?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3712)|
| 1:01:57| For a county commissioner or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3717)|
| 1:01:59| For the courthouse employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3719)|
| 1:02:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3720)|
| 1:02:01| I feel as if, and this is my personal view, I brought this out in the election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3721)|
| 1:02:06| that we're paid a salary as an office holder, commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3726)|
| 1:02:11| and we need to drive our own vehicles, supply our own cell phones, be accessible to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3731)|
| 1:02:18| Parking, I understand that it is a reduced rate at some of the local facilities here for the county employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3738)|
| 1:02:26| and I feel as if we as a public servant need to bear that expense through our salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3746)|
| 1:02:31| We can do our part in cutting a whole lot of dollars if each and every one of us do our part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3751)|
| 1:02:39| Do you have a parking pass?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3759)|
| 1:02:40| Absolutely not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3760)|
| 1:02:41| I pay my own parking monthly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3761)|
| 1:02:43| Are you aware of the sunshine law?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3763)|
| 1:02:45| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3765)|
| 1:02:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3766)|
| 1:02:47| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3767)|
| 1:02:48| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3768)|
| 1:02:50| Mr. Graybill, your discussion on budgets, are you just, you say $5 billion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3770)|
| 1:02:57| and that's an astronomical amount of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3777)|
| 1:03:00| You're not responsible for $5 billion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3780)|
| 1:03:02| That's the assets that are held by the banks that you represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3782)|
| 1:03:05| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3785)|
| 1:03:06| I'm responsible for each and every parcel that makes up that $5 billion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3786)|
| 1:03:11| currently $5 billion in making sure that those assets are protected and that I view each parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3791)|
| 1:03:19| That's my job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3799)|
| 1:03:21| Well, my question is really not a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3801)|
| 1:03:25| Protecting a parcel of land for a company in bankruptcy court is a lot different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3805)|
| 1:03:30| than siphoning through $5 billion and making sure it's spent correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3810)|
| 1:03:34| And I think that it's, the answer to that question would be more of an office type budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3814)|
| 1:03:41| and not what the companies that you represent hold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3821)|
| 1:03:46| And I think it, so what type of budget have you dealt with that you're responsible for delegating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3826)|
| 1:03:53| where the money goes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3833)|
| 1:03:55| In my previous occupation as a residential lender,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3835)|
| 1:03:58| I was with Chesterfield Finance here on Gay Street for over 13 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3838)|
| 1:04:02| I was the office manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3842)|
| 1:04:04| And it was my sole discretion for the incoming, outgoing profit and loss,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3844)|
| 1:04:10| how the money was spent, how the employees' raises, performances, the insides and the out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3850)|
| 1:04:18| credit reports, any expense that was related to my office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3858)|
| 1:04:23| and which was over $3 million per year, that was my responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3863)|
| 1:04:29| And I think that's a better answer to the question than being responsible for protecting the assets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3869)|
| 1:04:34| of three other banks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3874)|
| 1:04:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3876)|
| 1:04:39| Thank you, Mr. Graybiel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3879)|
| 1:04:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3880)|
| 1:04:54| Jeff Stooksbury.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3894)|
| 1:04:56| Jeff's got his light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3896)|
| 1:05:02| My name is Jeff Stooksbury.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3902)|
| 1:05:04| I'm a long, I'm a native Knoxvillean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3904)|
| 1:05:09| I'm a, lived in the 7th District all my adult life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3909)|
| 1:05:17| I'm from, live on 5000 Ivy Road Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3917)|
| 1:05:20| I live close to Miss Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3920)|
| 1:05:23| I want to thank these other candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3923)|
| 1:05:26| I'm really impressed with the quality of people that have come out that I've heard so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3926)|
| 1:05:30| And I'm really impressed with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3930)|
| 1:05:34| I felt a sense of duty to apply for this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3934)|
| 1:05:40| When I heard that Commissioner Moore was taken out, that was, I felt, you know, a sense of duty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3940)|
| 1:05:51| that this is something that I should pursue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3951)|
| 1:05:56| One reason is I would like to help restore confidence in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3956)|
| 1:06:04| You know, over the past few years, there's been a lot of negative headlines in the paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3964)|
| 1:06:10| And I'd like to do what I could in this position to help restore some confidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3970)|
| 1:06:18| And since this wouldn't be a position I'd be elected to, I haven't run on any agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3978)|
| 1:06:27| it would be more of a caretaker position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3987)|
| 1:06:29| And I feel like that, you know, the primary goals would be to keep the 7th District safe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3989)|
| 1:06:36| and make it a good place to work and live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=3996)|
| 1:06:40| So I'm in the construction industry, and I live in the 7th District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4000)|
| 1:06:46| and also work in the 7th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4006)|
| 1:06:48| I live in Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4008)|
| 1:06:49| I work in PAL and J.S. Reidner Construction Company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4009)|
| 1:06:55| And I think I would need to keep close contact with the citizens of the 7th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4015)|
| 1:07:06| Like I said, I haven't run on an agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4026)|
| 1:07:08| I've not been elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4028)|
| 1:07:10| I would have been, like I said, in more of a caretaker role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4030)|
| 1:07:16| And I would beyond that, I think helping lower our bonded indebtedness would be a major goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4036)|
| 1:07:30| Now, what I would bring to this position is a fresh perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4050)|
| 1:07:36| I've not been involved with any kind of county government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4056)|
| 1:07:40| I have no relatives in county government, and I've never applied for a position with a county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4060)|
| 1:07:48| I have in my position in construction, I have had business with Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4068)|
| 1:07:55| been in projects, applying for permits and such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4075)|
| 1:08:04| Beyond a fresh perspective, I have a general business sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4084)|
| 1:08:09| I've worked, although I've not worked in Knox with a county or the city or even the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4089)|
| 1:08:18| I have worked with all those, each one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4098)|
| 1:08:21| I've formally worked for TVA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4101)|
| 1:08:24| And in that position, I've dealt with other federal agencies primarily, DOE,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4104)|
| 1:08:34| Department of Defense, National Park Service and such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4114)|
| 1:08:43| And so I'm familiar with some government agencies, although not particularly with Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4123)|
| 1:08:50| Like the rest of the people here, I have a genuine concern for this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4130)|
| 1:08:54| I've lived here virtually all my life, and I plan on staying in the 7th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4134)|
| 1:09:00| Also, I'm a husband.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4140)|
| 1:09:04| I have a wife, Michelle, who's over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4144)|
| 1:09:06| I have two children, Stephen, who's 10, Shannon, who's 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4146)|
| 1:09:11| I'm involved with children at Calvary Baptist Church, where I attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4151)|
| 1:09:19| I'm involved with the Bobcat Youth Football Organization, where I'm a coach and a board member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4159)|
| 1:09:27| And I'm also involved with rec league basketball as a coach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4167)|
| 1:09:34| And I would appreciate your consideration for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4174)|
| 1:09:39| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4179)|
| 1:09:41| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4181)|
| 1:09:43| I'm going to ask you an additional question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4183)|
| 1:09:46| What rec league basketball do you coach?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4186)|
| 1:09:49| It's in the WBBL.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4189)|
| 1:09:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4191)|
| 1:09:52| Because I've coached CBFO basketball for many, many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4192)|
| 1:09:54| So I'm familiar with WBBL.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4194)|
| 1:09:56| It's a very good league.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4196)|
| 1:09:58| Second question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4198)|
| 1:10:01| Like everybody else, if Scott Moore's appeal is successful, will you step aside willingly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4201)|
| 1:10:09| Yes, gladly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4209)|
| 1:10:11| In fact, if I'm picked for this position, you can keep that little paper nameplate instead of the engraved ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4211)|
| 1:10:23| I appreciate that, your answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4223)|
| 1:10:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4226)|
| 1:10:27| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4227)|
| 1:10:29| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4229)|
| 1:10:30| Mr. Stukesbury, thank you for stepping up and being here and willing to put your name out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4230)|
| 1:10:36| I want to ask a couple of questions about the bidding that you had talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4236)|
| 1:10:39| You said that you've been involved and your company has bid on county projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4239)|
| 1:10:42| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4242)|
| 1:10:44| Do you foresee any kind of conflict of interest in the future should your company choose to bid on county projects?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4244)|
| 1:10:52| There would be a possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4252)|
| 1:10:54| I would have to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4254)|
| 1:10:55| How would you handle that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4255)|
| 1:10:59| I may have to recuse myself from certain votes if it would be beneficial, you know, if there's a conflict there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4259)|
| 1:11:09| On just from your perspective, do you see anything that the county could do better in its bid projects?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4269)|
| 1:11:17| I mean, is there anything that if you could make a recommendation as a commissioner to Knox County and its bid procedures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4277)|
| 1:11:23| do you have any suggestions on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4283)|
| 1:11:27| I haven't noticed it lately, but a few years ago I noticed there was a lot of school renovation projects coming up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4287)|
| 1:11:34| and they would go out to bid in June or July and they would go out to bid at such a time that they had to be rushed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4294)|
| 1:11:44| and a lot of overtime work done to get them done by, you know, the start of school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4304)|
| 1:11:49| And I always wondered why those couldn't have been bid earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4309)|
| 1:11:52| and the contractor have an opportunity to buy out all their materials and get long lead items in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4312)|
| 1:11:59| and make a smoother, you know, project as opposed to trying to get it all rushed in before school starts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4319)|
| 1:12:12| Are you ready to go January 26?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4332)|
| 1:12:13| Should you be appointed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4333)|
| 1:12:14| Are you ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4334)|
| 1:12:15| Are you ready to participate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4335)|
| 1:12:17| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4337)|
| 1:12:18| So you feel like you're up to speed on any issues that may come up this month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4338)|
| 1:12:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4341)|
| 1:12:23| Also, what is it about Jeff Stooksbury that would be in your favor as far as you're receiving this appointment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4343)|
| 1:12:30| as opposed to the other candidates?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4350)|
| 1:12:33| I don't know about as opposed to the other candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4353)|
| 1:12:34| Like I said, I've been impressed with what I've heard so far,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4354)|
| 1:12:38| but I'm conservative and have, you know, strong core values that, you know, fall back on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4358)|
| 1:12:48| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4368)|
| 1:12:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4371)|
| 1:12:52| Similar question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4372)|
| 1:12:53| I've asked it, I guess, a few times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4373)|
| 1:12:56| So I don't want to just kind of cut to the chase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4376)|
| 1:12:59| So, you know, are you willing, would you be willing to raise taxes in order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4379)|
| 1:13:06| to keep our educational system where it is or increasing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4386)|
| 1:13:13| I have a hard time voting on a tax increase, especially the way the economy has been going lately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4393)|
| 1:13:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4403)|
| 1:13:24| Well, I mean, I'm asking the question in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4404)|
| 1:13:26| So if the economy was robust in 2004, would you have done it then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4406)|
| 1:13:32| I understand where we are now, but in terms of your willingness to, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4412)|
| 1:13:38| and there is no correct answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4418)|
| 1:13:40| I'm just wanting to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4420)|
| 1:13:41| I don't want to couch it in terms of where we are now as far as the economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4421)|
| 1:13:46| No, not particularly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4426)|
| 1:13:47| I wouldn't be raising taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4427)|
| 1:13:51| Commissioner Mark Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4431)|
| 1:13:55| Would you, if appointed, seek being assigned to the Board of Zoning Appeals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4435)|
| 1:14:01| and insist on being served?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4441)|
| 1:14:03| Seated there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4443)|
| 1:14:04| I have no problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4444)|
| 1:14:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4445)|
| 1:14:08| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4448)|
| 1:14:10| And you'd be a good person for that with your experience that you've got at JS Rodner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4450)|
| 1:14:17| What's your biggest asset, Jeff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4457)|
| 1:14:20| Like I said, I've got strong core values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4460)|
| 1:14:23| I'm an honest person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4463)|
| 1:14:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4465)|
| 1:14:26| What's your experience with budgets?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4466)|
| 1:14:30| I work with them all the time from as little as $200 or $300.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4470)|
| 1:14:35| I think the largest one I worked on was somewhere in the $40 million range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4475)|
| 1:14:43| You all built some big buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4483)|
| 1:14:44| That was actually with TVA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4484)|
| 1:14:48| I'm asking everybody what experience you have with zoning issues and commercial and residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4488)|
| 1:14:52| I do have some being in commercial construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4492)|
| 1:14:57| We attend the meetings and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4497)|
| 1:14:58| I'll go to seven or eight meetings a week, not counting what I go to at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4498)|
| 1:15:02| Will you be able to get away seven to eight times a week during the weekday to attend committee meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4502)|
| 1:15:07| if a constituent needs something out in their neighborhood to go look at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4507)|
| 1:15:11| Are you that flexible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4511)|
| 1:15:14| I would have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4514)|
| 1:15:15| I don't have that flexible schedule all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4515)|
| 1:15:17| There might be a problem sometimes during the workday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4517)|
| 1:15:21| But you wouldn't hesitate to pick up the phone and ask somebody else to help you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4521)|
| 1:15:24| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4524)|
| 1:15:26| Will you vote on every issue that you have no conflict, personal conflict in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4526)|
| 1:15:32| I hate to be that dogmatic, but I would try to, you know, be up to speed on every issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4532)|
| 1:15:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4540)|
| 1:15:41| Have you ever been found guilty of a felony?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4541)|
| 1:15:44| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4544)|
| 1:15:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4545)|
| 1:15:46| Will you follow up with constituents?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4546)|
| 1:15:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4548)|
| 1:15:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4549)|
| 1:15:49| What's your view on the intake center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4549)|
| 1:15:54| From what I know about it, which is not much, it seems like it has some merit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4554)|
| 1:16:00| It makes some sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4560)|
| 1:16:02| But that should maybe push down the road a little bit just because of the, you know, tight budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4562)|
| 1:16:11| Give me some views on the county take-home cars and people that get free parking here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4571)|
| 1:16:17| and cell phone BlackBerrys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4577)|
| 1:16:20| We're looking into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4580)|
| 1:16:21| What do you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4581)|
| 1:16:24| The cars, it might be a case-by-case basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4584)|
| 1:16:27| It might make sense for some people to have cars and some not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4587)|
| 1:16:30| It seems like cell phones are probably a good tool, and they might actually be beneficial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4590)|
| 1:16:36| Would you make recommendations to cut, slash, or whatever if you found people didn't need vehicles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4596)|
| 1:16:43| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4603)|
| 1:16:44| Or if parking had to be raised, the price had to be raised?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4604)|
| 1:16:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4607)|
| 1:16:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4608)|
| 1:16:49| Are you familiar with the Sunshine Law?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4609)|
| 1:16:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4611)|
| 1:16:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4612)|
| 1:16:53| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4613)|
| 1:16:54| Thank you, Mr. Stooksberry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4614)|

| 1:17:18| Well, these are some tough acts to follow up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4638)|
| 1:17:21| My name is Steve Rogers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4641)|
| 1:17:22| I live at 8833 Country View Way, Powell, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4642)|
| 1:17:27| I own and operate what you all call a mom-and-pop store on Tassel Pike, 5417.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4647)|
| 1:17:35| I believe in strong government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4655)|
| 1:17:37| I believe our government should be accountable for itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4657)|
| 1:17:40| and I believe we should combine to increase our educational levels in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4660)|
| 1:17:46| It may not all just be dollars and cents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4666)|
| 1:17:49| It may be like one said, you know, having mentors or things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4669)|
| 1:17:54| But they should be we should be strong in education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4674)|
| 1:17:57| We're a strong Knox County government, and we should have good, good education here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4677)|
| 1:18:05| There's not a lot to tell about myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4685)|
| 1:18:07| I'm a Vietnam veteran.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4687)|
| 1:18:09| I went to Vietnam when I was young, came back, went to college, got my associate degree in business administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4689)|
| 1:18:17| I've worked in construction business, worked at Ford Motor Company until 1974.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4697)|
| 1:18:24| I worked in different things, like an insurance agent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4704)|
| 1:18:30| I worked for Independent Life, Kentucky Central, and John Hancock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4710)|
| 1:18:35| After that, I went back into construction business for a short period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4715)|
| 1:18:39| After that, I was a salesman for Cook's Pest Control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4719)|
| 1:18:43| At the end of that, 1986 is when I opened my first convenience store on Tassel Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4723)|
| 1:18:49| And I've been into it ever since.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4729)|
| 1:18:51| It's not a big business but a small business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4731)|
| 1:18:56| At times, things are good, and when times are bad, you have to tighten your budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4736)|
| 1:19:01| That's what I'm into right now, tight budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4741)|
| 1:19:08| Not a lot to tell about me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4748)|
| 1:19:10| I'm a simple person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4750)|
| 1:19:13| Commissioner Lupo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4753)|
| 1:19:15| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4755)|
| 1:19:17| And, again, if Scott Moore is successful in his appeal, would you be stepping aside willingly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4757)|
| 1:19:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4764)|
| 1:19:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4765)|
| 1:19:27| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4767)|
| 1:19:29| Mr. Rogers, thank you again for stepping up and putting your name out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4769)|
| 1:19:34| I've asked everyone this question about conflicts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4774)|
| 1:19:36| Is there any conflict at all that you see that would prevent you from serving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4776)|
| 1:19:40| or would compromise any vote that you might have to take?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4780)|
| 1:19:43| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4783)|
| 1:19:45| Your priorities for the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4785)|
| 1:19:47| What would you like to see accomplished at the end of the 20 months should you receive this appointment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4787)|
| 1:19:51| I'd like to see our district continue to grow, but I don't want it to hurt neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4791)|
| 1:19:57| I believe in commercial property growing, but I believe we should continue to keep our neighborhoods as neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4797)|
| 1:20:04| I would like to see the senior citizens taken care of in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4804)|
| 1:20:11| I believe the senior citizen center in Hollis is very, very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4811)|
| 1:20:15| My mother goes to it every week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4815)|
| 1:20:19| I believe we should, as a Knox County and hold, look at our educational systems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4819)|
| 1:20:26| and see what we can do with each other to work with the school board to improve our educational in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4826)|
| 1:20:36| Do you feel you'd be ready to go January 26th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4836)|
| 1:20:38| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4838)|
| 1:20:39| You're up on the issues and would be prepared to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4839)|
| 1:20:41| Yes, sir, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4841)|
| 1:20:42| And what is it about Steve Rogers that you would like for us to know that would set you apart from the other candidates?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4842)|
| 1:20:49| Well, like I said, I'm a people's person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4849)|
| 1:20:53| I deal with people good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4853)|
| 1:20:54| I speak to people on different levels, different walks of life every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4854)|
| 1:21:00| I'm a money man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4860)|
| 1:21:01| I squeeze money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4861)|
| 1:21:02| One time I was holding a dollar bill so tight that I seen his tongue hanging out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4862)|
| 1:21:09| That's what I'm the best at is handling money and speaking to people and dealing with people every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4869)|
| 1:21:17| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4877)|
| 1:21:20| I think Commissioner Strickland was tickled by that, by your analogy there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4880)|
| 1:21:26| Similar question, you know, you address education and the needs and the continued needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4886)|
| 1:21:33| and you talked about some, I guess, voluntary kind of mentoring programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4893)|
| 1:21:37| you know, sometimes that does work, but also sometimes it does come down to dollars and cents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4897)|
| 1:21:42| And if you got to the situation where programs are great, but there's a need for dollars and cents there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4902)|
| 1:21:49| would you be willing to raise taxes to generate those funds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4909)|
| 1:21:54| If all other avenues had failed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4914)|
| 1:21:56| then I believe we should raise taxes to keep our education the best in the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4916)|
| 1:22:01| We really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4921)|
| 1:22:02| We need to concentrate on education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4922)|
| 1:22:04| That's our future in this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4924)|
| 1:22:07| Commissioner Naumann?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4927)|
| 1:22:09| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4929)|
| 1:22:10| Thank you, Mr. Rogers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4930)|
| 1:22:13| Just in the last couple of years, there's lots of controversial stuff that has come before the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4933)|
| 1:22:21| Are there any issues, like one or two issues, that you've thought kind of provoked you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4941)|
| 1:22:28| or piqued your interest or gave you a little nudge to go, I might need to step out here and take part in this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4948)|
| 1:22:38| Well, I guess it was probably about four years ago when I got interested in the Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4958)|
| 1:22:45| I've always had a bookkeeper in my business, and I'd get these notes, sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4965)|
| 1:22:50| and mail check to different parts of the government, which I never questioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4970)|
| 1:22:54| I signed my check and mailed the money to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4974)|
| 1:22:57| And then when I started kind of looking at how my money was spent here on county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4977)|
| 1:23:03| and not only local but state and government, that's when I really got interested in government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4983)|
| 1:23:09| and wanted to know where the money went and how it was really issued out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4989)|
| 1:23:14| and to see that it's being used properly and not just being wasted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=4994)|
| 1:23:22| I'm a firm believer I hate to waste.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5002)|
| 1:23:24| I hate to waste time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5004)|
| 1:23:25| I hate to waste money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5005)|
| 1:23:27| I believe that this body right here, our local government, is the one that controls the purse trains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5007)|
| 1:23:35| And we've got to look at every dime that goes out of here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5015)|
| 1:23:40| Thank you, Mr. Rogers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5020)|
| 1:23:42| Commissioner Mark Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5022)|
| 1:23:44| Are you familiar with the operations of the Board of Zoning Appeals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5024)|
| 1:23:48| And if appointed, would you seek to be on that body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5028)|
| 1:23:53| I would be happy to be on anybody that this commission deemed that I should be on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5033)|
| 1:24:02| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5042)|
| 1:24:04| Steve, what have you specifically done in the 7th District in the way of volunteerism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5044)|
| 1:24:11| so you can find the pulse of what's going on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5051)|
| 1:24:14| Well, I've always been interested in our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5054)|
| 1:24:16| I've helped Gibbs out, Central and Halls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5056)|
| 1:24:21| I've been involved in the Tassel Pie community for 20-some odd years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5061)|
| 1:24:26| I've watched most of the kids grow up around there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5066)|
| 1:24:29| They come around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5069)|
| 1:24:31| I've given away golf bags to kids because I'm interested in golf and love to play golf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5071)|
| 1:24:38| As far as any one particular thing, I've just always helped out in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5078)|
| 1:24:44| What's your biggest asset?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5084)|
| 1:24:46| Well, like I said, my biggest asset, I think, is I'm a people person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5086)|
| 1:24:49| I can talk to anybody on any walk of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5089)|
| 1:24:51| And I believe I'm good with money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5091)|
| 1:24:54| And I believe that, well, right now, that's what we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5094)|
| 1:24:57| Somebody up here that's good with business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5097)|
| 1:24:58| We need a businessman up here that knows what it's like to take money in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5098)|
| 1:25:03| And if it tightens up, you have to tighten up your budget a little bit, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5103)|
| 1:25:07| Everything can't be solved by increasing taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5107)|
| 1:25:12| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5112)|
| 1:25:13| I thought you might say your biggest asset was your luncheon special.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5113)|
| 1:25:16| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5116)|
| 1:25:18| Experience with budgets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5118)|
| 1:25:20| Well, the only experience I've had is with my own small budget in my store,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5120)|
| 1:25:25| which I turn maybe half a million a year in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5125)|
| 1:25:28| That's nothing small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5128)|
| 1:25:29| That's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5129)|
| 1:25:30| Any experience with zoning issues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5130)|
| 1:25:32| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5132)|
| 1:25:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5133)|
| 1:25:34| Are you able to attend six to eight meetings a week plus meetings at night?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5134)|
| 1:25:38| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5138)|
| 1:25:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5139)|
| 1:25:40| I think you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5140)|
| 1:25:41| Will you be able to vote on every issue that you have no conflicts in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5141)|
| 1:25:44| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5144)|
| 1:25:45| If I understand what they're all about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5145)|
| 1:25:46| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5146)|
| 1:25:47| Have you ever been found guilty of a felony?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5147)|
| 1:25:49| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5149)|
| 1:25:52| Will you follow up with constituents?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5152)|
| 1:25:53| Yes, I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5153)|
| 1:25:54| Somebody calls you and says they have a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5154)|
| 1:25:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5157)|
| 1:25:58| What's your view on the intake center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5158)|
| 1:26:01| Personally, I think we need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5161)|
| 1:26:03| But I'm just not sure how we can get the money for it right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5163)|
| 1:26:06| You know, it's one of those that need to be studied a little bit more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5166)|
| 1:26:10| but I don't believe in the $440,000 for a study either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5170)|
| 1:26:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5174)|
| 1:26:15| What are your views on the take-home cars, the free parking and the cell phones?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5175)|
| 1:26:19| I think that most of those need to be looked at on an individual basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5179)|
| 1:26:25| And even if they need a take-home car, why should it be an SUV?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5185)|

| 1:26:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5192)|
| 1:26:33| And you're aware of the sunshine law?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5193)|
| 1:26:34| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5194)|
| 1:26:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5195)|
| 1:26:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5198)|
| 1:26:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5199)|
| 1:26:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5202)|
| 1:26:55| Charles Felbrant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5215)|
| 1:27:07| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5227)|
| 1:27:08| And before I get started this evening, I just want to say, Ms. Brules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5228)|
| 1:27:10| I'm glad to see you out tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5230)|
| 1:27:11| I know it's cold, and you've made a great effort to be here, and I hope you're feeling better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5231)|
| 1:27:16| Ladies and gentlemen, I want to thank you for the opportunity to come before you this evening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5236)|
| 1:27:19| to express my desires to be appointed to the vacant seat for county commission in the 7th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5239)|
| 1:27:26| Those that have spoken before me and those that will follow will promise to bring the citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5246)|
| 1:27:31| of Knox County honesty and integrity and the attitude of doing the right thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5251)|
| 1:27:37| character qualities that we all share here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5257)|
| 1:27:40| I also want to share with you what uniquely distinguishes who I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5260)|
| 1:27:46| I've been in sales most of my life, developing my intrinsic skills and caring for people's concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5266)|
| 1:27:52| and those skills have helped me to learn how to listen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5272)|
| 1:27:55| and to process information that helps me to be a part of solutions and not problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5275)|
| 1:28:01| I understand the challenges that lie ahead of the budget process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5281)|
| 1:28:04| In my career, I have been entrusted to manage a multimillion-dollar millwork branch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5284)|
| 1:28:09| and have spent many hours involved in budget processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5289)|
| 1:28:13| And I value the opportunity to work together to resolve issues that this budget is surely to bring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5293)|
| 1:28:21| I'm not a person that is so entrenched in an idea that I cannot take no for an answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5301)|
| 1:28:25| I value others' opinions and ideas that work to reach a common goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5305)|
| 1:28:33| You know, most of you know my parents and that I've been involved in public service most of my life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5313)|
| 1:28:38| but you all really don't know me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5318)|
| 1:28:40| My parents practiced and taught me that in public service you are elected by the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5320)|
| 1:28:45| and you work for the people, no matter what their political affiliation may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5325)|
| 1:28:51| Though I may never please all of the people, but if I'm honest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5331)|
| 1:28:56| and respectful to their concerns and their needs, it will make a positive impact no matter the outcome,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5336)|
| 1:29:02| and I believe that still today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5342)|
| 1:29:06| I'm dedicated to serving my community as a board member of the High School Volunteer Fire Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5346)|
| 1:29:11| and surrounding counties and also with Knox County as a member of the Foster Parenting Review Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5351)|
| 1:29:16| I've just been appointed to that in the last couple of months and am thoroughly enjoying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5356)|
| 1:29:21| I'm also privileged by this commission's approval to serve on the Greens Committee at Three Ridges Golf Course| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5361)|
| 1:29:27| where I chair the golf course subcommittee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5367)|
| 1:29:29| And I'd like to say that I have been involved with Three Ridges Golf Course since its inception| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5369)|
| 1:29:33| and Commissioner Norman, I served with your father.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5373)|
| 1:29:36| And I just want to say, I miss your ex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5376)|
| 1:29:38| He was always kind to me and I always appreciated that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5378)|
| 1:29:43| In my personal and professional life, now and how it always has been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5383)|
| 1:29:47| and as a business development manager for Dealers Warehouse and Marvin Concepts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5387)|
| 1:29:51| saying what I will do and doing what I say is crucial in my business as it is in life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5391)|
| 1:29:58| If I do not follow through and follow up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5398)|
| 1:29:59| I may never be given another opportunity to prove myself trustworthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5399)|
| 1:30:04| At the end of the day, I believe my friends and business associates would say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5404)|
| 1:30:08| yeah, we can trust Chuck Severance as a friend and we can trust him with our business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5408)|
| 1:30:14| We can trust Chuck to be accountable for the important issues that affect our well-being on a day-to-day basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5414)|
| 1:30:21| We're a diverse group of people in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5421)|
| 1:30:24| And I've listened to people's concerns the past few months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5424)|
| 1:30:27| And I have found we share a lot of common grounds, good roads, good educations for our young people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5427)|
| 1:30:33| favorable tax rates, proper infrastructures to help our business growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5433)|
| 1:30:39| and safe communities in which to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5439)|
| 1:30:41| Others have expressed their concerns to me about the preservation and expansion of our parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5441)|
| 1:30:46| and greenways and the continued growth of our arts community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5446)|
| 1:30:50| for the enjoyment that it brings to them in their everyday lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5450)|
| 1:30:55| I promise you and the citizens of Knox County to be a good steward of the position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5455)|
| 1:30:59| and the responsibilities that lie ahead of this commission in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5459)|
| 1:31:03| Before I close, I would like to say I know that I haven't contacted each and every one of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5463)|
| 1:31:07| And I will be doing that in the next few days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5467)|
| 1:31:09| I promise you that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5469)|
| 1:31:10| I know we've had some holidays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5470)|
| 1:31:11| I had some surgery during those holidays and was unavailable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5471)|
| 1:31:15| But I will be contacting you and look forward to talking with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5475)|
| 1:31:19| I am asking for your appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5479)|
| 1:31:21| And I thank you for the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5481)|
| 1:31:23| And God bless you and the citizens of Knox County as this body of governing people go forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5483)|
| 1:31:28| with the decisions that will affect us all in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5488)|
| 1:31:33| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5493)|
| 1:31:34| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5494)|
| 1:31:35| And, again, if Scott Moore is successful in his appeal, will you step aside willingly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5495)|
| 1:31:43| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5503)|
| 1:31:44| I believe I've made that very clear at the last county commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5504)|
| 1:31:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5507)|
| 1:31:49| Commissioner Shelf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5509)|
| 1:31:51| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5511)|
| 1:31:54| Any conflicts of interest at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5514)|
| 1:31:56| Not that I know of, no, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5516)|
| 1:31:59| Are you ready to go January 26?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5519)|
| 1:32:01| Do you feel like you're up to speed on the issues and can be an active participant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5521)|
| 1:32:05| I can be an active participant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5525)|
| 1:32:06| I don't know that I'm up to speed on all of the issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5526)|
| 1:32:08| but I plan on, with some phone calls and research in the next few days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5528)|
| 1:32:13| to be ready to go on January 26.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5533)|
| 1:32:15| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5535)|
| 1:32:16| You've given us a list of things that you would like to see accomplished,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5536)|
| 1:32:20| so I'm not going to ask you that question because you've got it well outlined here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5540)|
| 1:32:23| But you're applying for a job, and all of us have applied for jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5543)|
| 1:32:28| and you're in competition with these folks, and you want this job or you wouldn't be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5548)|
| 1:32:32| So what is it about Chuck Severance that you think makes you the person that we should appoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5552)|
| 1:32:38| to this position?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5558)|
| 1:32:40| I work hard every day, and I'm not afraid to tackle tough issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5560)|
| 1:32:45| And I will be very much that way on the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5565)|
| 1:32:48| I'll also be very fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5568)|
| 1:32:50| But I will bring a good, solid work ethic to this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5570)|
| 1:32:57| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5577)|
| 1:33:00| Some of the questions that I've asked the previous candidates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5580)|
| 1:33:06| and that is dealing with how we fund our systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5586)|
| 1:33:11| And if it came down to it, if it came down to a money issue as far as either keeping our schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5591)|
| 1:33:17| at the level that they are now or increasing their strength and achievement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5597)|
| 1:33:23| would you be willing to raise taxes for those revenues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5603)|
| 1:33:27| Commissioner McKenzie, I think that there's a lot of accountability on county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5607)|
| 1:33:34| and also with our school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5614)|
| 1:33:37| You know, I know that our economic times are tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5617)|
| 1:33:41| You know, the bailout plans that the United States has, I don't know what kind of money we may receive for our county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5621)|
| 1:33:46| or for our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5626)|
| 1:33:49| Raising taxes would be my last resort of anything to do for the citizens of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5629)|
| 1:33:56| because their money that they take in I know is very important to them as it is to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5636)|
| 1:34:02| So I would, as a last resort, would raise taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5642)|
| 1:34:09| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5649)|
| 1:34:10| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5650)|
| 1:34:11| Commissioner Mark Harmon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5651)|
| 1:34:14| Board of Zoning Appeals, how familiar are you with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5654)|
| 1:34:17| And if appointed, would you seek to go on that board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5657)|
| 1:34:20| I'm not that familiar with the Zoning Board of Appeals and what takes place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5660)|
| 1:34:23| but I am a little familiar with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5663)|
| 1:34:25| Yes, sir, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5665)|
| 1:34:26| I would be more than willing to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5666)|
| 1:34:31| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5671)|
| 1:34:33| Tell me again, what have you done specifically in the 7th District in the way of volunteerism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5673)|
| 1:34:37| and things like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5677)|
| 1:34:39| Larry, I haven't done a lot with my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5679)|
| 1:34:43| I've traveled a lot of my life and my adult life and haven't been home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5683)|
| 1:34:47| But now I have the opportunity to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5687)|
| 1:34:49| And I'm basically, I'm just getting started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5689)|
| 1:34:51| I've just been appointed to the high school volunteer fire department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5691)|
| 1:34:53| I'm also just appointed recently by Judge Irwin and his group to be on the Foster Parenting Review Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5693)|
| 1:35:00| Other than that, I haven't had a lot of opportunity to be involved in, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5700)|
| 1:35:03| the community activities because we have been represented very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5703)|
| 1:35:07| And since I've been out there by our commissioners and they have worked very hard for our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5707)|
| 1:35:10| I'm very appreciative of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5710)|
| 1:35:12| Did you graduate with Tim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5712)|
| 1:35:14| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5714)|
| 1:35:15| He's older than I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5715)|
| 1:35:17| And what experience did you have with the budgets?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5717)|
| 1:35:20| I had with my company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5720)|
| 1:35:23| I had my own, of course, my own branch budget, which ran about $10 million each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5723)|
| 1:35:28| But as a group, we were 10 to 12 branches strong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5728)|
| 1:35:32| And he had cut a couple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5732)|
| 1:35:33| But we were also entrusted to come together and work on a budget as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5733)|
| 1:35:38| And about $135 million is about where we were each and every year on our budget processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5738)|
| 1:35:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5744)|
| 1:35:45| And what experience do you have with any zoning, residential or commercial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5745)|
| 1:35:48| Other than being in the building business, you know, I'm familiar with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5748)|
| 1:35:51| but I don't have any personal experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5751)|
| 1:35:53| You'd have a feel for it then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5753)|
| 1:35:54| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5754)|
| 1:35:55| Will you be able with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5755)|
| 1:35:56| You say you work for Dealers Warehouse, is that what you're at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5756)|
| 1:35:58| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5758)|
| 1:35:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5759)|
| 1:36:00| Would you be able to make six to eight meetings a week plus night meetings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5760)|
| 1:36:02| You know, Larry, I'm not going to answer that right now and say yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5762)|
| 1:36:06| I know that I can make some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5766)|
| 1:36:07| I don't know that I can make all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5767)|
| 1:36:09| Night meetings I don't have a problem with other than Wednesday nights where I sing in my choir at church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5769)|
| 1:36:13| and we have choir practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5773)|
| 1:36:14| And take your fellow commissioner to lunch and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5774)|
| 1:36:18| And will you be able to vote on every issue that you do not have a conflict in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5778)|
| 1:36:23| Yes, sir, as long as I am up to speed with the issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5783)|
| 1:36:27| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5787)|
| 1:36:28| And I'm assuming you've not been found guilty of a felony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5788)|
| 1:36:31| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5791)|
| 1:36:32| I have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5792)|
| 1:36:33| And will you follow up with constituents?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5793)|
| 1:36:35| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5795)|
| 1:36:36| They call because you don't know who they call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5796)|
| 1:36:37| They call me or they call you and follow up with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5797)|
| 1:36:41| And your views on the intake center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5801)|
| 1:36:45| You know, I just have been listening to what Sheriff Jones brought forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5805)|
| 1:36:51| You know, I think there is a need for the intake center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5811)|
| 1:36:53| And I've heard the dollars and cents that can be taken out of driving back and forth to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5813)|
| 1:36:59| to Maloneyville Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5819)|
| 1:37:00| But until I actually sit down with Sheriff Jones and with other law enforcement agents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5820)|
| 1:37:06| and listen to their take on why we should have it or why we shouldn't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5826)|
| 1:37:13| I would really like to come up to speed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5833)|
| 1:37:15| and hear their concerns before I make any type of a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5835)|
| 1:37:19| And your views on the take-home cars, free parking, and cell phones?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5839)|
| 1:37:24| I take my car home every night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5844)|
| 1:37:27| It's my car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5847)|
| 1:37:28| And I think that people, you know, if they're in a position here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5848)|
| 1:37:32| I believe they should be driving their own vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5852)|
| 1:37:35| I know it's an economic question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5855)|
| 1:37:37| I know it's tough times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5857)|
| 1:37:38| But, you know, I feel like we need to watch our dollars and cents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5858)|
| 1:37:41| And I'm just not in favor of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5861)|
| 1:37:45| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5865)|
| 1:37:47| Mr. Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5867)|
| 1:37:48| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5868)|
| 1:37:49| Thank you, Mr. Severance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5869)|
| 1:37:53| You've, first I guess, have you watched this body perform very much?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5873)|
| 1:38:01| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5881)|
| 1:38:02| I've been to two meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5882)|
| 1:38:03| I think I've attended my first in October and then I attended last month's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5883)|
| 1:38:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5887)|
| 1:38:09| In your understanding of what we've done over the last few years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5889)|
| 1:38:13| are there some issues that particularly interest you or raise your temperature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5893)|
| 1:38:19| or give you heartburn, blah, blah, blah?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5899)|
| 1:38:25| Concerning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5905)|
| 1:38:27| Any topic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5907)|
| 1:38:29| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5909)|
| 1:38:30| I don't really have anything that just stands out today to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5910)|
| 1:38:33| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5913)|
| 1:38:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5914)|
| 1:38:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5915)|
| 1:38:37| Mr. Severance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5917)|
| 1:38:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5918)|
| 1:38:48| Jennifer Weaver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5928)|
| 1:38:59| Thank you, Chairman Strickland, Vice Chair Luthold, members of the Board of Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5939)|
| 1:39:05| Thank you for allowing us to come before you as we seek to serve the citizens of the 7th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5945)|
| 1:39:11| My name is Jennifer Weaver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5951)|
| 1:39:12| I live at 1612 Merrimont Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5952)|
| 1:39:15| I'm seeking this appointment to the vacated seat in the 7th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5955)|
| 1:39:19| Knox County is a great community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5959)|
| 1:39:21| I want to be part of a great county commission that works to allow this community to prosper and thrive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5961)|
| 1:39:27| We need efficient and effective government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5967)|
| 1:39:29| We need to make education our top priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5969)|
| 1:39:32| And we need to continue to provide the infrastructure needed so that businesses with high-paying jobs will locate here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5972)|
| 1:39:39| and that infrastructure includes those excellent schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5979)|
| 1:39:43| I think I can make a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5983)|
| 1:39:44| I want to restore the trust to the 7th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5984)|
| 1:39:47| I'm not looking toward the next election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5987)|
| 1:39:49| I'm only working to help the citizens now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5989)|
| 1:39:52| I have over 15 years of management experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5992)|
| 1:39:55| I currently work for Land Air Distribution Services in Jefferson City, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5995)|
| 1:39:59| I received two degrees from the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=5999)|
| 1:40:02| My bachelor's degree in 1991 and an MBA degree in 1999.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6002)|
| 1:40:07| I was born and raised in Oak Ridge, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6007)|
| 1:40:10| And I married Chris Weaver, a lifelong Knoxvillian, eight years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6010)|
| 1:40:13| And we have two beautiful boys, Cameron and Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6013)|
| 1:40:17| Cameron is actually starting kindergarten this fall at Sturkey Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6017)|
| 1:40:20| I do plan on joining the PTA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6020)|
| 1:40:22| And I'm also actually a first-year soccer mom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6022)|
| 1:40:26| I'm not doing this for political reasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6026)|
| 1:40:29| but because I believe in citizens offering public service when they believe they can help effect change when needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6029)|
| 1:40:36| I was very fortunate and grew up with great parents who were very committed to public and community service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6036)|
| 1:40:41| And they provided an excellent example for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6041)|
| 1:40:45| I want to thank you again for allowing all of us to stand before you this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6045)|
| 1:40:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6053)|
| 1:40:55| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6055)|
| 1:40:57| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6057)|
| 1:40:58| And Ms. Weaver, again, thank you for stepping up and putting your name out for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6058)|
| 1:41:04| Land Air, I see here that it's involved with John Deere products and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6064)|
| 1:41:08| Do you do any business with Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6068)|
| 1:41:10| Does your company do any business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6070)|
| 1:41:11| No, not currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6071)|
| 1:41:13| Land Air, we're a third-party warehousing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6073)|
| 1:41:15| We warehouse and distribute John Deere tractors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6075)|
| 1:41:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6078)|
| 1:41:19| So do you see any conflict of interest at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6079)|
| 1:41:21| No, because most everything I work with is up in Greenville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6081)|
| 1:41:24| But other than your business, are there any personal relationships?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6084)|
| 1:41:28| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6088)|
| 1:41:29| So you don't see any conflict at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6089)|
| 1:41:30| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6090)|
| 1:41:31| My husband does not work for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6091)|
| 1:41:33| My father-in-law and my father are both retired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6093)|
| 1:41:37| What do you see as your main goals for the next 20 months or so that you might be on commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6097)|
| 1:41:45| What would you like to see accomplished, I guess, for the seven districts is what I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6105)|
| 1:41:49| My pet project, the one thing I want to see done is Shumpert Park, if at all possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6109)|
| 1:41:54| But considering the year that we're about to have or the next 20 months we're about to have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6114)|
| 1:41:58| doing whatever I can to help Knox County keep our head above water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6118)|
| 1:42:02| It's going to be a tough budget year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6122)|
| 1:42:05| And I don't think any of the districts can look out for themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6125)|
| 1:42:08| We're going to have to look out for Knox County as a whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6128)|
| 1:42:10| and just get together and do what we need to do to keep it together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6130)|
| 1:42:14| You mentioned that you want to be a caretaker for the position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6134)|
| 1:42:16| You obviously want this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6136)|
| 1:42:19| I know that we've talked and you have a lot of passion for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6139)|
| 1:42:21| I guess I'm asking you the same question as everyone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6141)|
| 1:42:23| You're in competition with these folks and you want this job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6143)|
| 1:42:26| Yeah, these are some great folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6146)|
| 1:42:28| So what is it about Jennifer Weaver that sets you apart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6148)|
| 1:42:31| that will make you the person that needs to be here as opposed to them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6151)|
| 1:42:34| I've got a good work ethic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6154)|
| 1:42:37| I think that's the one thing I can bring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6157)|
| 1:42:39| But, I mean, these are all great candidates and I'm second to last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6159)|
| 1:42:42| I'm sorry, you're going to have to go last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6162)|
| 1:42:46| I was probably going to be mean, but no, you've got some great choices here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6166)|
| 1:42:50| So far I haven't heard anyone that I would be upset with if they were sitting in that seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6170)|
| 1:42:59| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6179)|
| 1:43:03| Similar question, and you kind of stole my thunder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6183)|
| 1:43:05| I was going to demand that I pick the next name out of the hat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6185)|
| 1:43:12| But in terms of making, you know, tough decisions and things that we do monthly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6192)|
| 1:43:19| you know, some big, some little, two-thirds of our budget is for education currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6199)|
| 1:43:26| If the situation came to where we needed additional revenue streams to fund the education system here in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6206)|
| 1:43:37| and it came down to a fiduciary issue, would you be willing to raise taxes to accomplish that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6217)|
| 1:43:43| If we have gone through and rooted out all waste, fraud, and abuse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6223)|
| 1:43:47| if the community was behind it, if Dr. McIntyre came to us with this great plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6227)|
| 1:43:53| he needs this money and we could sell it to the public and put it into the voters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6233)|
| 1:43:57| and let the voters decide for it, then, yes, I'd be absolutely behind letting the voter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6237)|

| 1:44:27| And if appointed, would you seek to serve on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6267)|
| 1:44:29| I know what BZA is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6269)|
| 1:44:30| I've never been to a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6270)|
| 1:44:32| I'm not real familiar with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6272)|
| 1:44:34| If you wanted me on it, I would do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6274)|
| 1:44:37| If my talents could be used elsewhere, I'll go elsewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6277)|

| 1:44:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6289)|
| 1:44:50| What type of MBA is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6290)|
| 1:44:52| There's different types of MBAs at UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6292)|
| 1:44:55| Logistics and transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6295)|

| 1:44:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6298)|
| 1:44:59| Did you, were you working while you got your MBA or were you a full-time student?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6299)|
| 1:45:04| Full-time student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6304)|
| 1:45:05| It was the two-year program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6305)|
| 1:45:06| Two-year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6306)|
| 1:45:09| The caretaker position is interesting to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6309)|
| 1:45:13| Is that a philosophical idea of yours that you think, at this particular time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6313)|
| 1:45:20| this is a good thing for this board to have a caretaker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6320)|
| 1:45:25| somebody that's separating themselves somewhat from the political process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6325)|
| 1:45:30| not trying to take advantage of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6330)|
| 1:45:32| Or do you have other reasons?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6332)|
| 1:45:36| Well, I'm not running, I'm not looking to run in 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6336)|
| 1:45:41| And if you've got more than, if you're thinking about picking a candidate who is wanting to run| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6341)|
| 1:45:46| and one, there's one who isn't, then it's probably unfair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6346)|
| 1:45:50| It would give, if two were, I'm sorry, if two were wanting to run| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6350)|
| 1:45:53| and you picked one and not the other one, it would give one an unfair advantage in 2010| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6353)|
| 1:45:58| when all the seats are opened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6358)|
| 1:46:04| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6364)|
| 1:46:06| Jennifer, what have you specifically done in the 7th District?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6366)|
| 1:46:10| This summer I worked with Knox Charter Petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6370)|
| 1:46:12| I went to every house in my neighborhood and the neighbors beside me getting signatures for the petition drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6372)|
| 1:46:19| You get dog bit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6379)|
| 1:46:20| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6380)|
| 1:46:23| What's your biggest asset?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6383)|
| 1:46:27| My work ethic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6387)|
| 1:46:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6391)|
| 1:46:32| And your experience with budgets and how big?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6392)|
| 1:46:35| I have not worked in accounting groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6395)|
| 1:46:37| And the companies I've worked for are rather large and accounting groups do the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6397)|
| 1:46:42| We work underneath the budget, but I've got my own budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6402)|
| 1:46:45| I've been in the black for 39 years now, so that's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6405)|
| 1:46:49| And, but I do have some private sector experiences that I think could be helpful in the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6409)|
| 1:46:57| Commissioner Harmon asked you about DZA and things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6417)|
| 1:46:59| Do you have any experience, if any, on zoning issues, commercial or residential?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6419)|
| 1:47:04| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6424)|
| 1:47:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6425)|
| 1:47:07| With you working in Jefferson City and the areas that you cover,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6427)|
| 1:47:11| how do you think you're going to be able to balance six to eight meetings a week throughout the weekdays| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6431)|
| 1:47:15| and then meetings at night?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6435)|
| 1:47:17| It won't be a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6437)|
| 1:47:18| You can still do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6438)|
| 1:47:19| Uh-huh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6439)|
| 1:47:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6440)|
| 1:47:22| Will you vote on every issue that you don't have a conflict with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6442)|
| 1:47:25| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6445)|
| 1:47:27| You ever been found guilty of a felony?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6447)|
| 1:47:29| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6449)|
| 1:47:32| Will you follow up with constituents?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6452)|
| 1:47:33| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6453)|

| 1:47:38| Your views on the intake center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6458)|
| 1:47:41| I watched the last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6461)|
| 1:47:43| The intake center is a, looks to be a quick hot button issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6463)|
| 1:47:48| I see the need for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6468)|
| 1:47:49| I also see the need to wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6469)|
| 1:47:51| Maybe putting the capital plan into next year's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6471)|
| 1:47:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6474)|
| 1:47:56| You mentioned this just a minute ago and several other people a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6476)|
| 1:47:59| You talk about education being your top priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6479)|
| 1:48:03| You said that you were asked about that you would put it up to the voters to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6483)|
| 1:48:07| We don't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6487)|
| 1:48:08| It's up to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6488)|
| 1:48:10| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6490)|
| 1:48:11| But if we want to do a property tax increase and have it geared toward education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6491)|
| 1:48:15| we could put it in front of the voters and let them vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6495)|
| 1:48:17| We did it for the sheriff's pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6497)|
| 1:48:19| Are you prepared to vote on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6499)|
| 1:48:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6500)|
| 1:48:22| If it's not put before the voters?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6502)|
| 1:48:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6504)|
| 1:48:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6505)|
| 1:48:26| And your views on the take-home vehicles and cell phones and people that get free parking downstairs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6506)|
| 1:48:30| I'm glad to see that the commission that they're meeting on the cars, because that was a concern of mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6510)|
| 1:48:36| My company actually got rid of the BlackBerries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6516)|
| 1:48:39| They do provide a cell phone, but we have to have our own for personal calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6519)|
| 1:48:42| So I actually carry around two cell phones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6522)|
| 1:48:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6524)|

| 1:51:11| I decided to resign my position, sell everything I had, and move out here to Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6671)|

| 1:53:39| But I stand here to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6819)|
| 1:53:44| I feel that there's a need from things that I've seen, from things that I've heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6824)|
| 1:53:54| The experience of wrongdoing is just as bad as wrongdoing itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6834)|
| 1:54:03| You have one minute, Mr. Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6843)|
| 1:54:05| Everyone here, I have watched hours and hours upon hours of video and how this commission has conducted itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6845)|
| 1:54:17| I've seen things that, you know, that set me back a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6857)|
| 1:54:24| I wished I could be here with no name, no face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6864)|
| 1:54:29| My first and primary goal is to serve the people of the 7th District, the people in Knox County, and the people in this state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6869)|
| 1:54:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6884)|
| 1:54:47| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6887)|
| 1:54:49| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6889)|
| 1:54:52| I appreciate what you do as a registered nurse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6892)|
| 1:54:55| It takes a special person to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6895)|
| 1:54:58| My wife is a registered nurse, so I know what it takes to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6898)|
| 1:55:03| Same question, if Commissioner Moore's appeal is successful, will you willingly step aside?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6903)|
| 1:55:11| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6911)|
| 1:55:13| I mean, that's the rule of law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6913)|
| 1:55:15| That's why we're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6915)|
| 1:55:16| That's what we represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6916)|
| 1:55:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6917)|
| 1:55:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6918)|
| 1:55:19| Commissioner Naumann.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6919)|
| 1:55:21| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6921)|
| 1:55:23| Thank you, Mr. Ross.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6923)|
| 1:55:25| You mentioned that you're an observer of the commission and its activities, not to dredge up the past or anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6925)|
| 1:55:35| but given what you've seen and heard and some of those things obviously disturb you in some ways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6935)|
| 1:55:44| what would you do in the future to promote a more functioning board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6944)|
| 1:55:54| The board functions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6954)|
| 1:55:56| It serves a wonderful purpose for the people of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6956)|
| 1:56:01| But what I would do and what I've seen is that the citizens here come up and they sit for hours upon hours upon hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6961)|
| 1:56:12| just to get their 5, 10, or 15 minutes to speak to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6972)|
| 1:56:20| I would feel obligated to sit in my seat, to have eye contact with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6980)|
| 1:56:27| and to interact with the people that we represent, and that's what I would do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6987)|
| 1:56:33| That's what I'd like to see everybody do because it's who we serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=6993)|
| 1:56:41| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7001)|
| 1:56:43| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7003)|
| 1:56:45| I guess I have one additional question for you, and that's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7005)|
| 1:56:49| I had the other ones memorized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7009)|
| 1:56:52| Well, this one's fairly easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7012)|
| 1:56:54| If chosen, would you promise not to gross the rest of the commission out by talking with Dr. Briggs about cardiovascular surgery?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7014)|
| 1:57:06| No, seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7026)|
| 1:57:09| Same question to you, and that is, you know, we have an awesome responsibility up here to all the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7029)|
| 1:57:20| And if it came down to an issue as it relates to education, there are money issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7040)|
| 1:57:28| I mean, that is where the rubber meets the road in this particular circumstance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7048)|
| 1:57:34| and we need additional revenues and resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7054)|
| 1:57:37| Would you be willing to raise taxes to accomplish that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7057)|
| 1:57:41| Knox County has set, the school board has set some awesome goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7061)|
| 1:57:46| I don't believe that we can have students accomplish things in life by setting the bar low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7066)|
| 1:57:53| I mean, it's got to be difficult academically for the kids to learn anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7073)|
| 1:58:00| It's got to be tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7080)|
| 1:58:01| It can't be given to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7081)|
| 1:58:04| Progress is only made through pain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7084)|
| 1:58:08| It hurts a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7088)|
| 1:58:11| There's a lot of waste that goes on in government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7091)|
| 1:58:14| There's a lot of waste that's out there right now in this government, Knox County, that we could cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7094)|
| 1:58:22| And until those cuts are made, I would find it very difficult to go to the school district first or to cut that first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7102)|
| 1:58:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7111)|
| 1:58:32| But again, and that point comes at every person comes differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7112)|
| 1:58:37| If at the end of the day that is the choice to make, fund or not, would you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7117)|
| 1:58:44| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7124)|
| 1:58:45| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7125)|
| 1:58:46| If that is the path that needs to be taken and all other avenues have been blocked or taken, absolutely, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7126)|
| 1:58:52| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7132)|
| 1:58:55| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7135)|
| 1:58:56| Again, Mr. Ross, thank you for stepping up and doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7136)|
| 1:58:59| You mentioned that you have no enemies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7139)|
| 1:59:01| After your first meeting, that will change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7141)|
| 1:59:04| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7144)|
| 1:59:05| Because no matter how you vote, you're going to have some folks out there that don't like it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7145)|
| 1:59:08| and they take things very personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7148)|
| 1:59:12| I've been under fire before, so I know how to move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7152)|
| 1:59:14| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7154)|
| 1:59:15| So you already answered the question about conflict, so I'm not going to belabor that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7155)|
| 1:59:19| But I'm just interested in a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7159)|
| 1:59:21| First of all, you said that you've spent hours watching our commission meetings and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7161)|
| 1:59:25| and so you have a pretty good handle of what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7165)|
| 1:59:27| But was there any one thing that made you say, wait a minute, I need to be on county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7167)|
| 1:59:33| I need to be there making those decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7173)|
| 1:59:35| I need to be the one sitting there engaging in this debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7175)|
| 1:59:39| Was there any at what point did you make that decision that you said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7179)|
| 1:59:42| and what prompted you to make that decision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7182)|
| 1:59:45| It wasn't a decision that I made from watching what the county was here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7185)|
| 1:59:48| That was just one of the things I'm going, ah, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7188)|
| 1:59:50| these people are here, they want to talk to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7190)|
| 1:59:53| They want to get their voice out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7193)|
| 1:59:55| Sit and listen to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7195)|
| 1:59:58| The question of what I want to do or what brought me to this position here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7198)|
| 2:00:07| I've always been a servant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7207)|
| 2:00:10| Paul said in the Bible, he says that one of the things that he wanted to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7210)|
| 2:00:16| or what he was was a bond servant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7216)|
| 2:00:18| I think that if we were to put that in today's words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7218)|
| 2:00:25| it would be a slave, kind of equal to but not as a servant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7225)|
| 2:00:34| Everything that I've ever done, everything that I've put goals up for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7234)|
| 2:00:40| is to make somebody else's life a little bit easier, a little bit better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7240)|
| 2:00:45| It may be a little painful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7245)|
| 2:00:47| but once we get to the other side of that bridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7247)|
| 2:00:50| you're going to be benefited by it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7250)|
| 2:00:54| Through the position that I'm standing here today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7254)|
| 2:00:56| and hopefully be selected to sit up there with you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7256)|
| 2:00:59| is to make that one person, if it's one person in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7259)|
| 2:01:02| to make their life a little bit easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7262)|
| 2:01:05| By the end of the day, if I can make them smile,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7265)|
| 2:01:08| if I can make them say, hey, I can make it another 24 hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7268)|
| 2:01:11| that's why I want to be up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7271)|
| 2:01:14| You made the statement that there's a lot of waste in Knox County government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7274)|
| 2:01:17| I believe those are your words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7277)|
| 2:01:18| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7278)|
| 2:01:19| Where is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7279)|
| 2:01:21| We're going to hopefully be asked this question in the cars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7281)|
| 2:01:25| the use of the vehicles, county vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7285)|
| 2:01:29| In California, we had the same issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7289)|
| 2:01:31| And that's another thing that I think that I can bring to the table up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7291)|
| 2:01:35| The stuff that you see out in California, it's coming this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7295)|
| 2:01:39| And that's why I want to stop it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7299)|
| 2:01:42| When you say stuff, what do you mean by that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7302)|
| 2:01:47| Back in 2001 when we first moved here, my daughter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7307)|
| 2:01:52| who's now she's going to be graduating UT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7312)|
| 2:01:56| she was given a reading assignment by the Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7316)|
| 2:02:00| It was approved by the Knox County School Board of a book that was approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7320)|
| 2:02:11| My daughter came down and she said that she wasn't very comfortable in reading this book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7331)|
| 2:02:17| We read it, and it was not appropriate for the school district to be putting out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7337)|
| 2:02:25| I went to the school district, the school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7345)|
| 2:02:29| and asked them how did this book, which I felt was pornographic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7349)|
| 2:02:34| got into the hands of my student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7354)|
| 2:02:38| You said Knox County School Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7358)|
| 2:02:40| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7360)|
| 2:02:41| Knox County School Board, or did you mean the California School Board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7361)|
| 2:02:45| No, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7365)|
| 2:02:46| This is Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7366)|
| 2:02:47| This was here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7367)|
| 2:02:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7368)|
| 2:02:49| And one thing led to another, and they pulled the book off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7369)|
| 2:02:57| There's waste that's out there, talking about the cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7377)|
| 2:03:02| Out in California, we were going through the same thing a number of years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7382)|
| 2:03:07| And we pull cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7387)|
| 2:03:10| We didn't take cars home, or they didn't take cars home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7390)|
| 2:03:14| The use of the cell phones and BlackBerrys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7394)|
| 2:03:17| We didn't have BlackBerrys back then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7397)|
| 2:03:19| The phones were huge, but they were audited, and they were not used for personal use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7399)|
| 2:03:25| There's a time and a place for it because you can make a phone call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7405)|
| 2:03:30| and have a situation rectified right then and there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7410)|
| 2:03:34| But there's not really a big need in taking cars home unless, you know, you're a detective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7414)|
| 2:03:43| or, you know, you need to respond from the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7423)|
| 2:03:46| That can be cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7426)|
| 2:03:52| Commissioner Lambert here recently had a very good suggestion about unplugging the fax machine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7432)|
| 2:04:01| Excellent idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7441)|
| 2:04:03| How many times do you sit by a fax machine and some restaurant menu comes up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7443)|
| 2:04:12| Well, that may be just one piece of paper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7452)|
| 2:04:14| but how many times is that happening in the government all over here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7454)|
| 2:04:18| You don't necessarily need to have a piece of paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7458)|
| 2:04:20| E-mail is excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7460)|
| 2:04:23| So little things like that can be cut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7463)|
| 2:04:26| everything from the pens you use to the pieces of paper that you write on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7466)|
| 2:04:33| Government contracts need to consistently be gone through line by line, office by office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7473)|
| 2:04:41| person by person, and you can cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7481)|
| 2:04:46| When I was hired at my current position now, I went into the position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7486)|
| 2:04:53| They said, here it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7493)|
| 2:04:54| Usually in any job that I've ever been into,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7494)|
| 2:04:59| there's always been somebody I could go to and I could say, hey, how do you do this job?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7499)|
| 2:05:03| How do you do this job?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7503)|
| 2:05:05| Well, the unique position that I'm in right now, the facility that I work at is unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7505)|
| 2:05:11| The only one that's closest to it is up in Flint, Michigan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7511)|
| 2:05:15| When I first sat down in that office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7515)|
| 2:05:18| based on my experience and the stuff that my dad had taught me all my life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7518)|
| 2:05:22| is that every little penny counts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7522)|
| 2:05:25| So I went line by line, item by item, contract by contract at where I'm at right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7525)|
| 2:05:31| Within, I think it was within 30, 45 days, I saved the office $12,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7531)|
| 2:05:41| Six months from just going through supplies and how we were using it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7541)|
| 2:05:50| and staff usage and time, I saved a bunch of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7550)|
| 2:05:57| So just because of how we're doing it now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7557)|
| 2:06:00| or how government is done now doesn't mean that's how we can continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7560)|
| 2:06:05| There's a whole bunch of stuff we can cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7565)|
| 2:06:07| All it takes is just somebody to look line by line, item by item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7567)|
| 2:06:11| and a penny saved is a penny saved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7571)|
| 2:06:16| Mr. Ross, I want to ask you about being the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7576)|
| 2:06:19| That's Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7579)|
| 2:06:23| I'm so bored with that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7583)|
| 2:06:24| I'm going to completely surprise you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7584)|
| 2:06:28| You say you've watched hours of us, presumably, on video.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7588)|
| 2:06:32| You too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7592)|
| 2:06:33| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7593)|
| 2:06:35| I don't know whether to express admiration or condolence, but let me put it this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7595)|
| 2:06:39| You've seen us in action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7599)|
| 2:06:41| Which sitting commissioner is most like your political philosophy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7601)|
| 2:06:44| and which one is least?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7604)|
| 2:06:51| Now, you all are voting if I get this, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7611)|
| 2:06:59| Commissioner Strickland would probably be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7619)|
| 2:07:05| Can I change that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7625)|
| 2:07:06| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7626)|
| 2:07:08| We were at a meeting not too long ago at Fun-A-Thon, the kickoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7628)|
| 2:07:18| And he was up there and he made a statement up there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7638)|
| 2:07:20| and he was talking about where he was, where he is now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7640)|
| 2:07:24| and where he is planning to go on his personal life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7644)|
| 2:07:27| And I think his experiences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7647)|
| 2:07:34| and what I have seen kind of go side to side, along with Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7654)|
| 2:07:42| Excellent man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7662)|
| 2:07:43| I've seen him work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7663)|
| 2:07:46| Good guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7666)|
| 2:07:48| Now, what was the second part?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7668)|
| 2:07:49| No, I'm not answering that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7669)|
| 2:07:56| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7676)|
| 2:08:00| Stephen, I enjoyed having breakfast with you the other day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7680)|
| 2:08:04| I learned a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7684)|
| 2:08:05| I was pretty rough on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7685)|
| 2:08:07| You know, I threw some things out there for you to be thinking about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7687)|
| 2:08:11| and, you know, hopefully you've had time to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7691)|
| 2:08:14| But I went away with a good feeling about you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7694)|
| 2:08:16| You're a good, solid individual and I want to compliment you on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7696)|
| 2:08:21| For the Seventh District, what goals do you see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7701)|
| 2:08:24| or I'm sorry, what are the issues that you see for the Seventh District specifically?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7704)|
| 2:08:31| I think the issues at Seventh District are the ones that are the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7711)|
| 2:08:35| that are held by Knox County and the nation as a whole, or in a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7715)|
| 2:08:44| People are worried.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7724)|
| 2:08:47| They're worried about their jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7727)|
| 2:08:49| They're worried about if they're going to be able to have food on their table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7729)|
| 2:08:52| They're worried about their family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7732)|
| 2:08:56| I think for Knox County and the Seventh District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7736)|
| 2:09:00| we have to position ourselves of where we think globally but plan locally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7740)|
| 2:09:05| I think we can do that through planning, long-range forecast planning to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7745)|
| 2:09:14| that every little step that we take, that we make, will be a benefit for each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7754)|
| 2:09:20| and every citizen, not only for the Seventh District but for Knox County as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7760)|
| 2:09:25| What I would like to see, I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7765)|
| 2:09:27| You can't think of anything in particular for the Seventh District?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7767)|
| 2:09:31| What I'm getting at is how familiar are you with the Seventh District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7771)|
| 2:09:35| and the issues that just pertain to the Seventh District?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7775)|
| 2:09:38| What community buildings do we have in the Seventh District that the county owns?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7778)|
| 2:09:42| Where are our parks and things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7782)|
| 2:09:44| What do you see that you would have an input on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7784)|
| 2:09:47| Well, for having 41 parks encompassing almost 3,000 acres of park usage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7787)|
| 2:09:55| and having visitors of almost up to 2 million people that visited the parks in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7795)|
| 2:10:00| I don't know where each individual one is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7800)|
| 2:10:03| But for the Seventh District, I think the Emory Corridor, the buildup of that area there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7803)|
| 2:10:11| the safety of the children because we're starting to have a rise of criminal activity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7811)|
| 2:10:16| that goes on out there, that needs to be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7816)|
| 2:10:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7822)|
| 2:10:23| Specifically, what have you done for the Seventh District yourself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7823)|
| 2:10:26| I would say up to the 27th of December, I was an active deacon for the First Baptist Church of Powell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7826)|
| 2:10:33| I stepped down off the active role because I don't think I could have served both those areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7833)|
| 2:10:41| to the fullest of my ability if I was selected for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7841)|
| 2:10:47| I've provided transportation for an Iraqi family, trying to find jobs for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7847)|
| 2:10:58| They're refugees from the war.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7858)|
| 2:11:01| We've secured housing for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7861)|
| 2:11:03| We've secured employment for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7863)|
| 2:11:06| We've taken their family gifts at Christmas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7866)|
| 2:11:09| We've taken them shopping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7869)|
| 2:11:13| We've fed the homeless in the downtown area, provided in-home care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7873)|
| 2:11:20| and maintenance for an elderly couple that my wife is currently working with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7880)|
| 2:11:27| Co-started a neighborhood watch program for our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7887)|
| 2:11:36| I've been a PTO member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7896)|
| 2:11:38| I've coached my son's baseball team and other members of that team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7898)|
| 2:11:45| I'm a member of the touchdown club for the Powell High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7905)|
| 2:11:50| On a couple occasions, I've, through our church, have prayer walked our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7910)|
| 2:11:59| talked about the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7919)|
| 2:12:02| I went to some instances that were occurring on the school bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7922)|
| 2:12:07| I made contact with the owner and rectified some situations that were going on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7927)|
| 2:12:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7936)|
| 2:12:18| I meant to mention for Steve and for you too, Stephen, I appreciate your military service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7938)|
| 2:12:24| I appreciate both of you gentlemen doing that and what you've done for our country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7944)|
| 2:12:28| You talked about the $12,000 that was implemented on the savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7948)|
| 2:12:33| Was that put into savings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7953)|
| 2:12:36| You did the budget cuts and you found some $12,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7956)|
| 2:12:40| Did they implement what you did or suggested?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7960)|
| 2:12:43| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7963)|
| 2:12:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7964)|
| 2:12:45| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7965)|
| 2:12:47| That was just one small area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7967)|
| 2:12:49| I've had the highest budget line item that I've had to deal with was $21 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7969)|
| 2:12:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7979)|
| 2:13:00| And any experience with zonings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7980)|
| 2:13:02| Any experience with zonings, residential or commercial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7982)|
| 2:13:05| Only personally, not on a board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7985)|
| 2:13:10| From business that we had in Powell, there was some issues with zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7990)|
| 2:13:14| and things that we've had to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7994)|
| 2:13:17| Currently, I'm in we are in the planning stages for opening up a couple more clinics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=7997)|
| 2:13:25| and there's some, I'm sure, some zoning things that come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8005)|
| 2:13:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8009)|
| 2:13:30| And would you be able to make six to eight meetings a week throughout the weekday plus meetings at night?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8010)|
| 2:13:35| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8015)|
| 2:13:36| And on Saturdays?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8016)|
| 2:13:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8017)|
| 2:13:39| I tried to look at the voting record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8019)|
| 2:13:42| But I trust you that you're a regular voter on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8022)|
| 2:13:46| Will you vote on every issue that comes before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8026)|
| 2:13:52| If I know every fact of an item that is up for vote and if I am in agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8032)|
| 2:14:04| if the constituents that I represent are for that bill or item that comes up for vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8044)|
| 2:14:16| I will vote for what the public wants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8056)|
| 2:14:18| And probably somebody here is thinking, well, how are you going to know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8058)|
| 2:14:22| If I am selected to fill the seat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8062)|
| 2:14:28| I will immediately set up town hall meetings throughout the 7th District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8068)|
| 2:14:37| in different locations throughout the month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8077)|
| 2:14:39| and get the immediate feedback from the people that I represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8079)|
| 2:14:47| Will you do what you say for constituents?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8087)|
| 2:14:50| I wouldn't be here today if I didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8090)|
| 2:14:52| I think you would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8092)|
| 2:14:53| And you wouldn't be able to work for the police department if you had a felony,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8093)|
| 2:14:56| so I don't need to ask you that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8096)|
| 2:14:59| Intake center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8099)|
| 2:15:00| Do you have any ideas on the intake center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8100)|
| 2:15:04| I've read quite a many articles about the intake center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8104)|
| 2:15:08| I've heard pros and cons about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8108)|
| 2:15:13| On the very face of it, it sounds like a savings to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8113)|
| 2:15:21| It sounds like a safe thing to do due to the transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8121)|
| 2:15:27| I've heard a lot of people up here discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8127)|
| 2:15:29| where they would want to get their information from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8129)|
| 2:15:31| or who they'd want to talk to and talk to the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8131)|
| 2:15:35| In addition to that, I would want to talk to the deputies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8135)|
| 2:15:39| I would want to talk to the people that do that route every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8139)|
| 2:15:43| I would want to get their feedback of what do you think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8143)|
| 2:15:49| Because, as we all know, sometimes the communications from the street to the top man| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8149)|
| 2:15:56| doesn't always get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8156)|
| 2:15:59| I take everybody's word of what they say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8159)|
| 2:16:04| There's no wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8164)|
| 2:16:07| But I think where you get the realistic information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8167)|
| 2:16:13| is that information that comes from the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8173)|
| 2:16:15| Not saying that the sheriff doesn't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8175)|
| 2:16:18| He may know, or I'm sure he does know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8178)|
| 2:16:20| but the feeling and the nuances of how that needs to come about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8180)|
| 2:16:25| probably get a very good picture from talking to the people that are on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8185)|
| 2:16:32| I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8192)|
| 2:16:33| Views on your take-home cars and free parking, cell phones?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8193)|
| 2:16:39| For those individuals that need their car, and depending on their task,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8199)|
| 2:16:47| if they're called out from home, they're on duty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8207)|
| 2:16:51| They need that car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8211)|
| 2:16:53| For those people who are doing it out of convenience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8213)|
| 2:16:57| or doing it out of, well, this is my right or this is my office, absolutely not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8217)|
| 2:17:04| If we are asking to cut the school budget and we still are driving cars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8224)|
| 2:17:14| those cars need to be parked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8234)|
| 2:17:16| That way we can set the bar a little higher for those school kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8236)|
| 2:17:20| and give them the opportunity to make it and to fulfill their dreams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8240)|
| 2:17:30| That would be a reason to park those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8250)|
| 2:17:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8254)|
| 2:17:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8255)|
| 2:17:37| Thank you, Mr. Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8257)|
| 2:17:39| I want to know one, Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8259)|
| 2:17:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8262)|
| 2:17:43| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8263)|
| 2:17:43| Somebody else has asked this, and I'm just curious about California.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8263)|
| 2:17:46| So just was it a state government set of issues from the state government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8266)|
| 2:17:53| that finally did you in and pushed you this way, or what was it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8273)|
| 2:17:57| Oh, and what part of California are you from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8277)|
| 2:18:00| I'm from, well, I was born down in L.A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8280)|
| 2:18:04| I was raised up in Northern California, up in the sticks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8284)|
| 2:18:08| And I worked in Central California.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8288)|
| 2:18:11| I've worked all over the place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8291)|
| 2:18:16| There wasn't one set issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8296)|
| 2:18:18| It was a preponderance of issues that kept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8298)|
| 2:18:26| There were the big three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8306)|
| 2:18:28| Well, there's a whole bunch of stuff that's going out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8308)|
| 2:18:30| And some of the stuff I could tell you, you probably know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8310)|
| 2:18:33| but it would just absolutely curl your hair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8313)|
| 2:18:37| California is a wonderful place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8317)|
| 2:18:39| It's absolutely a beautiful place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8319)|
| 2:18:45| But it wasn't the place for me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8325)|
| 2:18:47| and it wasn't the place that I wanted to raise my family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8327)|
| 2:18:51| The issues that were coming up was it's unlike here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8331)|
| 2:19:02| And the best way that I can relay this to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8342)|
| 2:19:06| out there in California, to me, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8346)|
| 2:19:09| it was everybody was driving for the almighty dollar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8349)|
| 2:19:13| You didn't know your neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8353)|
| 2:19:15| You came home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8355)|
| 2:19:16| You parked in the garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8356)|
| 2:19:17| You went in the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8357)|
| 2:19:19| One time, we were repairing our carpet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8359)|
| 2:19:21| We had our carpet out in the front yard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8361)|
| 2:19:24| where we parked cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8364)|
| 2:19:26| We had it open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8366)|
| 2:19:27| Our neighbor drove over our new carpet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8367)|
| 2:19:29| just to get to her garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8369)|
| 2:19:33| That's one little thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8373)|
| 2:19:35| Since the early 80s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8375)|
| 2:19:37| we were vacationing out here every other year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8377)|
| 2:19:39| Every two years, we'd come out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8379)|
| 2:19:41| What impressed me the most is that on one vacation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8381)|
| 2:19:47| I was going through the line at the checkout counter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8387)|
| 2:19:51| and the checkout person saw that I was buying a hunting license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8391)|
| 2:19:55| or a fishing license or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8395)|
| 2:19:57| and she saw that I was from California.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8397)|
| 2:20:02| And right then, she wanted to know all about me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8402)|
| 2:20:06| where I was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8406)|
| 2:20:07| She knew more about me within 5 to 10 minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8407)|
| 2:20:10| than both my neighbors did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8410)|
| 2:20:12| in the years that I lived out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8412)|
| 2:20:15| That's what I want to preserve here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8415)|
| 2:20:18| The wave is coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8418)|
| 2:20:20| I want to stop it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8420)|
| 2:20:21| I want to stop what I see is going wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8421)|
| 2:20:25| I want to help, and I want to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8425)|
| 2:20:28| I just want to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8428)|
| 2:20:31| Don't worry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8431)|
| 2:20:32| We're not going to let them take over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8432)|
| 2:20:34| Get at the border.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8434)|
| 2:20:37| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8437)|
| 2:20:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8440)|
| 2:20:41| I just wanted to say I know many of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8441)|
| 2:20:43| in fact, all of you have tried to contact me over the last several weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8443)|
| 2:20:47| and I apologize for not being available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8447)|
| 2:20:50| but we have one more week or so before our next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8450)|
| 2:20:56| And if you all would mind coming up here before you leave tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8456)|
| 2:21:00| I've got my calendar with me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8460)|
| 2:21:03| and I would love to take each of you to the time warp for coffee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8463)|
| 2:21:07| to get to know you a little bit better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8467)|
| 2:21:09| I appreciate what I've heard tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8469)|
| 2:21:11| but I'd like to get you all to know you all a little bit better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8471)|
| 2:21:14| So if you'll please see me on your way out so that we can arrange that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8474)|
| 2:21:19| I would appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8479)|
| 2:21:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8481)|
| 2:21:24| Thank you, Mr. Ralph.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8484)|
| 2:21:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8486)|
| 2:21:27| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8487)|
| 2:21:30| I want to take this opportunity to thank each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8490)|
| 2:21:32| and every one of you for stepping up to have the opportunity to replace Scott Morrow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8492)|
| 2:21:39| at 7B seat 7, 7B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8499)|
| 2:21:44| I know everyone has someone here that supports them, family member, friend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8504)|
| 2:21:52| but I'm going to give you an opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8512)|
| 2:21:55| You don't have to take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8515)|
| 2:21:57| Anyone from the audience would like to say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8517)|
| 2:22:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8522)|
| 2:22:03| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8523)|
| 2:22:06| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8526)|
| 2:22:08| And we're just going to take a minute or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8528)|
| 2:22:10| Very brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8530)|
| 2:22:12| Well, this is going to be very brief because I'm a retired Knox County schoolteacher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8532)|
| 2:22:16| and everybody knows that retired Knox County schoolteachers have to be in bed by 930.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8536)|
| 2:22:23| So anyway, my name is Caroline Cowan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8543)|
| 2:22:26| I live at 7004 Imperial Drive in Halls in the 7th District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8546)|
| 2:22:33| and I am here to speak about my friend of 30 years, Michelle Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8553)|
| 2:22:39| And I will make this very, very brief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8559)|
| 2:22:42| and try to give you some highlights of what I know about her in the 30 years that I have known her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8562)|
| 2:22:48| I first met Michelle in the fall of 1979.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8568)|
| 2:22:54| I was a teacher at Central High School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8574)|
| 2:22:57| and she was in her fall semester of her senior year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8577)|
| 2:23:02| Now, it's often said that teachers remember those students that are really, really, really good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8582)|
| 2:23:08| or those that are really, really, really bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8588)|
| 2:23:12| Well, Michelle was indeed one of those that was really, really good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8592)|
| 2:23:17| She was so vivacious, so full of energy, and so anxious to get involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8597)|
| 2:23:23| Even back then at the age of 17,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8603)|
| 2:23:27| I saw in her a lot of leadership ability and a lot of enthusiasm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8607)|
| 2:23:34| After she graduated from Central and she went on to college,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8614)|
| 2:23:38| we continued to stay in touch with each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8618)|
| 2:23:42| And then later on, we both would work together in the Akeema Club of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8622)|
| 2:23:46| And I think Michelle told you a little bit about what Akeema does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8626)|
| 2:23:51| We worked on many, many Akeema projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8631)|
| 2:23:54| Dogwood Arts Festival, Sunshine Shelter, Children's Hospital, Ronald McDonald,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8634)|
| 2:24:00| just to name a few of the things we worked on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8640)|
| 2:24:03| I watched Michelle, and I watched her leadership, and I watched her love of people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8643)|
| 2:24:09| and I knew that when she was helping people in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8649)|
| 2:24:13| that it really made her a happy person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8653)|
| 2:24:15| Now, as time moved on, the year became 1999,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8655)|
| 2:24:21| and I had the opportunity to see Michelle in another role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8661)|
| 2:24:26| This time, she was a parent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8666)|
| 2:24:28| She was the mother of one of my students, her daughter Christy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8668)|
| 2:24:34| And Michelle was the type of parent that every educator would love to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8674)|
| 2:24:41| If the schools were full of parents like Michelle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8681)|
| 2:24:44| then we as educators would have such a much easier time dealing with our students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8684)|
| 2:24:51| and we would have, and being in education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8691)|
| 2:24:54| She would initiate projects to do anything that would make the school a better place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8694)|
| 2:25:00| not just for her children, for other children as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8700)|
| 2:25:05| Okay, then several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8705)|
| 2:25:09| Am I not interesting to you all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8709)|
| 2:25:14| Well, this brings me to my wrap-up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8714)|
| 2:25:20| I know that the person that you select is someone that you hope will be able to work with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8720)|
| 2:25:25| very cooperatively and diligently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8725)|
| 2:25:28| And I really think that Michelle will do a wonderful job, and I know that she will work hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8728)|
| 2:25:35| She has a lot of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8735)|
| 2:25:37| Her work ethic is wonderful, and she's like me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8737)|
| 2:25:41| She likes to talk, but she also likes to listen, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8741)|
| 2:25:45| So I would like, I would appreciate it if you all would think about supporting my friend, Michelle Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8745)|
| 2:25:53| As a member of the 7th District, I would be pleased to have her represent me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8753)|
| 2:25:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8758)|
| 2:26:00| You have a question, Commissioner Burroughs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8760)|
| 2:26:03| Actually, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8763)|
| 2:26:04| This is something I wanted to bring up real quick because I know everybody's anxious to go home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8764)|
| 2:26:09| And I'm sorry, it's not a question for you, but thank you for what you said about Michelle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8769)|
| 2:26:14| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8774)|
| 2:26:15| Our committee meetings are on Inauguration Day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8775)|
| 2:26:19| and there is some special events going on that morning honoring some Knoxvillians| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8779)|
| 2:26:26| who have been leaders in the civil rights movement here in Knoxville, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8786)|
| 2:26:33| as well as some people who have worked with Dr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8793)|
| 2:26:39| I would like to make a motion, if it's appropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8799)|
| 2:26:41| to move our committee meetings, intergovernmental and finance, to the next day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8801)|
| 2:26:47| if this room is available so that we can attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8807)|
| 2:26:51| Those of us who want to can attend that event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8811)|
| 2:26:54| I believe it starts at nine, and then the inauguration of our new president is at noon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8814)|
| 2:27:02| Well, go ahead, Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8822)|
| 2:27:05| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8825)|
| 2:27:07| A suggestion, and I was going to bring this up a little later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8827)|
| 2:27:09| but I'll just go ahead and talk about it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8829)|
| 2:27:12| The Judicial Subcommittee is going to be meeting at 2 o'clock in this room that same day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8832)|
| 2:27:20| and we're going to hear, like today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8840)|
| 2:27:23| we're going to hear from those folks that are interested in the Judicial Commission spots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8843)|
| 2:27:28| We have three spots, and we have several candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8848)|
| 2:27:34| Maybe it's possible to delay the committees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8854)|
| 2:27:41| maybe even possibly combine the committees so that we can move them back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8861)|
| 2:27:45| but still keep them on the 20th if we can't move the date, if Wednesday is not available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8865)|
| 2:27:53| But I do want to make sure that, like tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8873)|
| 2:27:59| next Tuesday at 2 is the only opportunity you commissioners are going to have to hear from those judicial applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8879)|
| 2:28:09| So don't think that it's just a committee meeting at 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8889)|
| 2:28:14| Every commissioner, this is your opportunity to hear from those prospective appointees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8894)|
| 2:28:21| I think most of the festivities will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8901)|
| 2:28:23| or everybody will be taking a nap, getting ready for the evening festivities by then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8903)|
| 2:28:28| So I don't mind the 2 o'clock meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8908)|
| 2:28:30| It's the two early ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8910)|
| 2:28:33| Well, we have our meetings on separate days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8913)|
| 2:28:37| Couldn't we just combine them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8917)|
| 2:28:40| Well, this month they actually are on the same day because Monday is Martin Luther King Jr. Day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8920)|
| 2:28:46| and they moved both of them to Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8926)|
| 2:28:49| I believe finance is set for 8.30 and intergovernmental at 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8929)|
| 2:28:55| I was just thinking, you know, maybe it's possible we just go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8935)|
| 2:28:58| and combine the two at, you know, maybe at noon or.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8938)|
| 2:29:04| Or do them both at 8 and be out by 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8944)|
| 2:29:07| Or try to combine them both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8947)|
| 2:29:08| I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8948)|
| 2:29:10| Yeah, like that's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8950)|
| 2:29:14| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8954)|
| 2:29:15| We have confirmation of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8955)|
| 2:29:17| That would only give Joe Lee two days to get her packet ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8957)|
| 2:29:25| I'm hearing it could be the best interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8965)|
| 2:29:29| Maybe we can combine the two meetings for 8.30 that morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8969)|
| 2:29:34| It's going to be awful hard to put it off to Wednesday because if we put it off to Wednesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8974)|
| 2:29:38| I don't think Joe Lee could get everything together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8978)|
| 2:29:40| It does make it a hardship for her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8980)|
| 2:29:41| Yeah, from the law director and everything to put it together to get it out to us by Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8981)|
| 2:29:46| And I know there's several commissioners that will not be here anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8986)|
| 2:29:49| I know at least three, maybe four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8989)|
| 2:29:54| So combining both meetings at 8.30 that morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8994)|
| 2:29:59| I'd like a motion that we combine the two committees at 8.30 on the 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=8999)|
| 2:30:06| I have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=9006)|
| 2:30:08| I would like to say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=9008)|
| 2:30:11| Being the chairman of the BZA and chairman of the finance committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=9011)|
| 2:30:15| I had Mr. Harmon run it last month, the BZA, and I thought he'd done a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=9015)|
| 2:30:21| I asked Mr. Wright to run the finance committee this month to give them a little experience in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=9021)|
| 2:30:28| They're both our vice chairs in case something happens, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=9028)|
| 2:30:32| And I'll go along with that motion, but I'd like to amend it for Mr. Wright to chair the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=9032)|
| 2:30:38| You know, whoever wants to chair, I'm just going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=9038)|
| 2:30:42| You know, because I did that and he has been working towards it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=9042)|
| 2:30:47| Well, we don't need a motion for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=9047)|
| 2:30:48| You can just let him sit in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=9048)|
| 2:30:50| But can I get a second to Commissioner Lutho's motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=9050)|
| 2:30:54| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=9054)|
| 2:30:55| Properly moved and second to have the meeting, combine the meetings on the 20th at 8.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=9055)|
| 2:31:00| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=9060)|
| 2:31:01| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=9061)|
| 2:31:02| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=9062)|
| 2:31:03| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=9063)|
| 2:31:04| Is there anyone else from the audits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=9064)|
| 2:31:05| Just real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=9065)|
| 2:31:06| Don't forget the 2 o'clock, though, on the 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=9066)|
| 2:31:11| Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=9071)|
| 2:31:12| Oh, yeah, 2 o'clock for the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=9072)|
| 2:31:14| The subcommittee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=9074)|
| 2:31:15| That's our only opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=9075)|
| 2:31:16| Because we have to appoint those on the 26th, that Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=9076)|
| 2:31:20| Also, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=9080)|
| 2:31:21| So that's your only opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=9081)|
| 2:31:26| Name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=9086)|
| 2:31:29| My name is Ashley Carter and I am the daughter of Steve Ross's oldest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=9089)|
| 2:31:33| and I live at 404 Taney Drive, apartment E28 in Powell, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=9093)|
| 2:31:39| I just wanted to take a moment and just talk about my dad real quick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=9099)|
| 2:31:43| and just how proud I am of him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=9103)|
| 2:31:45| And it's easy for someone to get up here and say all these wonderful things about what he will do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=9105)|
| 2:31:50| or what she won't do or what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=9110)|
| 2:31:52| I wasn't able to sit in everything because my baby was crying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=9112)|
| 2:31:56| But I know for a fact that my father does what he says when he talks about how he sacrifices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=9116)|
| 2:32:02| My dad has always sacrificed for our family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=9122)|
| 2:32:05| We make fun of him at night for going to bed at 8 o'clock in the morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=9125)|
| 2:32:08| but he gets up to go to his work about an hour and a half before anyone else shows up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=9128)|
| 2:32:13| He opens the doors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=9133)|
| 2:32:14| At night he comes home and he's on the computer researching everything about government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=9134)|
| 2:32:18| everything that's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=9138)|
| 2:32:20| He is the most honest person I've ever met in my entire life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=9140)|
| 2:32:23| and he, to my knowledge, has never done a single thing wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=9143)|
| 2:32:31| Even for, I mean, talking about speeding tickets in California,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=9151)|
| 2:32:34| when he was following or when he was enforcing the law, he would not go over one speeding limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=9154)|
| 2:32:39| He goes by exactly what he says by the law of the word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=9159)|
| 2:32:43| And I want just to stay in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=9163)|
| 2:32:45| I know that you might think I'm kind of biased because I am his daughter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=9165)|
| 2:32:48| but I have never seen anything on his behalf that he would do anything to jeopardize his position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=9168)|
| 2:32:55| anything that would make him seem hypocritical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=9175)|
| 2:32:58| My father is the most honorable person that I know, and I'm proud for him to be doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=9178)|
| 2:33:03| And I just want you guys to take that time to really, when he puts things on his resume,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=9183)|
| 2:33:08| he's serious about what he wants to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=9188)|
| 2:33:10| and he would take the opportunity to meet you all and to get to know you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=9190)|
| 2:33:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=9195)|
| 2:33:17| Is there anyone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=9197)|
| 2:33:19| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=9199)|
| 2:33:20| Mr. Chairman, as to the combined meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=9200)|
| 2:33:23| I'd just like to remind the members of Intergovernmental that we have been delaying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=9203)|
| 2:33:30| a reorganization of that committee for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=9210)|
| 2:33:33| So that's an item that we need to take up early in that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=9213)|
| 2:33:38| And that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=9218)|
| 2:33:39| I mean, that doesn't affect the combination of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=9219)|
| 2:33:42| But I'd just like to remind them of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=9222)|
| 2:33:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=9226)|
| 2:33:48| I think I won't be here, so Commissioner Luthor will be able to hold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=9228)|
| 2:33:54| Tony, why don't we kick that off another month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=9234)|
| 2:33:56| Yeah, I was going to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=9236)|
| 2:33:58| We may be getting another member of that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=9238)|
| 2:34:00| But I think the ruling states that the Chairman should handle all the elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=9240)|
| 2:34:06| So I'm not going to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=9246)|
| 2:34:07| And I'm asking Commissioner Luthor to hold the election part of that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=9247)|
| 2:34:12| That's all I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=9252)|
| 2:34:14| Mr. Norman, you may want to delay that because whoever comes on from this seventh district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=9254)|
| 2:34:20| will be the replacement for Scott on that one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=9260)|
| 2:34:23| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=9263)|
| 2:34:24| You need to wait and maybe postpone that until next month where they could have a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=9264)|
| 2:34:27| I think that would be also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=9267)|
| 2:34:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=9269)|
| 2:34:31| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=9271)|
| 2:34:32| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=9272)|
| 2:34:33| Well, I guess that ends our evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=9273)|
| 2:34:36| To the candidates, remember that we're going to select one of you at 2 o'clock on the 26th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=9276)|
| 2:34:42| That's going to be the first thing out to shoot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=9282)|
| 2:34:44| So be here so you can be sworn in and you'll be able to take your seat at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=9284)|
| 2:34:51| This meeting is over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090115candidateforum?start=9291)|
