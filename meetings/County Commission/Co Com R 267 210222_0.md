| 0:07:27| Okay. Let me explain for you and the others that are here under item 5. Our procedures today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=447)|
| 0:07:36| are that the sheriff or some officer from Knox County will present the complaint they have where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=456)|
| 0:07:45| they have alleged that you have violated the beer ordinance. So we will hear first from that officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=465)|
| 0:07:53| and he or she will explain what he or she believes to be the facts. Afterwards, you will then be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=473)|
| 0:08:01| to take the stand, as it were, and either admit or deny the allegations that have been put forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=481)|
| 0:08:08| And you will be able to add to and explain anything you want to prior to this office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=488)|
| 0:08:16| turning it back over to the full commission for their review and questions of you. Do you understand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=496)|
| 0:08:22| Yes, sir. Okay. Is there somebody from the sheriff's office here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=502)|
| 0:08:27| Yes, sir. Would you say, please, for the record, what the complaint that you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=507)|
| 0:08:32| filed in this matter? Yes, sir. On January 18, 2021,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=512)|
| 0:08:39| Knox County Sheriff's Office conducted an underage compliance check| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=519)|
| 0:08:43| at the Super Stop Market on East Beaver Creek. We sent in an underage person. They were able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=523)|
| 0:08:51| move alcohol, go to the register, and they purchased alcohol without their ID being checked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=531)|
| 0:08:57| and exited the location. Ms. Stooksbury, did you hear and understand the allegations from that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=537)|
| 0:09:06| officer? Yes, sir, I did. All right. Do you admit or deny those allegations? I admit, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=546)|
| 0:09:14| Do you have any testimony you would like to present to this beer board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=554)|
| 0:09:18| at this time before they take over the case and examine your case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=558)|
| 0:09:23| I understand that it did happen, and I do apologize for that. I was very surprised that it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=563)|
| 0:09:30| happened, but due to the fact that she's about the only employee that I've had through all the COVID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=570)|
| 0:09:36| and stuff that's been going on through the past year. So, all I can say is I apologize,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=576)|
| 0:09:43| and it will not happen again because I've been talking with the top shelf, and we're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=583)|
| 0:09:50| get everyone recertified again because of all the COVID. Last year, we weren't able to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=590)|
| 0:09:57| plus I didn't have enough employees at the time. So, we're going to do whatever we can to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=597)|
| 0:10:02| not ever let this happen again. Thank you, ma'am. I will now defer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=602)|
| 0:10:07| and turn this over to the chairman. Thank you, Director Book. If you would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=607)|
| 0:10:13| Officer Lawson, if you would please identify yourself just for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=613)|
| 0:10:16| Yes, sir. Matt Lawson, Lieutenant with the Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=616)|
| 0:10:20| Thank you. I'll now look to the District 7 Commissioner for a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=620)|
| 0:10:25| Thank you, Mr. Chair. Mr. Stokesberry, it kind of pains me to have to do this, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=625)|
| 0:10:30| that is the thing since the law was broken. But I use your market. I appreciate it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=630)|
| 0:10:36| and I appreciate you being in business in the 7th District. But having the violation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=636)|
| 0:10:41| I make a motion that we either have the $1,000 fine, or you can read, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=641)|
| 0:10:51| I make a motion for the $1,000 fine. Second, Biggs. Just a point of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=651)|
| 0:11:02| Commissioner Busser, that's above what's outlined as a first offense item. Is that what you wish to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=662)|
| 0:11:08| do? I thought that was what we normally did with $1,000. You have to give the option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=668)|
| 0:11:14| Yeah. The first offense under the Beer Board rules, the first offense gives the violator a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=674)|
| 0:11:19| choice between either a 30-day suspension or a $500 fine. Okay. We'll do the $500 fine or the 30-day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=679)|
| 0:11:26| You have to give the applicant a choice. Okay. So, Ms. Stokesberry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=686)|
| 0:11:31| I would do the $500 fine, sir. Okay. All right. So, if you could restate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=691)|
| 0:11:36| the motion, Commissioner Busser. I believe our, historically, this body on first offenses has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=696)|
| 0:11:46| been a $1,000 fine or 30-day suspension of the beer license. That is our prerogative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=706)|
| 0:11:56| Yeah. It's the prerogative of any commissioner to make a motion. I'm just reading what is outlined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=716)|
| 0:12:02| in our, as a guideline. So, Mr. Chairman. Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=722)|
| 0:12:06| When this was first done, we had the $5,000, $1,500. And we, for some reason, we set a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=726)|
| 0:12:13| precedence back some time ago that it was $1,000. And that's what we normally did as a body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=733)|
| 0:12:23| even though what is written down there, but the precedence was set for $1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=743)|
| 0:12:27| Okay. You can make, if you'd like to make that motion, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=747)|
| 0:12:31| Yes. As we've done in the past, and we've done all the others, it's $1,000 for a 30-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=751)|
| 0:12:38| I'll make the motion. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=758)|
| 0:12:41| Second. Second to the motion. Second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=761)|
| 0:12:43| from Commissioner Schoonmaker, first with Commissioner Bussler. Is there any further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=763)|
| 0:12:48| discussion on the item? Seeing none. Madam Clerk, would you please call the vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=768)|

| 0:14:50| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=890)|

| 0:15:10| underage compliance check at 2064 C-A-S-T-A-I-C Lane. We sent an underage person in to purchase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=910)|
| 0:15:16| alcohol. They selected the alcohol, walked up to the register. The defendant, in that case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=916)|

| 0:15:29| alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=929)|

| 0:16:06| So, but other than that, that's all that we're trying to enforce and reinforce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=966)|
| 0:16:13| and showing how important it is to ID everyone every time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=973)|
| 0:16:20| But hopefully, it won't ever happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=980)|

| 0:17:36| Is it the state training or is it your office training?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=1056)|
| 0:17:38| Yes. It's actually the state training is top shelf, but I've also printed a few things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=1058)|
| 0:17:43| offline to have them reinforced. So, we're trying to make sure and I'm also watching video to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=1063)|
| 0:17:49| ensure that they are IDing every time and reviewing the dates because our system records| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=1069)|
| 0:17:55| every date that's put in the system. So, I'm making sure they're not just typing in something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=1075)|
| 0:17:59| random and to be more like, sorry, I'm trying to think, to be more accurate and not just getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=1079)|

| 0:22:33| sale. It wasn't a fake ID or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=1353)|

| 0:46:06| do have an off topic or an off agenda item for the second half. Then we'll jump into the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=2766)|
| 0:46:11| as presented. As I've outlined tonight to run a show, do I hear any objections?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=2771)|

| 0:47:42| so they would go right there, but they stay as a to be added this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=2862)|

| 0:52:36| been reverent, stereotyped, and vilified from the days of slavery until now. Whereas it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=3156)|

| 1:08:16| important for the child and the family to just, for the child to see there are people rooting for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=4096)|

| 1:13:49| Which also brings up the 14th Amendment. So now I get to see you on the 5th, the 6th, the 14th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=4429)|
| 1:13:56| and under three state statutes that y'all would have to violate just to use this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=4436)|

| 1:14:10| The second thing, and again, I love questions about this, is this so-called funding out of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=4450)|
| 1:14:15| surplus. If you will take a look at your budget, you will see that the county in 2020 actually has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=4455)|
| 1:14:21| $2 million less in revenue than it did in the previous year. Take that drop in revenue, right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=4461)|
| 1:14:29| and if we just fund everything at current levels, we have a $2 million deficit. But to find a $1.5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=4469)|
| 1:14:36| million surplus on top of that, you had to cut existing programs. $3.5 million is the deficit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=4476)|
| 1:14:47| that we have, not $1.5 million surplus. What you have is a $2 million shortfall in revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=4487)|
| 1:14:54| plus $1.5 million cuts in existing funding. This includes funding for projects that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=4494)|
| 1:15:00| in existence, like the Family Justice Center, which is completely defunded under the current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=4500)|

| 1:15:13| okay, totally defunded under this project. For what? So that we can have better TVs to do court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=4513)|

| 1:37:37| That's a revised caption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=5857)|
| 1:37:39| I read it from the resolution and not the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=5859)|

| 1:37:51| Is there a motion on item number 25?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=5871)|
| 1:37:53| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=5873)|

| 1:38:06| That gets us to a discussion point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=5886)|
| 1:38:07| I'm going to first call on Public Defender, Mr. Eric Ludden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=5887)|
| 1:38:12| I'm going to provide you five minutes to address Commission, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=5892)|
| 1:38:16| If we can have that timer back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=5896)|
| 1:38:18| Although we may have comments and questions, I'm going to give you both, you and Mr. Hammond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=5898)|
| 1:38:24| five minutes each as we did in public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=5904)|
| 1:38:28| So, Mr. Ludden, if you would please state your name and your department in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=5908)|
| 1:38:32| and you have five minutes to address Commission, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=5912)|
| 1:38:35| My name is Eric Ludden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=5915)|
| 1:38:36| I'm the Knox County Public Defender.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=5916)|
| 1:38:38| I largely kind of presented my issues last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=5918)|
| 1:38:42| I wanted to sign up to speak again this week for a couple of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=5922)|
| 1:38:46| One, I was asked a question last Tuesday when I spoke by one of the commissioners about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=5926)|
| 1:38:53| whether or not I agreed with the $100,000 savings number that it would, that this proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=5933)|
| 1:39:00| facility would supposedly save the taxpayers each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=5940)|
| 1:39:03| And at that time, I had not heard that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=5943)|
| 1:39:06| You know, I was learning that for the first time, and so I was not able to intelligently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=5946)|
| 1:39:09| speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=5949)|
| 1:39:10| And since I had been asked that question, I wanted to try and look into that a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=5950)|
| 1:39:13| bit so I could provide an answer from a perspective of someone who's working in the court system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=5953)|
| 1:39:19| And I think that that number, if the information I've gotten is correct, then I would dispute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=5959)|
| 1:39:24| that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=5964)|
| 1:39:26| What I have been told by a third party where that number is coming from is that currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=5966)|
| 1:39:32| the sheriff's department spends about $135,000 a year in fuel costs in their transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=5972)|
| 1:39:37| division, and that the estimate is that roughly 65 to 70 percent of those fuel costs that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=5977)|
| 1:39:43| are spent each year are for transportation of inmates back and forth from the Roger E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=5983)|
| 1:39:48| Wilson Detention Facility and the city county building, which does come out to about $100,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=5988)|
| 1:39:53| But I think it's important to note, as this is looked at from a financial perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=5993)|
| 1:39:58| that this facility being built would not mean that individuals would not be going to court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=5998)|
| 1:40:03| anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6003)|
| 1:40:04| It doesn't cut the transportation costs from everybody going all the way down to nobody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6004)|
| 1:40:08| going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6008)|
| 1:40:09| It would, under Rule 43, would potentially result in some additional arraignments being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6009)|
| 1:40:16| conducted out of the detention facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6016)|
| 1:40:19| And then, of course, if there was a change in Rule 43, which I know was mentioned as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6019)|
| 1:40:23| a possibility that some people are moving for that at a statewide level, however, if that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6023)|
| 1:40:30| rule were to be changed, we, one, would have no idea what it would look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6030)|
| 1:40:33| But two, under the Tennessee Constitution, there's only so much they could tweak the rule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6033)|
| 1:40:38| because there's plenty of case law on point about the individual, about the fact that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6038)|
| 1:40:42| somebody has a right to confront their accuser face to face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6042)|
| 1:40:47| So I think any time you were having any sort of a hearing or witnesses were present, there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6047)|
| 1:40:51| no way to modify the rule where that's not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6051)|
| 1:40:52| So I still think that you're talking about the vast majority of individuals would still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6052)|
| 1:40:57| be being transported.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6057)|
| 1:40:59| And so I think that if the information that I've gotten is accurate, then I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6059)|
| 1:41:03| $100,000 number would be significantly, significantly smaller than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6063)|
| 1:41:09| The only other thing that I wanted to speak to, I had gotten a question from a commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6069)|
| 1:41:14| that perhaps I did not do a very good job of explaining something last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6074)|
| 1:41:18| And so I wanted to talk about how there's sometimes a benefit to the taxpayers that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6078)|
| 1:41:25| individuals are brought to court, specifically on those low-level misdemeanors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6085)|
| 1:41:30| Basically, what happens, like, let's say that you have somebody arrested for public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6090)|
| 1:41:33| intoxication on Saturday night, and the magistrate decides not to release them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6093)|
| 1:41:37| That individual, as it would stand outside of COVID times, would be brought to misdemeanor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6097)|
| 1:41:44| court for their arraignment on that, typically on that Monday in court, where a plea offer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6104)|
| 1:41:48| would be presented, and they would have the option to typically accept a time-served offer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6108)|
| 1:41:53| which gets them out of custody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6113)|
| 1:41:56| If they were to modify Rule 43 to allow pleas to take place, I'm sorry, as it currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6116)|
| 1:42:02| stands, you cannot take pleas remotely, except for under the current Supreme Court COVID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6122)|
| 1:42:08| order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6128)|
| 1:42:08| That's the only reason we're able to take pleas remotely currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6128)|
| 1:42:10| So what I think would end up happening is you'd have this very large number of category| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6130)|
| 1:42:15| of clients that are charged with low-level misdemeanors that are getting out when they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6135)|
| 1:42:19| having their initial appearance in court, or rather their arraignment in court, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6139)|
| 1:42:23| if we were to not transport those individuals, what happens is you don't transport them Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6143)|
| 1:42:28| but then you're going to have to transport them Tuesday or Wednesday, and the taxpayers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6148)|
| 1:42:31| are going to eat that $70-some a day that they're going to sit in custody for longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6151)|
| 1:42:37| And so you've not eliminated the transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6157)|
| 1:42:39| You have just moved it a day or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6159)|
| 1:42:42| And those were the issues that I wanted to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6162)|
| 1:42:45| I wanted to try and answer the question that was posed to me last week and try and provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6165)|
| 1:42:48| a better explanation of what I was trying to say last week on the misdemeanor pleas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6168)|
| 1:42:52| but then also wanted to make myself available in case anyone had any questions for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6172)|
| 1:42:59| Thank you, Mr. Lutton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6179)|
| 1:43:00| I feel kind of hanging in the on-deck circle here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6180)|
| 1:43:02| If there are questions, we will get to those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6182)|
| 1:43:06| Well, we could actually, if there's any questions for Mr. Lutton, we could actually address those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6186)|
| 1:43:10| now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6190)|
| 1:43:10| I think he'll stay with us through the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6190)|
| 1:43:13| But is there any questions immediately from any commissioners before I go to Mr. Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6193)|
| 1:43:20| I'm not seeing any hands up, so hang with us, Mr. Lutton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6200)|
| 1:43:25| And Mr. Hammond, if you would please state your name and your department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6205)|
| 1:43:29| and you have five minutes to address commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6209)|
| 1:43:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6211)|
| 1:43:31| I'm Mike Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6211)|
| 1:43:32| Knox County Criminal Court Clerk, 400 Main Street, number 149.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6212)|
| 1:43:36| I've made some notes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6216)|
| 1:43:37| I'm going to be referring to my notes here as I give you some information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6217)|
| 1:43:40| As you know, I sent you an email last week, which outlined a lot of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6220)|
| 1:43:45| And I don't want to go into all of that again, because I'm sure that you have read that and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6225)|
| 1:43:49| you kind of have a good feel for what we were trying to portray to you in terms of numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6229)|
| 1:43:55| both for juvenile, for the magistrates, what is happening in some other states,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6235)|
| 1:43:59| and what is going on in Chattanooga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6239)|
| 1:44:01| They already have a video courtroom for each of their criminal divisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6241)|
| 1:44:05| and they've had it even before the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6245)|
| 1:44:07| But I would like to make call attention to one of the things that was in that email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6247)|
| 1:44:12| And that is from the Supreme Court rule on February 12,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6252)|
| 1:44:16| 21, which paragraph 7, which said, judges are charged with the responsibility of ensuring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6256)|
| 1:44:21| that core constitutional functions and rights are protected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6261)|
| 1:44:26| Now, having a video courtroom is not going to change that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6266)|
| 1:44:28| It is up to the judges to make sure that the rights are protected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6268)|
| 1:44:33| And today, I sent you an email from the three criminal judges and the five general sessions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6273)|
| 1:44:40| judges, they all signed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6280)|
| 1:44:42| And I would call your attention to a couple of paragraphs there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6282)|
| 1:44:45| which I think are extremely important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6285)|
| 1:44:48| They go to say that there are certain types of court appearances that will always require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6288)|
| 1:44:52| that the defendant appear in the courtroom in person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6292)|
| 1:44:56| Yes, you do have a right to face your accuser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6296)|
| 1:44:59| Children are not involved in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6299)|
| 1:45:00| They're out of the juvenile facility, and they're right next door to the courtroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6300)|
| 1:45:03| So children are an entirely different type situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6303)|
| 1:45:08| However, this email goes on to say, however, it's estimated that thousands of inmates every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6308)|
| 1:45:13| year are scheduled for appearances in Knox County Court that can easily be done over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6313)|
| 1:45:18| a video link with the court in accordance with the law and the Constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6318)|
| 1:45:24| We're talking about administrative type hearings, arraignments, those types of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6324)|
| 1:45:29| Yes, you have a right to face your accuser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6329)|
| 1:45:31| There will be many instances where people will be brought to court, and we will have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6331)|
| 1:45:35| trials and hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6335)|
| 1:45:36| Now, this email goes on to say, in order to facilitate timely video appearances and clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6336)|
| 1:45:41| communication, I want to mention clear communication because, as I mentioned last time, Judge Irwin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6341)|
| 1:45:47| has been doing this for two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6347)|
| 1:45:48| And what they do is they take a laptop, they take it into the pod, and they try to communicate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6348)|
| 1:45:53| via Skype.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6353)|
| 1:45:54| And so you've got noise, you've got people yelling, you've got all kinds of noise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6354)|
| 1:45:58| It's not very conducive to conducting a hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6358)|
| 1:46:00| So these folks have an opportunity and should have an opportunity to have a quiet place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6360)|
| 1:46:05| where they can communicate with the folks who are doing this video arraignment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6365)|
| 1:46:09| And the same thing goes with the magistrates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6369)|
| 1:46:13| And so it goes on to say, clear communication between the defendant and his or her attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6373)|
| 1:46:17| The proposed video facility at the Knox County Detention Facility is a necessity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6377)|
| 1:46:23| Such a resource will be used well beyond the end of the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6383)|
| 1:46:27| So they're on record as saying that it's going to be used beyond the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6387)|
| 1:46:32| Let me mention a couple of other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6392)|
| 1:46:33| And I was pleased to hear Mrs. Held say that her clients have gone to the Family Justice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6393)|
| 1:46:38| Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6398)|
| 1:46:39| I'm the board president of the Family Justice Center, and I'm glad to hear her say that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6399)|
| 1:46:43| people are being served there and receiving the services that they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6403)|
| 1:46:46| Funding for the Family Justice Center has not been cut by Knox County or the city of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6406)|
| 1:46:51| Knoxville, both which provide funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6411)|
| 1:46:53| Knox County takes care of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6413)|
| 1:46:55| And if there's anything that goes wrong with that building, we call Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6415)|
| 1:46:58| They come and fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6418)|
| 1:46:59| And the city of Knoxville has not cut their funding as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6419)|
| 1:47:02| But I'd also like to say that I sat in your seat for a number of years, and I'm glad that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6422)|
| 1:47:07| you all are there now instead of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6427)|
| 1:47:09| I'm enjoying the job that I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6429)|
| 1:47:11| I cannot tell you the number of times that we as a commission were threatened with lawsuits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6431)|
| 1:47:16| And so I know that you were threatened with lawsuits here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6436)|
| 1:47:19| I will tell you again, the judges have said their responsibility is to make sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6439)|
| 1:47:24| constitutional rights are protected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6444)|
| 1:47:27| They have put that in writing for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6447)|
| 1:47:29| And so I guess that what I would like to do is just close by saying you have your juvenile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6449)|
| 1:47:35| court judge in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6455)|
| 1:47:37| Your magistrates are in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6457)|
| 1:47:39| You have your three criminal judges that are in favor, calling it a necessity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6459)|
| 1:47:44| Five sessions judges are in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6464)|
| 1:47:46| Your criminal court clerk is in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6466)|
| 1:47:48| I would add this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6468)|
| 1:47:49| I talked with Judge McMillan in Fourth Circuit on Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6469)|
| 1:47:52| He says that they bring in about 10 to 50 inmates per month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6472)|
| 1:47:56| By having this would help him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6476)|
| 1:47:58| He actually has to fight for time now because I believe we have two cameras out there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6478)|
| 1:48:02| I'm talking about six video courtrooms, which is going to help expedite things a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6482)|
| 1:48:06| There's no question that this is going to provide savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6486)|
| 1:48:09| But my point is, we're elected officials, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6489)|
| 1:48:12| And so it's our responsibility to come to you and say, we believe we have an efficient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6492)|
| 1:48:17| means that's going to help the process, that is going to be a long term, something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6497)|
| 1:48:22| will be learned going on long term, even past the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6502)|
| 1:48:26| And so we answer the taxpayers just like you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6506)|
| 1:48:28| And so we're here asking you for this because, as the judges said, we believe it's a necessity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6508)|
| 1:48:33| And I'm not sure how much time I have left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6513)|
| 1:48:35| Do I have about a minute, Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6515)|
| 1:48:38| You don't, but I'll go ahead and give you one because I imagine there'll be some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6518)|
| 1:48:42| And then I am going to get to one of our public speakers that was in the forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6522)|
| 1:48:46| But go ahead and wrap it up, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6526)|
| 1:48:48| My last minute is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6528)|
| 1:48:50| How did this all come about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6530)|
| 1:48:52| I think that's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6532)|
| 1:48:53| We have been having meetings for several months of what we call the stakeholders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6533)|
| 1:48:56| That's the judges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6536)|
| 1:48:58| That's the DA, public bar, the public defender, the clerks, the sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6538)|
| 1:49:05| We've been having meetings for months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6545)|
| 1:49:07| And this issue of not having the ability to do remote hearings has been brought up several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6547)|
| 1:49:13| times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6553)|
| 1:49:13| And so three or four months ago, it was brought up that, can we do something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6553)|
| 1:49:17| Is there something we can do to help provide a better means of communication, a better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6557)|
| 1:49:23| means of having these remote hearings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6563)|
| 1:49:25| And so at that point, the sheriff came back with a proposal and says, I believe we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6565)|
| 1:49:29| build a facility at the detention center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6569)|
| 1:49:31| And at that time, the stakeholder said, let's let's let's go for it and let's see if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6571)|
| 1:49:37| can do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6577)|
| 1:49:38| And so that's how it all came about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6578)|
| 1:49:39| It wasn't something that just came up last week or last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6579)|
| 1:49:43| This is something we have been talking about for several weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6583)|
| 1:49:46| And so that's why we're presenting it to you now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6586)|
| 1:49:48| We really feel that this is something that will be helpful in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6588)|
| 1:49:52| And Mr. Jay, let me also mention one other thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6592)|
| 1:49:54| I have my chief deputy Richard Major here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6594)|
| 1:49:57| I'm not a lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6597)|
| 1:49:58| He can get into the weeds and answer any questions that you might have in the weeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6598)|
| 1:50:01| And so I just wanted you to know that he is available to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6601)|
| 1:50:04| But thank you so much for giving me the chance to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6604)|
| 1:50:06| Thank you very much, Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6606)|
| 1:50:08| And stand by with your team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6608)|
| 1:50:10| I'm going to before we open up for more conversation amongst the commissioners, I'm going to call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6610)|
| 1:50:15| on our last public forum member who had this as an item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6615)|
| 1:50:19| We had a little technical difficulty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6619)|
| 1:50:20| So we're going to try one last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6620)|
| 1:50:22| Call on Sarah McDonald.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6622)|
| 1:50:24| And I just spoke with her a few moments ago, and she was having technical difficulties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6624)|
| 1:50:29| And OK, well, we tried three times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6629)|
| 1:50:32| So here she is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6632)|
| 1:50:34| OK, if we can get her in, let's see if we can get her in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6634)|
| 1:50:36| And if so, we'll hear from her and we will then proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6636)|
| 1:50:41| Ms. McDonald.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6641)|
| 1:50:56| Ms. McDonald, are you with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6656)|
| 1:50:59| I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6659)|
| 1:51:01| Oh, there you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6661)|
| 1:51:01| MS. MCDONALD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6661)|
| 1:51:02| Yay, thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6662)|
| 1:51:04| CHAIR BAILET No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6664)|
| 1:51:05| If you would, please state your name and your county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6665)|
| 1:51:09| And you have five minutes if you're unable to see the screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6669)|
| 1:51:12| Are you able to see the screen or no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6672)|
| 1:51:14| MS. MCDONALD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6674)|
| 1:51:15| I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6675)|
| 1:51:15| I'm a dial in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6675)|
| 1:51:16| CHAIR BAILET You have five minutes, and I will give you a warning with one minute left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6676)|
| 1:51:20| MS. MCDONALD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6680)|
| 1:51:21| Awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6681)|
| 1:51:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6681)|
| 1:51:23| OK, well, I am Sarah McDonald.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6683)|
| 1:51:26| I am in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6686)|
| 1:51:29| And obviously, I have a few problems with my ability to connect to Internet or phone access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6689)|
| 1:51:35| for Zoom meetings, which is why I am opposing this measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6695)|
| 1:51:40| The public has a wide range of abilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6700)|
| 1:51:44| And although I am generally a competent person, being a survivor of domestic abuse has left| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6704)|
| 1:51:53| me in a situation where I am unable to access what would be normal Internet, normal communications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6713)|
| 1:52:00| for the average person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6720)|
| 1:52:02| As a matter of fact, this is something that's a horrible, slippery slope for people who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6722)|
| 1:52:07| are working in the juvenile justice system, who are working with the courts, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6727)|
| 1:52:15| I am expected to, I'm expected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6735)|
| 1:52:18| CHAIR BAILET I think the technical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6738)|
| 1:52:29| difficulties are going to get ahead of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6749)|
| 1:52:32| Jacob, if you would just, I'm sorry, Ms. McDonald, that the technical difficulties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6752)|
| 1:52:36| are not going to allow us to hear from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6756)|
| 1:52:38| So, Jacob, if you would maybe just remove that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6758)|
| 1:52:42| We'll start by opening up to questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6762)|
| 1:52:44| I see Commissioner Daley first and then Commissioner Biggs, if you would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6764)|
| 1:52:50| Go ahead, Mr. Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6770)|
| 1:52:51| MR. DALEY Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6771)|
| 1:52:53| I would like to give the opportunity to Sheriff Spangler and our law department to make any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6773)|
| 1:53:00| comments on the speakers and especially the Sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6780)|
| 1:53:03| And I'll turn it over to you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6783)|
| 1:53:07| CHAIR BAILET Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6787)|
| 1:53:08| Commissioner Sheriff Spangler, are you with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6788)|
| 1:53:12| MR. SPANGLER I am, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6792)|
| 1:53:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6794)|
| 1:53:14| CHAIR BAILET If you would just identify yourself and go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6794)|
| 1:53:18| MR. SPANGLER I'm Spangler, North County Sheriff, 400 Main Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6798)|
| 1:53:22| I'm not sure where to start, other than maybe I can clarify some things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6802)|
| 1:53:27| I think that obviously the bus that's sitting on top of me is pretty heavy right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6807)|
| 1:53:31| I say that in a joking manner, but I'm also serious about the fact that I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6811)|
| 1:53:36| with what was going on, I think when I presented this to the stakeholders, I thought maybe this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6816)|
| 1:53:44| was a good idea, and I still think it's a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6824)|
| 1:53:48| But I guess I'm the mouthpiece for the whole group, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6828)|
| 1:53:53| And but this commission will make their decision on how they feel things are going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6833)|
| 1:54:01| I am for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6841)|
| 1:54:03| I understand that there are some questions, and I understand that people have some concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6843)|
| 1:54:08| about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6848)|
| 1:54:09| But I don't think that it seems like we jumped into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6849)|
| 1:54:13| But as Mr. Hammond said, we've been talking about this for quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6853)|
| 1:54:17| And maybe I should have come up with it a long time ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6857)|
| 1:54:20| But I guess my slowness, or whatever you want to call it, just didn't catch on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6860)|
| 1:54:24| And when I proposed that this could possibly happen out there, I was looking for a remedy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6864)|
| 1:54:31| for all of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6871)|
| 1:54:34| This is a minimal, if you will, for the Knox County Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6874)|
| 1:54:38| I'm not standing up here advocating this just for the Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6878)|
| 1:54:43| There is no way that I would come to this commission and ask them for $1.5 million for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6883)|
| 1:54:48| something I think that would be fruitless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6888)|
| 1:54:49| And I think I've told you all that from the very beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6889)|
| 1:54:53| This is something that came from a group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6893)|
| 1:54:55| And here I am as the mouthpiece for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6895)|
| 1:54:57| And I think Mike Hammond put it very eloquently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6897)|
| 1:55:02| This is something that is definitely needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6902)|
| 1:55:05| Now, you've got both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6905)|
| 1:55:06| There's always two sides to the story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6906)|
| 1:55:09| And you're going to hear both sides, and you've heard both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6909)|
| 1:55:13| And that's for you all to determine how you want to go with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6913)|
| 1:55:17| I think what it does, it does help within us bringing people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6917)|
| 1:55:22| Mr. Hammond mentioned in that memo, yeah, the judges are going to be the ones who decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6922)|
| 1:55:28| how much they use this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6928)|
| 1:55:29| That will be up to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6929)|
| 1:55:31| Some of the question was, is it going to be used after the pandemic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6931)|
| 1:55:35| From what I hear from several of the judges, they absolutely want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6935)|
| 1:55:39| And that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6939)|
| 1:55:40| Some judges may say, well, we want to have more hearings back downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6940)|
| 1:55:44| Yeah, that's going to reduce if we have the hearings at the facility, in this new facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6944)|
| 1:55:51| Then, yeah, that's going to cut back on some of our trips or quite a bit of our trips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6951)|
| 1:55:55| Because what's going to be heard, 65% of the cases that are going to be heard virtually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6955)|
| 1:56:01| by video arraignment is going to be arraignments and plea deals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6961)|
| 1:56:05| It's not going to be trials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6965)|
| 1:56:06| They're not going to do trials on the internet, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6966)|
| 1:56:09| That's not going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6969)|
| 1:56:11| So I think there's a misconception there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6971)|
| 1:56:13| We just want to make sure that that's clear, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6973)|
| 1:56:17| I'm not sure what questions that I will have towards me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6977)|
| 1:56:20| I think the majority of them may come from Mr. Hammond or at least towards him and Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6980)|
| 1:56:27| Major and him being the attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6987)|
| 1:56:31| Like Mr. Hammond said, I'm sure anytime you get threatened with a lawsuit, and trust me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6991)|
| 1:56:35| I'm on the receiving end of many lawsuits right now just because of being the sheriff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6995)|
| 1:56:39| and you're running the jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=6999)|
| 1:56:40| Those happen on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7000)|
| 1:56:44| The judges would not sign off on something that they thought that they were violating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7004)|
| 1:56:48| somebody's rights of any kind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7008)|
| 1:56:50| I don't think that that's ever going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7010)|
| 1:56:53| So trust in me when I say that, look, this is something that I think that it's beneficial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7013)|
| 1:56:59| for all of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7019)|
| 1:57:00| It's not, I'm not coming to you as a sheriff saying the sheriff's office, just the sheriff's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7020)|
| 1:57:04| office needs this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7024)|
| 1:57:05| No, I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7025)|
| 1:57:06| I'm not doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7026)|
| 1:57:07| I'm doing this and I'm being the mouthpiece for all of the stakeholders that are involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7027)|
| 1:57:11| in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7031)|
| 1:57:12| And it, like I said, that bus sitting on my chest right now is pretty heavy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7032)|
| 1:57:16| So I'll leave it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7036)|
| 1:57:18| Thank you, Sheriff Spangler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7038)|
| 1:57:19| Commissioner Daley, you still have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7039)|
| 1:57:23| And you have the mute button to hit as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7043)|
| 1:57:27| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7047)|
| 1:57:28| I hate Zoom meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7048)|
| 1:57:31| Hey, Sheriff, have you talked to the sheriff of Hamilton County and got any information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7051)|
| 1:57:36| back from him how they've been doing video court for a couple of years now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7056)|
| 1:57:40| As a matter of fact, I was at the Tennessee Sheriff's Association last week with Paul| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7060)|
| 1:57:45| asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7065)|
| 1:57:45| Yes, I did talk to him about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7065)|
| 1:57:47| It's going very well for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7067)|
| 1:57:49| They've been using it quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7069)|
| 1:57:51| And as I mentioned, and as you said, we don't do any of them on trial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7071)|
| 1:57:57| We don't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7077)|
| 1:57:58| Obviously, you can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7078)|
| 1:57:59| We're not going to take away the rights of the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7079)|
| 1:58:02| I think part of what also this does, and I don't mean to get away from your question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7082)|
| 1:58:07| there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7087)|
| 1:58:07| I know I'm rambling a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7087)|
| 1:58:08| But what it does, too, is it gets those individuals back out of our facility quicker and gets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7088)|
| 1:58:14| them back to their families if that's where they're going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7094)|
| 1:58:17| They're not having to be brought down here for that hearing or that plea deal, taken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7097)|
| 1:58:21| back to the facility and then brought back to the city county building to be released| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7101)|
| 1:58:25| because that's the way it's supposed to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7105)|
| 1:58:27| So it does help on transporting that and getting those individuals back to their families and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7107)|
| 1:58:34| getting them out of the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7114)|
| 1:58:35| When they come downtown to this facility as well, there is what we call the slam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7115)|
| 1:58:40| And that's where the inmates are held until they are heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7120)|
| 1:58:43| And you talk about lawsuits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7123)|
| 1:58:46| That's one coming right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7126)|
| 1:58:48| Too many people in one area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7128)|
| 1:58:49| And we have to be able to keep them confined in one area and to be able to make sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7129)|
| 1:58:55| security is handled just as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7135)|
| 1:58:57| But yes, he's very happy the way things have been going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7137)|
| 1:59:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7140)|
| 1:59:02| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7142)|
| 1:59:03| Thank you, Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7143)|
| 1:59:06| Thank you, Chairman Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7146)|
| 1:59:07| I have a few questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7147)|
| 1:59:09| Number one, I was reading the resolution that's attached, and it's not the new resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7149)|
| 1:59:15| that we were presented last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7155)|
| 1:59:21| The resolution caption that was read and is attached, you're saying is not the same one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7161)|
| 1:59:26| that was sent out on Friday afternoon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7166)|
| 1:59:29| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7169)|
| 1:59:30| What is the difference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7170)|
| 1:59:33| Hang on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7173)|
| 1:59:34| I'll read it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7174)|
| 1:59:36| It was one sent out for commissioners, looks like 422 on Friday by Driscilla.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7176)|
| 1:59:47| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7187)|
| 1:59:48| The one that's attached to the agenda that doesn't speak anything about the second whereas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7188)|
| 1:59:52| where it states that the facility wouldn't be used for any other purpose other than virtual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7192)|
| 1:59:57| meetings or virtual court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7197)|
| 2:00:06| You're saying it doesn't have a whereas or that states that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7206)|
| 2:00:10| I know that's stated in the email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7210)|
| 2:00:14| Are you saying that you're looking for a whereas in the language?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7214)|
| 2:00:19| I'm sorry to, I just want to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7219)|
| 2:00:21| Yeah, I guess it was a friendly amendment for the new resolution, but it's not on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7221)|
| 2:00:26| language that we have attached to our working agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7226)|
| 2:00:29| So, is this the one that we're specifically voting on, or is it the new resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7229)|
| 2:00:35| I guess is my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7235)|
| 2:00:39| It would be the new one that was emailed out on Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7239)|
| 2:00:42| If it's not attached here, let's get that attached real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7242)|
| 2:00:46| If this is not the exact same one, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7246)|
| 2:00:49| We just had, it looks like a clear here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7249)|
| 2:00:52| I'm getting a note from Drew that says she's attaching it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7252)|
| 2:00:55| So, I'll go ahead with mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7255)|
| 2:00:58| Let's continue the kind of, I'll come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7258)|
| 2:01:00| Do you have additional questions while we do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7260)|
| 2:01:03| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7263)|
| 2:01:04| My second question was, I was trying to look through all the data that we were provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7264)|
| 2:01:09| that talks about maybe technical difficulties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7269)|
| 2:01:13| I mean, it's been stated tonight, we don't really overly care for all the things that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7273)|
| 2:01:18| going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7278)|
| 2:01:20| And this isn't going to be managed by Knox County IT, I would imagine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7280)|
| 2:01:24| So, it'll be managed by the Sheriff's Department IT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7284)|
| 2:01:27| Is that something as well as, I was kind of hoping that I would see something that states| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7287)|
| 2:01:33| how many prisoners we had let out during the COVID and how that went, as well as where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7293)|
| 2:01:39| the numbers are at the current moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7299)|
| 2:01:42| And do we expect those numbers to accelerate and come back into where they were pre-COVID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7302)|
| 2:01:47| numbers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7307)|
| 2:01:51| I'm not sure where to start by answering that, Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7311)|
| 2:01:55| What I will tell you is that we've got over 2,600 on pre-trial right now, which means| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7315)|
| 2:02:00| those are the people who, whenever they come in, they spend enough time in there to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7320)|
| 2:02:04| booked and they're back out of our facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7324)|
| 2:02:10| Before COVID hit, you had our facility out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7330)|
| 2:02:14| You're looking at times anywhere from 1,200 to 1,300 inmates, and we're down to, I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7334)|
| 2:02:19| it is 900, maybe 800 right now with that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7339)|
| 2:02:25| I think you heard last week or at least last month from Mr. Hammond saying that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7345)|
| 2:02:29| 18,000 cases now because of COVID that are backed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7349)|
| 2:02:35| So that's going to take some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7355)|
| 2:02:38| Who knows how long that's going to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7358)|
| 2:02:41| So that's what I have for you right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7361)|
| 2:02:43| Thank you, Sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7363)|
| 2:02:45| Is there anybody from IT that could answer my technical difficulties problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7365)|
| 2:02:50| Can you restate that question real quick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7370)|
| 2:02:52| So just like, you know, tonight, people having technical difficulties coming in through the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7372)|
| 2:02:57| lines and things of that nature and video feed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7377)|
| 2:03:00| I was just wanting to see, you know, where are we at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7380)|
| 2:03:03| Is that going to be an additional IT cost, things of that nature, like once this is established?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7383)|
| 2:03:13| Oh, I can speak to what I know, if that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7393)|
| 2:03:15| If you could just identify yourself and your department, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7395)|
| 2:03:18| Zach Webb, Knox County IT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7398)|
| 2:03:21| So my understanding is that that entire operation will be handled by the Sheriff's IT side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7401)|
| 2:03:26| Now, that said, we'll be interfacing with courtrooms at the CCB that is handled by Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7406)|
| 2:03:31| County IT proper, if that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7411)|
| 2:03:34| So it's kind of two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7414)|
| 2:03:34| We're already doing it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7414)|
| 2:03:36| This is just an expanded facility to do the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7416)|
| 2:03:40| Yeah, the main reason is, Mr. Webb, is I was just kind of wondering, you know, what happens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7420)|
| 2:03:46| if the feed's messed up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7426)|
| 2:03:47| Does that backlog us even more with courts and things of that nature?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7427)|
| 2:03:50| And just kind of make sure that we're not going to have a huge area where kinks are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7430)|
| 2:03:54| going to be placed in there for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7434)|
| 2:03:57| Yeah, I think from our side, from the courtroom side, the management in the CCB and the areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7437)|
| 2:04:02| here, no, because we already have that planned for, and we're already covered, and we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7442)|
| 2:04:07| doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7447)|
| 2:04:08| I would ask, you know, the Sheriff to, you know, Aaron Yarnell and the people on his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7448)|
| 2:04:13| side to speak to their need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7453)|
| 2:04:15| But as far as my side goes, we're covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7455)|
| 2:04:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7458)|
| 2:04:19| So also, you know, I know sometimes people break into meetings and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7459)|
| 2:04:24| We've seen it multiple times through Zoom conference calls throughout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7464)|
| 2:04:27| Is that also going to be protected by the Sheriff's Office so things of that nature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7467)|
| 2:04:31| don't happen in the middle of court?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7471)|
| 2:04:32| So the meeting itself is handled on the courtroom side, unless that's changed on the back end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7472)|
| 2:04:37| We use a secure internal platform for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7477)|
| 2:04:40| They're not public meetings like these Zoom meetings are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7480)|
| 2:04:43| The links, you're secured through our multi-factor authentication on the back end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7483)|
| 2:04:48| Mr. Chairman, if I might, if I might inject here on Mr. Biggs, Richard Major is here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7488)|
| 2:04:53| and he works very closely with IT on putting all this together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7493)|
| 2:04:56| If it's appropriate, I'd like for him to answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7496)|
| 2:04:59| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7499)|
| 2:04:59| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7499)|
| 2:05:00| If you could identify yourself and your department, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7500)|
| 2:05:05| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7505)|
| 2:05:06| Richard Major from Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7506)|
| 2:05:09| I currently serve as Magistrate and Administrator for the Criminal Courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7509)|
| 2:05:13| And one of my interesting jobs that we've taken on in the last year was working with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7513)|
| 2:05:17| Zach Webb's folks to set up the video court process that has been developed over the last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7517)|
| 2:05:23| year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7523)|
| 2:05:23| And first of all, I'd like to say that you cannot say enough good about Knox County IT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7523)|
| 2:05:29| and the hard work they have done in supporting the courts as we've begun to roll this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7529)|
| 2:05:33| out over these last many months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7533)|
| 2:05:36| To Commissioner Biggs' question a moment ago as to how the process is working and how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7536)|
| 2:05:44| individuals may break into a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7544)|
| 2:05:46| The Knox County Criminal Courts have been doing the vast majority of their work by video| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7546)|
| 2:05:51| through Microsoft Teams for most of the last nine months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7551)|
| 2:05:55| I have participated in, I wouldn't say the majority of, but a great number of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7555)|
| 2:06:00| conferences specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7560)|
| 2:06:01| I've administered many of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7561)|
| 2:06:03| And I am unaware of any case of anyone breaking into a meeting who was not invited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7563)|
| 2:06:07| The way that structure works is we set up a team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7567)|
| 2:06:12| That team is limited to the members that the court administrator or secretary allows into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7572)|
| 2:06:17| the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7577)|
| 2:06:18| That's usually a specific number of lawyers, in addition to a specific number of users| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7578)|
| 2:06:22| at the jail, as well as the judges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7582)|
| 2:06:25| You have to be a member to be allowed into the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7585)|
| 2:06:29| So that's how we control who gets in and who does not get in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7589)|
| 2:06:32| Thank you, Mr. Major.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7592)|
| 2:06:35| I will also note that the revised resolution has been uploaded to the online agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7595)|
| 2:06:42| And that is live now for your review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7602)|
| 2:06:45| Moving down the list, Mr. Smith, you have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7605)|
| 2:06:53| I believe, well, Commissioner Ward's hand is up before mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7613)|
| 2:06:57| But if he's okay, I'll go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7617)|
| 2:06:59| Sorry, I didn't, I just got him as I saw him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7619)|
| 2:07:02| So go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7622)|
| 2:07:04| You can go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7624)|
| 2:07:07| First question I have is, do we need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7627)|
| 2:07:12| change our motion to reflect this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7632)|
| 2:07:16| resolution that does have the language in it in the second whereas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7636)|
| 2:07:22| as opposed to what is on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7642)|
| 2:07:25| On the floor was the resolution off of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7645)|
| 2:07:28| Just a technical question there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7648)|
| 2:07:32| Second, I wanted to ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7652)|
| 2:07:37| Director Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7657)|
| 2:07:39| One of our public speakers referenced our financial situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7659)|
| 2:07:45| And she said that we were, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7665)|
| 2:07:48| a couple million dollars behind on revenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7668)|
| 2:07:52| I want you to address that, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7672)|
| 2:07:56| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7676)|
| 2:07:57| As we discussed at Finance Committee last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7677)|
| 2:08:02| and the documentation that you all received,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7682)|
| 2:08:04| and we went over at Chairman's briefing as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7684)|
| 2:08:07| our revenues in the general fund are $5.3 million higher through December| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7687)|
| 2:08:12| than they were last December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7692)|
| 2:08:15| Our expenses are about the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7695)|
| 2:08:18| Local option sales tax is up 4% over our five-year average| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7698)|
| 2:08:23| through that same time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7703)|
| 2:08:25| Property tax is up 6% over our five-year average| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7705)|
| 2:08:28| through that same time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7708)|
| 2:08:30| So we are trending well above what we had budgeted for in revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7710)|
| 2:08:37| I would tell you sales tax will probably get in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7717)|
| 2:08:41| more than $25 million more than what was budgeted for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7721)|
| 2:08:45| including schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7725)|
| 2:08:47| And then the bulk of that goes to schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7727)|
| 2:08:49| But no, from a financial standpoint, we are nowhere near a deficit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7729)|
| 2:08:54| We are in great financial shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7734)|
| 2:08:57| And we most definitely, as we sit here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7737)|
| 2:09:00| will have a budget surplus to end the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7740)|
| 2:09:04| So to be perfectly clear, nothing will be cut for this capital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7744)|
| 2:09:08| to do this capital project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7748)|
| 2:09:10| Nothing will be cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7750)|
| 2:09:12| And I would go back to what Mr. Hammond said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7752)|
| 2:09:16| I don't know where the information came from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7756)|
| 2:09:18| about cutting of the Family Justice Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7758)|
| 2:09:20| That is not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7760)|
| 2:09:22| We own the building that the Family Justice Center is in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7762)|
| 2:09:25| And we pay for that operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7765)|
| 2:09:28| It's about $150,000 annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7768)|
| 2:09:31| And so last year, as we did the budget process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7771)|
| 2:09:37| if you'll recall, we really didn't make drastic cuts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7777)|
| 2:09:41| We just reduced it to reflect what we were being told| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7781)|
| 2:09:44| from our peers in the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7784)|
| 2:09:46| as to what we could expect in revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7786)|
| 2:09:49| CHAIR BAILET Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7789)|
| 2:09:50| COMMISSIONER DALY Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7790)|
| 2:09:51| CHAIR BAILET Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7791)|
| 2:09:54| Back to your first question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7794)|
| 2:09:56| I think what you might be doing is offering a friendly amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7796)|
| 2:10:01| to Commissioner Daly that his motion be to approve the revised resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7801)|
| 2:10:06| Is that accurate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7806)|
| 2:10:08| Is that okay with you, Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7808)|
| 2:10:10| COMMISSIONER DALY It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7810)|
| 2:10:11| CHAIR BAILET And Commissioner Smith has a second on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7811)|
| 2:10:13| You're okay with that as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7813)|
| 2:10:15| Okay, we'll take that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7815)|
| 2:10:18| Commissioner Ward, you're up next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7818)|
| 2:10:20| COMMISSIONER WARD Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7820)|
| 2:10:21| I have two clarifying questions and then one actual question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7821)|
| 2:10:27| just so that I make sure I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7827)|
| 2:10:29| If any inmate requests to have an in-person court hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7829)|
| 2:10:32| they could have an in-person court hearing, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7832)|
| 2:10:34| COMMISSIONER DALY| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7834)|
| 2:10:40| Who wants to answer that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7840)|
| 2:10:42| COMMISSIONER WARD If the judge wants to provide that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7842)|
| 2:10:44| yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7844)|
| 2:10:44| So they would make their appeal to the judge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7844)|
| 2:10:46| and the judge would make that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7846)|
| 2:10:47| COMMISSIONER DALY| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7847)|
| 2:10:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7848)|
| 2:10:49| CHAIR BAILET Commissioner Lutton?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7849)|
| 2:10:51| COMMISSIONER LUTTON| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7851)|
| 2:10:52| Say, if I may, there are some where the courts would be required to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7852)|
| 2:10:56| Obviously, the judges are going to have some discretion on some things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7856)|
| 2:11:01| I do think a lot of this is speculative, though, because as it stands right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7861)|
| 2:11:06| Rule 43 only would allow for arraignments and initial appearances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7866)|
| 2:11:10| And so if that rule is changed at some point in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7870)|
| 2:11:14| we have no way of knowing what that rule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7874)|
| 2:11:17| how that would read if it were to be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7877)|
| 2:11:19| And so I don't know that I could answer that for certain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7879)|
| 2:11:25| because it sort of calls for an answer of something that hasn't come to pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7885)|
| 2:11:28| CHAIR BAILET Is the Supreme Court hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7888)|
| 2:11:30| anything about this anytime soon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7890)|
| 2:11:32| COMMISSIONER LUTTON| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7892)|
| 2:11:34| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7894)|
| 2:11:35| I mean, they have periodically been extending orders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7895)|
| 2:11:39| Our initial order from the Supreme Court dates back to March of last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7899)|
| 2:11:43| And at that time, they'd set an expiration of that order for a couple of months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7903)|
| 2:11:46| And then it just periodically, as it gets close to the expiration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7906)|
| 2:11:49| they extend it and they sometimes tweak it a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7909)|
| 2:11:53| As our numbers have gone up, sometimes they've made some changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7913)|
| 2:11:56| As COVID numbers have gone down, they've made other changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7916)|
| 2:11:59| For example, like suspension of jury trials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7919)|
| 2:12:01| We're not having jury trials right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7921)|
| 2:12:02| but those are going to start back up again soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7922)|
| 2:12:05| So I have no idea what the Supreme Court is going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7925)|
| 2:12:08| CHAIR BAILET Gotcha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7928)|
| 2:12:10| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7930)|
| 2:12:11| The second question I had was, we currently have three virtual courtrooms, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7931)|
| 2:12:16| And we'll be adding an additional six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7936)|
| 2:12:18| So we'll have nine virtual courtrooms in total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7938)|
| 2:12:21| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7941)|
| 2:12:22| COMMISSIONER HAMMOND| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7942)|
| 2:12:25| Mr. Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7945)|
| 2:12:26| COMMISSIONER HAMMOND| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7946)|
| 2:12:28| Yes, I'm going to let Mr. Major talk about that, because again, he's my IT guru.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7948)|
| 2:12:32| CHAIR BAILET Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7952)|
| 2:12:33| COMMISSIONER HAMMOND| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7953)|
| 2:12:36| Commissioner Ward, that is essentially correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7956)|
| 2:12:38| There are three available spaces with cameras,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7958)|
| 2:12:41| but it's important to note how those are distributed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7961)|
| 2:12:44| Obviously, the sheriff can speak to his facility better than I can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7964)|
| 2:12:46| but there are two rooms out of the detention facility on Maloneyville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7966)|
| 2:12:51| One of those, those are divided up by men and women, which is a limitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7971)|
| 2:12:55| The third is actually a small library space here downtown in this building that has a camera in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7975)|
| 2:13:02| CHAIR BAILET Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7982)|
| 2:13:02| COMMISSIONER HAMMOND| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7982)|
| 2:13:02| I wouldn't necessarily call that a full courtroom space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7982)|
| 2:13:04| but it is what we may do with if we have someone who's down in the jail currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7984)|
| 2:13:08| CHAIR BAILET So, are we going from...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7988)|
| 2:13:09| COMMISSIONER HAMMOND| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7989)|
| 2:13:11| As I understand the proposal, the six spaces out the Maloneyville facility would be larger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7991)|
| 2:13:19| and equipped in such a way to provide a more court-like experience for the individuals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=7999)|
| 2:13:24| rather than what is sometimes required now in these tiny spaces we have to make do with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8004)|
| 2:13:29| CHAIR BAILET Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8009)|
| 2:13:30| So, are we going from three to six, or are we going from three to nine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8010)|
| 2:13:33| COMMISSIONER HAMMOND| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8013)|
| 2:13:35| I think the answer is you're going from three to the capacity to nine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8015)|
| 2:13:40| but really six that are of a sufficient size to conduct a process the way it ought to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8020)|
| 2:13:44| CHAIR BAILET Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8024)|
| 2:13:45| So, if there is overflow, we do have the ability to go to nine if need be, is what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8025)|
| 2:13:49| COMMISSIONER HAMMOND| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8029)|
| 2:13:50| The issue has always been space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8030)|
| 2:13:51| It's not technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8031)|
| 2:13:52| It's having the physical space to do so and the place to isolate individuals from the rest of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8032)|
| 2:13:56| folks who are being detained so that you have the necessary level of quietness to conduct a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8036)|
| 2:14:01| proceeding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8041)|
| 2:14:01| CHAIR BAILET Understood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8041)|
| 2:14:02| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8042)|
| 2:14:03| My last question is from the one I'm reading from the resolution that there's already a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8043)|
| 2:14:11| contractor in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8051)|
| 2:14:13| Is that – I don't think I've seen that before in any other resolution that's ever come before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8053)|
| 2:14:18| me, at least in my limited time on commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8058)|
| 2:14:21| But is that normal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8061)|
| 2:14:22| And if so, are there blueprints and engineering specs and all that kind of stuff that are out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8062)|
| 2:14:26| there that we haven't gotten to see yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8066)|
| 2:14:28| And if so, what did the contract bid come in at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8068)|
| 2:14:32| What is – why is there a contractor already in this resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8072)|
| 2:14:38| Is there an RFI that went out that I don't know about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8078)|
| 2:14:40| COMMISSIONER HAMMOND| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8080)|
| 2:14:41| I think Mr. Myers or Mr. Caldwell might want to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8081)|
| 2:14:46| There are specs and drawings in the presentation online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8086)|
| 2:14:52| CHAIR BAILET That's out of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8092)|
| 2:14:53| COMMISSIONER HAMMOND| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8093)|
| 2:14:55| Mr. Caldwell or Mr. Myers, do either of you want to address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8095)|
| 2:15:00| MR. MYERS Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8100)|
| 2:15:03| Matt Myers, Knox County Procurement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8103)|
| 2:15:05| Yeah, I think in the new resolution, we did add a contract for construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8105)|
| 2:15:12| It does have a rendering of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8112)|
| 2:15:15| It also has a floor plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8115)|
| 2:15:18| More engineering documents will be forthcoming, obviously, for the construction of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8118)|
| 2:15:26| We wanted to go ahead and get the contract in place as well on this resolution just so we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8126)|
| 2:15:31| get going and get started and get the facility built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8131)|
| 2:15:35| The contractor is one of our term contractors through the Public Building Authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8135)|
| 2:15:42| They do contracts to certain levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8142)|
| 2:15:46| Shelton General Contractor has been a good contractor for Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8146)|
| 2:15:50| certainly more than capable to provide this service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8150)|
| 2:15:54| And, you know, unless Sheriff Spangler has any more to add,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8154)|
| 2:16:00| that's why you see a little bit of amended resolution from last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8160)|
| 2:16:04| CHAIR BAILET Is there a number they've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8164)|
| 2:16:06| given us already that they think the construction cost is going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8166)|
| 2:16:09| that's more accurate than just the general 1.5 cap?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8169)|
| 2:16:13| MR. CALDWELL Well, I haven't been given any figure other than the 1.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8173)|
| 2:16:19| And that's why we put in the contract that it is not to exceed 1.5 million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8179)|
| 2:16:24| I know Sheriff Spangler and some of his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8184)|
| 2:16:28| people have probably had a little bit more deeper conversation as they continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8188)|
| 2:16:32| to look at the site, look at the location of where the building is going to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8192)|
| 2:16:38| how we're connecting to the detention facility and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8198)|
| 2:16:42| Sheriff Spangler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8202)|
| 2:16:44| MR. CALDWELL Yes, Matt, you're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8204)|
| 2:16:48| And part of that is we went off of what our one prefab building that we have out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8208)|
| 2:16:53| there for our training facility was right at $750,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8213)|
| 2:16:57| And the PP&E, just to figure all of the rest of it in there, that's where that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8217)|
| 2:17:02| figure came from, Commissioner Ward. We wanted to make sure we didn't exceed anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8222)|
| 2:17:06| That way, when we come to you, letting you know that could come in even cheaper than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8226)|
| 2:17:11| OK, so do we have any competing bids?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8231)|
| 2:17:13| Are we just saying we're going to go with this guy and that's it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8233)|
| 2:17:15| MR. CALDWELL That's a question you'll have to ask, Mr. Myers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8235)|
| 2:17:19| I think that has to do with the RA contract that they have that will piggyback on yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8239)|
| 2:17:24| MR. MYERS That is correct, Sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8244)|
| 2:17:28| You know, the Sheriff's office came to us with this particular contract who had already looked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8248)|
| 2:17:32| at the property. And as I said, they are a term contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8252)|
| 2:17:36| They have done numerous projects for us. They are a very trusted, very secure contractor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8256)|
| 2:17:43| and I feel very good about Lynn Shelton or Shelton General Contractors performing the work here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8263)|
| 2:17:49| MR. CALDWELL Sure. I'm sure they're a great contracting company. I'm just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8269)|
| 2:17:53| the Sheriff just told me a building similar to it costs $750,000, and you're asking for double,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8273)|
| 2:17:58| and just having us write a blank check just doesn't sit particularly well with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8278)|
| 2:18:02| But I understand the situation also. That's all the questions I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8282)|
| 2:18:11| Okay, thank you, Commissioner Ward. Commissioner Lundy, you're up next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8291)|
| 2:18:14| COMMISSIONER LUNDY Well, thank you, Chairman Drake. I have a few constituents emailing me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8294)|
| 2:18:19| and I have a few questions. This is more about the justice of it and the human rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8299)|
| 2:18:25| Would this actually cut off public access and transparency within a judicial system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8305)|
| 2:18:30| And so, I might answer that. MR. GENERAL LUNDY Mr. Majors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8310)|
| 2:18:38| do you want to address that? Mr. Hammond said you were on the legal side of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8318)|
| 2:18:42| MR. HAMMOND I'm happy to, Mr. Chairman. I believe I'm happy to address that. As far as transparency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8322)|
| 2:18:49| and access to the courts, Commissioner, looking to a post-pandemic world where you will have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8329)|
| 2:18:56| open physical courtrooms, in the event that this video technology was used, people would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8336)|
| 2:19:03| access to the physical courtroom in the same way that they have always had access to a physical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8343)|
| 2:19:07| courtroom. They would be able to see the inmate in open court as they're discussing their case for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8347)|
| 2:19:14| arraignment or whatever other matter. The only difference would be that the inmate would not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8354)|
| 2:19:20| physically be in the room, but rather would be available by video. But it would still be open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8360)|
| 2:19:24| courts and open access in a way that it always was pre-pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8364)|
| 2:19:28| MS. TAYLOR Okay. Thank you. Another question. Will the individuals facing charges feel more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8368)|
| 2:19:35| isolated and less likely to assess resources and advice from their counsel on the behalf?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8375)|
| 2:19:40| So, I guess I'm saying, would they have that privacy to talk to their attorney?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8380)|
| 2:19:45| MR. GENERAL LUNDY Commissioner, obviously, I don't want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8385)|
| 2:19:51| venture a guess to how folks may feel or what their individual interpretation may be of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8391)|
| 2:19:56| situation. As far as access, though, they would have the same access to meeting with their lawyer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8396)|
| 2:20:02| prior to court as they would in an in-person appearance. That's really all I can say to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8402)|
| 2:20:09| answer that question. Mr. Lutton may have some thoughts on that as well, and the Sheriff can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8409)|
| 2:20:13| speak more to what their actual visitation process at the jail is. But merely having a process like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8413)|
| 2:20:20| an arraignment over video does not prohibit lawyers from meeting with their clients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8420)|
| 2:20:26| MS. TAYLOR But the only option will be for them to meet with them prior to their appearance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8426)|
| 2:20:33| but they can't talk to them during the arraignment. MR. GENERAL LUNDY Well, if the process that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8433)|
| 2:20:40| have been using now in the courts is what this would look like in the long term, and I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8440)|
| 2:20:44| that's probably a fair assumption, there is a phone line available where lawyers can speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8444)|
| 2:20:50| with their clients while they are in court if they have any questions and want to have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8450)|
| 2:20:55| conversation that is private and not open to others. I can't imagine that that would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8455)|
| 2:21:00| removed by any judge, and that's what's available right now, and that's how that has been handled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8460)|
| 2:21:06| by the judges for the last nine months. MS. TAYLOR Mr. Lutton, I would love to hear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8466)|
| 2:21:12| your thoughts. MR. LUTTON I do think that there are some issues there, and among my concerns is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8472)|
| 2:21:19| that practicing law has been incredibly challenging during the pandemic, and one of the ways that it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8479)|
| 2:21:27| is incredibly challenging is not having an ability to lean over and talk to your client, or the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8487)|
| 2:21:34| number of times that I will see things sort of go off the rails a little bit because a client is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8494)|
| 2:21:38| you know, you're not directly beside them. You know, during normal times, a client might start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8498)|
| 2:21:42| to speak up and either assert some fact or say something out loud where they really need to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8502)|
| 2:21:48| not asking, they need to be asking their lawyer questions and not speaking up and interacting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8508)|
| 2:21:51| directly with the court, and unfortunately, that does happen when you don't have the lawyer that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8511)|
| 2:21:55| can be there and, you know, put a hand on their shoulder or, you know, hey, ask me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8515)|
| 2:21:59| you know, ask me the question. There's also, you know, in terms of access to justice, there's also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8519)|
| 2:22:04| issues of, you know, we know from data that recidivism rates go up. The people are more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8524)|
| 2:22:11| likely to reoffend if you cut off their community ties when they're incarcerated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8531)|
| 2:22:16| Among the things that happened, even at arraignments, you know, this might not seem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8536)|
| 2:22:19| like a big deal, but even at arraignments, you know, where we're getting appointed to a case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8539)|
| 2:22:23| and, you know, the family is there, and you're able to sort of go talk to the family and talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8543)|
| 2:22:29| to your client, hey, your mom's here, your sister's here, you know, they want to be a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8549)|
| 2:22:32| pass along that they love you. They're going to try and do a video chat with you next Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8552)|
| 2:22:37| The communication that you can sort of have back and forth, you know, contemporaneously, I think is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8557)|
| 2:22:42| important during court proceedings. You know, candidly, it is, I do believe that it is critical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8562)|
| 2:22:49| during arraignments, but it is obviously more critical in other proceedings. And so, with talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8569)|
| 2:22:57| of, you know, possibly an attempt to amend Rule 43, which would allow potentially other types of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8577)|
| 2:23:02| proceedings to be heard remotely, you know, I worry what that means for justice going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8582)|
| 2:23:08| I think it's important to remember that we are supposed to be operating a criminal justice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8588)|
| 2:23:12| system and not a criminal processing system, although I do recognize the challenges of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8592)|
| 2:23:16| we are way behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8596)|
| 2:23:19| Thank you. Also, just some data that I just want to share since we are public. It said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8599)|
| 2:23:28| one study of criminal bail hearings found that defendants whose hearings are conducted over video| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8608)|
| 2:23:33| have a higher bond amount set than an in-person counterpart. Also, another study of immigration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8613)|
| 2:23:42| courts found that a detained individual will more likely be deported when their hearings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8622)|
| 2:23:47| occurred over video conference rather than person. And then the last one is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8627)|
| 2:23:54| a three out of six surveyed immigrants court judges identified instances where they had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8634)|
| 2:23:58| changed credibility assessments made during a video hearing after holding an in-person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8638)|
| 2:24:04| hearing. So, it seems like it's going to be a lot of confusion with communication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8644)|
| 2:24:12| I'm all for efficiency. I believe in efficiency, but I just don't think this is the right time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8652)|
| 2:24:19| for this right now. I think we still need to... People who are in jail or going on trial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8659)|
| 2:24:26| they're still humans, and I'm with you, Mr. Lutton, that we need to make sure we maintain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8666)|
| 2:24:31| that human contact because even though they've probably done some bad things or illegal things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8671)|
| 2:24:36| they're still humans and they need to see their family and all this, so we don't need to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8676)|
| 2:24:41| away that from them. Thank you. Thank you, Commissioner Lundy. By evidence of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8681)|

| 2:25:07| conversation, recess, and come back to it. I'm obviously open to either one of those. I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8707)|
| 2:25:12| want to keep everybody aware that in 14 minutes, we have zoning. So, I'll call on Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8712)|
| 2:25:19| Durrett, and we'll see how it goes. I'm willing to hold off if we need to, as long as Eric Lutton| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8719)|
| 2:25:29| and Richard Major can be here, as long as they can stay on past the zoning and come back so we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8729)|
| 2:25:37| can talk with them more. Gentlemen, do you have ability to stay with us? I'm seeing a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8737)|
| 2:25:42| nodded heads that maybe everybody's open for a quick break before we head to zonings, if you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8742)|
| 2:25:46| able to stay with us. That won't be a problem, Commissioner. I can certainly do that. Can I ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8746)|
| 2:25:52| how long you anticipate zoning to last? I'm trying to figure out if I have time to grab a quick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8752)|

| 2:26:31| back on there. Okay. If you could maybe just have one of your folks kind of put you on call there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8791)|
| 2:26:41| and if we have other questions, maybe we can track you down. Thank you. Okay. Everybody okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=8801)|
