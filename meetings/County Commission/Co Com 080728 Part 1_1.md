| 2:47:55| for the revenue shares is somewhere between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10075)|
| 2:47:59| $125,000 and, as Mr. Mays asserts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10079)|
| 2:48:03| $300,000. That's the analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10083)|
| 2:48:07| Now, in another issue, when I had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10087)|
| 2:48:11| questioned the authority of the mayor's office and the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10091)|
| 2:48:15| to dismiss Requeta Bone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10095)|
| 2:48:19| I read in the memorandum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10099)|
| 2:48:23| that they had that authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10103)|
| 2:48:27| Am I right to assume, then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10107)|
| 2:48:31| that the law department can settle this without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10111)|
| 2:48:35| county commission even though it's in excess of a million dollars? Is that true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10115)|
| 2:48:39| Because you said that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10119)|
| 2:48:43| I mean, I want to understand this. So we're right now getting ready to vote on whether we're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10123)|
| 2:48:47| accept this mediated settlement agreement. And if we do not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10127)|
| 2:48:51| is my understanding this right, that the law department is going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10131)|
| 2:48:55| request the court to dismiss it anyway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10135)|
| 2:48:59| The county's attorney in the false claims litigation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10139)|
| 2:49:03| has asked the court to dismiss the false claims lawsuit, yes. And that will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10143)|
| 2:49:07| continue regardless of what this commission does with respect to the mediated settlement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10147)|
| 2:49:11| agreement. Again, the mediated settlement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10151)|
| 2:49:15| agreement addresses separate claims, not the false claims| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10155)|
| 2:49:19| claims that are being litigated. It addresses the potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10159)|
| 2:49:23| breach of contract claims between the parties. The evaluation of our council, and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10163)|
| 2:49:27| happen to agree, is that there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10167)|
| 2:49:31| really is little value to the potential false claims action because the evidence just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10171)|
| 2:49:35| doesn't support it. So this call really is by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10175)|
| 2:49:39| outside counsel, someone that you all selected to get paid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10179)|
| 2:49:43| according to the paper almost $60,000. And that person is not an elected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10183)|
| 2:49:47| official. And that person has decided that it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10187)|
| 2:49:51| would be most advisable to do that. And now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10191)|
| 2:49:55| the law department has agreed. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10195)|
| 2:49:59| We have agreed based on their evaluation and based on our evaluation that they are correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10199)|
| 2:50:03| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10203)|
| 2:50:07| Commissioner Daniels. Let it be known that we own the mediation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10207)|
| 2:50:11| Thank you, Chairman. Commissioner Moore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10211)|
| 2:50:15| you obviously set in as a representative for the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10215)|
| 2:50:19| I'd be interested to hear what your opinion is of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10219)|
| 2:50:23| I signed the mediation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10223)|
| 2:50:27| agreement. Okay. And you're satisfied with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10227)|
| 2:50:31| mediation? I think you could say I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10231)|
| 2:50:35| satisfied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10235)|
| 2:50:39| with the mediation. I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10239)|
| 2:50:43| they were one thing that changed during the process, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10243)|
| 2:50:47| I think Rob could probably talk to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10247)|
| 2:50:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10251)|
| 2:50:59| Am I under the impression| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10259)|
| 2:51:03| I've seen a lot of documents like most of you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10263)|
| 2:51:07| stacks of them and talked to both parties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10267)|
| 2:51:11| that have been discussing this, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10271)|
| 2:51:15| is it my understanding that the EPA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10275)|
| 2:51:19| has written about violations, but has there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10279)|
| 2:51:23| actually been or they've written statements on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10283)|
| 2:51:27| their complaint forms, but are those considered complaints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10287)|
| 2:51:31| or are those considered EPA violations and has there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10291)|
| 2:51:35| been any fines on those, Bruce? I think you're probably referring to TDEC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10295)|
| 2:51:39| I'm sorry, TDEC. TDEC has been out to that facility over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10299)|
| 2:51:43| 60 times. They come out there on a monthly basis and then drop in unannounced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10303)|
| 2:51:47| They have noted deficiencies, but they have never cited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10307)|
| 2:51:51| us, they have never pulled the permit out from that facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10311)|
| 2:51:55| Okay. Let me ask you this, Bruce. Obviously we know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10315)|
| 2:51:59| a detention pond or two detention ponds have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10319)|
| 2:52:03| failed out there. Is that correct? One detention pond did fail, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10323)|
| 2:52:07| Okay. Who is actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10327)|
| 2:52:11| responsible for that site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10331)|
| 2:52:15| I know that's a multifaceted probably answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10335)|
| 2:52:19| but for those ponds, for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10339)|
| 2:52:23| the concrete pads, who is actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10343)|
| 2:52:27| responsible, not only for the upkeep, but for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10347)|
| 2:52:31| those performing properly? Knox County is, especially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10351)|
| 2:52:35| in reference to the ponds. Just as a point of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10355)|
| 2:52:39| clarification, I think at the last meeting it was, and I may be mistaken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10359)|
| 2:52:43| it was alleged that Knox County was involved in some kind of cover-up in regards to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10363)|
| 2:52:47| pond failure. I was involved with the pond failure to the extent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10367)|
| 2:52:51| that I addressed the issue of how to repair the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10371)|
| 2:52:55| pond. The day we were notified we had a problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10375)|
| 2:52:59| with the pond, that very day we contacted TDEC. We let them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10379)|
| 2:53:03| know there was a problem. The very next day we met| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10383)|
| 2:53:07| with TDEC and had a plan of action on how to correct the problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10387)|
| 2:53:11| with the pond. The pond that actually failed was an overflow pond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10391)|
| 2:53:15| Essentially what was in that pond amounted to rainwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10395)|
| 2:53:19| We had previously tested that pond and it was safe to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10399)|
| 2:53:23| swimming in. The levels in the pond was safe for human contact. Clearly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10403)|
| 2:53:27| you don't want to drink the water, but you could have gone swimming in it or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10407)|
| 2:53:31| So I just want to make sure that was clear. So there was never an attempt by Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10411)|
| 2:53:35| to be involved in any kind of cover-up. Now, in regards to Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10415)|
| 2:53:39| Popswell, John Evans put in a letter that there was no active| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10419)|
| 2:53:43| well within a mile of that site. He was wrong. Mr. Popswell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10423)|
| 2:53:47| is within a mile of the site. He was wrong. Pure and simple, that's all I can say about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10427)|
| 2:53:51| But there was never an attempt to do a cover-up. We have correspondence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10431)|
| 2:53:55| that we had sent to TDEC notifying them of the failure of the pond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10435)|
| 2:53:59| Follow-up meeting the very next day with TDEC and representatives of my staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10439)|
| 2:54:03| outlining a plan of action to correct that deficiency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10443)|
| 2:54:07| Bruce, one last question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10447)|
| 2:54:11| When we purchased that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10451)|
| 2:54:15| based on what we were going to place there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10455)|
| 2:54:19| should that property have had some core sampling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10459)|
| 2:54:23| some wells drilled to see exactly what we were getting before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10463)|
| 2:54:27| we tried to put ponds on a site where there's caverns?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10467)|
| 2:54:31| Let me give you my experience that I've had with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10471)|
| 2:54:35| geotechnical type things, especially as it relates to sinkholes. It's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10475)|
| 2:54:39| hit-or-miss situation. Commissioner Leuthold might even remember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10479)|
| 2:54:43| this. It was a few months ago we brought a change order in for a bridge project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10483)|
| 2:54:47| that we were doing that we had core drilling out on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10487)|
| 2:54:51| And they missed it. They missed the actual throat of the sinkhole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10491)|
| 2:54:55| So, in effect, at the end of the day, we ended up having to go in and repair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10495)|
| 2:54:59| the sinkhole. So sometimes you can go out there and do the core drillings and come up with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10499)|
| 2:55:03| nothing. However, in Knox County, and anyone in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10503)|
| 2:55:07| geology field will tell you, that Knox County is laced with sinkholes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10507)|
| 2:55:11| I think the proper course of action on this would have been to anticipate the sinkhole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10511)|
| 2:55:15| and line the ponds ahead of time. That's probably what should have been done and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10515)|
| 2:55:19| didn't happen. The ponds, I don't know that I would have spent the money on the geotech. I would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10519)|
| 2:55:23| gone ahead and just lined the ponds. And I want to make sure I understand this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10523)|
| 2:55:27| Going back to TDEC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10527)|
| 2:55:31| are you stating that Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10531)|
| 2:55:35| is responsible for lack of compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10535)|
| 2:55:39| to TDEC or EPA regulations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10539)|
| 2:55:43| No, I'm not saying that. The responsibility Knox County has is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10543)|
| 2:55:47| the ponds are Knox County's to maintain. There's no question about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10547)|
| 2:55:51| Knox County does have the permit. Knox County is not actually the one out there doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10551)|
| 2:55:55| the composting and we're not the ones physically doing the testing. But at the end of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10555)|
| 2:55:59| day, it is Knox County's permit, if that answers your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10559)|
| 2:56:03| Thank you. Thank you, Chairman. Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10563)|
| 2:56:07| Commissioner Daniel, that's exactly what I was going to ask. That's a good question. I'm thinking along the same lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10567)|
| 2:56:11| Mr. Greaves, you've been patient. Let me hear from you real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10571)|
| 2:56:15| I have more than this, but in response to the questions that you just asked, Mr. Daniels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10575)|
| 2:56:19| you asked if there are violations that are written up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10579)|
| 2:56:23| Mr. Weitrich characterized them as deficiencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10583)|
| 2:56:27| This is a form of violation. V1 or V2. Violation 1 or Violation 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10587)|
| 2:56:31| There are 30 of them in an 18-month period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10591)|
| 2:56:35| Sir, I need your name and address. I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10595)|
| 2:56:39| Jack Randall Greaves, 3901 Topside Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10599)|
| 2:56:43| Please get closer to the microphone or speak up. Thank you. In addition, Mr. Weitrich just gave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10603)|
| 2:56:47| testimony that only one of the two ponds failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10607)|
| 2:56:51| I'm reading the narrative comments to you from the July 23, 2004| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10611)|
| 2:56:55| TDEC violation report. The narrative comment reads as follows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10615)|
| 2:56:59| verbatim. Knox County Solid Waste notified Solid Waste Management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10619)|
| 2:57:03| about a collapse in the berm on pond number 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10623)|
| 2:57:07| This occurred while they were stabilizing a berm collapse on pond number 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10627)|
| 2:57:11| Both ponds were down simultaneously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10631)|
| 2:57:15| On July 23, 2004, not according to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10635)|
| 2:57:19| but according to TDEC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10639)|
| 2:57:23| Commissioner Smith. Yes, sir. Would you mind if I ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10643)|
| 2:57:27| Bruce, what does that mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10647)|
| 2:57:31| The pond number 1 actually breached. Pond number 2 had a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10651)|
| 2:57:35| berm failure. It was not a breach. Ultimately, Knox County went in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10655)|
| 2:57:39| and corrected both ponds by putting a liner in them. When you went out there and looked at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10659)|
| 2:57:43| pond number 1, there was a sinkhole about as big as this stage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10663)|
| 2:57:47| formed over the weekend is about how big it was. So we went in, we took| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10667)|
| 2:57:51| corrective action, lined, ultimately lined both ponds, and in fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10671)|
| 2:57:55| the contract to approve the lining of both ponds actually went before commission in June| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10675)|
| 2:57:59| of, I forget, I think it was 2006, 2004. I have to look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10679)|
| 2:58:03| at the year. Thank you, Commissioner Smith. Do you have any other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10683)|
| 2:58:07| questions? Yeah. We've heard from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10687)|
| 2:58:11| one side. I just want to hear any rebuttal that you have. Thank you, Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10691)|
| 2:58:15| The question that's immediately before council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10695)|
| 2:58:19| right now, or commission right now, is whether or not to defer for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10699)|
| 2:58:23| I'm going to ask that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10703)|
| 2:58:27| you not do that. And I'm going to ask you because there is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10707)|
| 2:58:31| a total dismissal of common sense and logic that permeates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10711)|
| 2:58:35| this entire process. You just heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10715)|
| 2:58:39| Mr. Farmer stand in front of you and recite a lot of statistics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10719)|
| 2:58:43| that were very impressive, about eight days of depositions and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10723)|
| 2:58:47| lots of pages of this and that, and they were quite impressive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10727)|
| 2:58:51| But at the same time, you heard Mr. McConkie say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10731)|
| 2:58:55| gee, there's two sets of numbers here, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10735)|
| 2:58:59| they don't know which one's right, and they don't want to know which one's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10739)|
| 2:59:03| When Mr. Weitrick gave a sworn deposition in May| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10743)|
| 2:59:07| of this year, he gave a deposition and said, I think the number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10747)|
| 2:59:11| that's owed is about $140,000. And at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10751)|
| 2:59:15| the same time, they did not do a cost analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10755)|
| 2:59:19| When you don't do a cost analysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10759)|
| 2:59:23| doesn't common sense mandate, dictate that you do an audit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10763)|
| 2:59:27| But there is no audit. When you look through the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10767)|
| 2:59:31| mediated settlement agreement that is before you, you're not going to find any of these numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10771)|
| 2:59:35| And I think the taxpayer deserves numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10775)|
| 2:59:39| Mr. McConkie said that, gee, the difference between the two may be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10779)|
| 2:59:43| an interpretation of the language. If you actually read the revenue sharing language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10783)|
| 2:59:47| in the contract, there's no room for interpretation there. It's simple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10787)|
| 2:59:51| and it's very clear. The language says all products sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10791)|
| 2:59:55| All landscaping products. And the difference between those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10795)|
| 2:59:59| two schedules that are being referred to, and there's a copy of them in front of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10799)|
| 3:00:03| there's a big paper clip on it that was put there at the request of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10803)|
| 3:00:07| a commissioner earlier today. The difference is that one schedule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10807)|
| 3:00:11| that shows that they owe over $300,000 reflects all products| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10811)|
| 3:00:15| sold, which includes their biggest product, which is colored mulch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10815)|
| 3:00:19| The one that reflects that they owe $140,000 leaves it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10819)|
| 3:00:23| Common sense tells you, and an easy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10823)|
| 3:00:27| reading of the language tells you that it's all products. It's real simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10827)|
| 3:00:31| But a lot of men got into a room and worked very hard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10831)|
| 3:00:35| but they left common sense at the door. Because you cannot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10835)|
| 3:00:39| settle a money issue without knowing how much one party owes the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10839)|
| 3:00:43| and vice versa. But no one ever did that. And they don't show you that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10843)|
| 3:00:47| And I suggest to you that you should throw this contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10847)|
| 3:00:51| away and not even consider it until there's an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10851)|
| 3:00:55| audit or until somebody takes a stand and says whether $300,000 is owed to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10855)|
| 3:00:59| taxpayer or whether $140,000 is owed to the taxpayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10859)|
| 3:01:03| I hope you were shaking your head as I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10863)|
| 3:01:07| when Mr. McConkie said, gee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10867)|
| 3:01:11| natural resources contends that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10871)|
| 3:01:15| Knox County owes them $1.6 million. Did you catch that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10875)|
| 3:01:19| I caught it. It was incredulous to me because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10879)|
| 3:01:23| what did Knox County really do to these people? You gave them a multi-million dollar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10883)|
| 3:01:27| facility and you didn't get paid. That's what you did to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10887)|
| 3:01:31| Now, how in the world could you owe them $1.6 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10891)|
| 3:01:35| You also heard Mr. Farmer tell you that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10895)|
| 3:01:39| gee, I guess we're supposed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10899)|
| 3:01:43| have improved the Forks of the River| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10903)|
| 3:01:47| site, went out there and spent a bunch of money. Well, clearly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10907)|
| 3:01:51| common sense tells you that any expansion out there would have been in contemplation of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10911)|
| 3:01:55| a composting permit, and that's what they've been complaining about. And there is no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10915)|
| 3:01:59| more composting permit. Why in the world would anyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10919)|
| 3:02:03| with a lick of common sense even be talking about going out there and expanding Forks of the River| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10923)|
| 3:02:07| to handle green waste? Heck, you can handle green waste on the dirt. You don't need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10927)|
| 3:02:11| But they're using that as a tactic to try to convince you that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10931)|
| 3:02:15| oh my gosh, if we don't sign this mediated contract agreement, we're going to have to go out there and spend half a million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10935)|
| 3:02:19| dollars putting down concrete. Well, to do what? It makes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10939)|
| 3:02:23| no sense. But it's an effort to try to stampede you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10943)|
| 3:02:27| into signing a document that, again, makes no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10947)|
| 3:02:31| common sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10951)|
| 3:02:35| One of the things Mr. McConkie said that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10955)|
| 3:02:39| if natural resources maintains that you own 1.6 million dollars, the word| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10959)|
| 3:02:43| he used was you might quibble with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10963)|
| 3:02:47| I would hope you would do more than quibble with it. I would ask how in the world| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10967)|
| 3:02:51| you could owe them 1.6 million dollars. If you look at the proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10971)|
| 3:02:55| that they gave Knox County, in 2007 they show that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10975)|
| 3:02:59| lost $238,000 and the year before that they lost over $100,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10979)|
| 3:03:03| In fact, supposedly they've been shafted out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10983)|
| 3:03:07| of receiving a bunch of green waste and gee, they're losing money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10987)|
| 3:03:11| and they can't afford to pay you. So why all of a sudden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10991)|
| 3:03:15| are they standing up and saying you owe me 1.6 million dollars because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10995)|
| 3:03:19| you didn't put some concrete down on a tiny site out at Forks of the River| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10999)|
| 3:03:23| that's only a few acres big and most of it's dedicated to receiving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11003)|
| 3:03:27| recycling efforts and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11007)|
| 3:03:31| trash from the citizens of Knox County anyway, just like all the other ones around town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11011)|
| 3:03:35| I'll hurry, but please listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11015)|
| 3:03:39| Well, Mr. Greaves, you need to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11019)|
| 3:03:43| Mr. Greaves, do you know, have they charged up anything from Louisiana up to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11023)|
| 3:03:47| Actually they have. Their financial statements for 2007 that they put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11027)|
| 3:03:51| in their proposal is in that little package in front of you and it's an amazing document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11031)|
| 3:03:55| It shows that they took in $2.1 million dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11035)|
| 3:03:59| of income. Now this is the company that's been standing in front of you in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11039)|
| 3:04:03| Solid Waste has been standing in front of you saying, gee, we didn't get enough tipping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11043)|
| 3:04:07| We were shortchanged on that. Well, if they were shortchanged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11047)|
| 3:04:11| on 15,000 tons of green waste, which should have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11051)|
| 3:04:15| 30, that's not $2.1 million dollars. If they were shorted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11055)|
| 3:04:19| on the tipping, they also didn't have the product to sell because it didn't show up either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11059)|
| 3:04:23| So how did they get $2.1 million dollars in revenue? Because they took in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11063)|
| 3:04:27| tons and tons of biosolids and got paid $50| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11067)|
| 3:04:31| a ton to take it in. $2.1 million dollars and they can't pay the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11071)|
| 3:04:35| taxpayer? But let's look at what they did spend their money on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11075)|
| 3:04:39| What they did spend their money on is rather amazing. Below the gross profit line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11079)|
| 3:04:43| below the operating costs, down in SG&A, they spent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11083)|
| 3:04:47| $167,000 on SG&A, whatever that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11087)|
| 3:04:51| It could be a lot of things. But they spent $48,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11091)|
| 3:04:55| traveling back and forth to Louisiana. Hotels and airplanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11095)|
| 3:04:59| Now they can pay for that, but they can't pay the taxpayer. They can't pay us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11099)|
| 3:05:03| They also spent $170,000 on legal and professional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11103)|
| 3:05:07| fees. They can pay all that, but they can't pay the taxpayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11107)|
| 3:05:11| They can't pay us. And lastly, in response to your question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11111)|
| 3:05:15| in 2007 they reflect that they have an overhead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11115)|
| 3:05:19| allocation of $185,000. Presumably that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11119)|
| 3:05:23| sent back to their home office in Louisiana to cover the overhead there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11123)|
| 3:05:27| I don't know. But if you add all that up, it's $570,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11127)|
| 3:05:31| worth of overhead that they paid to lawyers, Louisiana, airplanes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11131)|
| 3:05:35| hotels, but they can't pay the taxpayer. And they had $2.1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11135)|
| 3:05:39| million dollars to do it with. Where is the common sense? Doesn't it tell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11139)|
| 3:05:43| you right there that something's wrong? I'll conclude| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11143)|
| 3:05:47| by saying that if they lost all this money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11147)|
| 3:05:51| why do they want three more years of it or ten more years of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11151)|
| 3:05:55| They lost all this money. How in the world| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11155)|
| 3:05:59| can they start paying you now that biosolids are gone and the revenues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11159)|
| 3:06:03| are going to be cut? Now that the thing's shrinking, we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11163)|
| 3:06:07| now start paying you where we couldn't before when we had $2.1 million dollars we couldn't pay you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11167)|
| 3:06:11| But now we can. It makes no common sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11171)|
| 3:06:15| It makes no common sense whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11175)|
| 3:06:23| I'll close with that because I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11183)|
| 3:06:27| I have very little time left. I could go on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11187)|
| 3:06:31| in a lot of points. It's a lot of money. Knox County gave away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11191)|
| 3:06:35| three things in this mediated settlement agreement that they want you to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11195)|
| 3:06:39| They gave away all past due amounts. It's $300,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11199)|
| 3:06:43| plus. We can all read that contract. You don't have to be a lawyer to read| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11203)|
| 3:06:47| and understand what the word all products means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11207)|
| 3:06:51| The next thing it does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11211)|
| 3:06:55| it gets rid of all your claims. This fraud claim doesn't just go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11215)|
| 3:06:59| away. It gets rid of breach of contract claims. The lawyers for Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11219)|
| 3:07:03| say breach of contract, breach of contract. Well, it makes those go away too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11223)|
| 3:07:07| You are forgiving them of any claims that may have come up from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11227)|
| 3:07:11| the past. You're giving them a release. And that includes environmental issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11231)|
| 3:07:15| If somebody's gotten sick out there, you've given them a release.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11235)|
| 3:07:19| It's very serious what you're giving away. That's why this environmental stuff, you can say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11239)|
| 3:07:23| we're not doing biosolids anymore. But when you're giving somebody a release for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11243)|
| 3:07:27| past behavior concerning these issues, it's very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11247)|
| 3:07:31| And the last thing you're doing is you're extending their contracts for three more years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11251)|
| 3:07:35| Now, using a little bit of common sense that your constituents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11255)|
| 3:07:39| expect you to do, why in the world would you want to do business for three more years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11259)|
| 3:07:43| with somebody that says you owe me $1.6 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11263)|
| 3:07:47| and all you did was give them a multi-million dollar facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11267)|
| 3:07:51| to operate and not get paid?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11271)|
| 3:07:55| I can't imagine why you would. And I ask that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11275)|
| 3:07:59| not only not put this off for 30 days, there's ample reason to vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11279)|
| 3:08:03| no on this and dispose of it and send these people back to do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11283)|
| 3:08:07| The last thing, in the devotional today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11287)|
| 3:08:11| the good minister encouraged each one of you to act justly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11291)|
| 3:08:15| today. Not tomorrow, not next month, not next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11295)|
| 3:08:19| The good minister exhorted you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11299)|
| 3:08:23| to act justly today. And it's time to act justly on behalf of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11303)|
| 3:08:27| taxpayer and not worry about lawsuits and threatened lawsuits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11307)|
| 3:08:31| He hasn't done anything wrong. What have you done wrong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11311)|
| 3:08:35| Good question. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11315)|
| 3:08:39| Just mention, Mr. Graves, while you're there, I really appreciate your comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11319)|
| 3:08:43| and this is what really strikes home for me is the fact that I do not want to release| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11323)|
| 3:08:47| them of anything that's going to come up. Commissioners, I am a former| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11327)|
| 3:08:51| TDEC commissioner appointed by the governor back in 2000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11331)|
| 3:08:55| I've quit being on that. That was about a three or four year term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11335)|
| 3:08:59| What concerns me is we talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11339)|
| 3:09:03| all these accusations and TDEC this and TDEC that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11343)|
| 3:09:07| but commissioners, I've yet to see TDEC here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11347)|
| 3:09:11| And that concerns me that they're not here. It's sort of like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11351)|
| 3:09:15| John Evans isn't here and TDEC isn't here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11355)|
| 3:09:19| I'm not comfortable with this at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11359)|
| 3:09:23| But I appreciate hearing from both sides from it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11363)|
| 3:09:27| and I certainly don't want to give any more money to somebody that says it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11367)|
| 3:09:31| can't go in the future with it. I'm going to be voting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11371)|
| 3:09:35| against this. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11375)|
| 3:09:39| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11379)|
| 3:09:43| Bruce, this is for you since we're talking about these ponds. You said one of those ponds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11383)|
| 3:09:47| just was supposed to hold rainwater. That's correct. It was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11387)|
| 3:09:51| an overflow pond to the primary pond. So if the volume in the primary pond was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11391)|
| 3:09:55| exceeded, it would overflow. And we had tested that pond prior,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11395)|
| 3:09:59| just coincidentally had tested prior to the sinkhole forming, and those tests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11399)|
| 3:10:03| came out basically saying that it was safe for human contact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11403)|
| 3:10:07| What about the other pond? The other pond is the primary runoff pond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11407)|
| 3:10:11| Now it did not breach. It had a berm failure, but it did not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11411)|
| 3:10:15| breach. It's a bit of a difference. At the end of the day, though, we lined both of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11415)|
| 3:10:19| ponds so that the water cannot seep into the ground and do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11419)|
| 3:10:23| water contamination. This is for Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11423)|
| 3:10:27| McConkie there. Sir,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11427)|
| 3:10:31| if someone broke the contract first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11431)|
| 3:10:35| would that not hold the other side harmless?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11435)|
| 3:10:39| Not necessarily, sir. You wouldn't have a null and void contract if someone broke it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11439)|
| 3:10:43| Not necessarily, sir, no. Okay. Well, I just wonder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11443)|
| 3:10:47| the reason why I'm asking you this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11447)|
| 3:10:51| I would think that National Resources broke this contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11451)|
| 3:10:55| first because we paid them the first month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11455)|
| 3:10:59| a tipping fee, and as they sold this mulch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11459)|
| 3:11:03| we have never received the first penny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11463)|
| 3:11:07| And I would say that would be the first operating procedures that they were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11467)|
| 3:11:11| The contract has multiple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11471)|
| 3:11:15| and independent obligations, and we've done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11475)|
| 3:11:19| These other obligations, like extending the concrete pad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11479)|
| 3:11:23| they weren't to be done immediately, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11483)|
| 3:11:27| Extending the concrete pad, no, that was done in, or the process was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11487)|
| 3:11:31| started in 2004, about when the sinkhole opened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11491)|
| 3:11:35| What was an immediate obligation was within the first year of Forks of the River was to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11495)|
| 3:11:39| upgraded and permitted within one year of the contract date. That was in one year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11499)|
| 3:11:43| of the contract. Yes, sir. But the day that they went in business out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11503)|
| 3:11:47| we started paying them for taking our mulch, did we not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11507)|
| 3:11:51| For taking green waste, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11511)|
| 3:11:55| They have never paid us a fee back, so they broke the contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11515)|
| 3:11:59| the first month out there. That would be my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11519)|
| 3:12:03| And I believe that would be what it would be in a court of law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11523)|
| 3:12:07| They didn't pay us. We haven't been paid yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11527)|
| 3:12:11| Another thing is, I'm concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11531)|
| 3:12:15| Mr. Evans has caught a lot of flack| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11535)|
| 3:12:19| over not collecting this money. Now, he's dead and gone. He's not here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11539)|
| 3:12:23| to explain himself, to explain whether he was told to do that or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11543)|
| 3:12:27| do that. But no department head has the authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11547)|
| 3:12:31| to do that. In December,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11551)|
| 3:12:35| when Mr. Salter came on, I asked him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11555)|
| 3:12:39| if he had collected any money since he'd been here, and I believe he said he'd been here three or four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11559)|
| 3:12:43| weeks. I told him to start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11563)|
| 3:12:47| collecting the money. The money is what I'm really interested in this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11567)|
| 3:12:51| Here the other day at the finance meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11571)|
| 3:12:55| and you correct me, Mr. Salter, if I'm wrong on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11575)|
| 3:12:59| I believe you said they hadn't collected a penny yet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11579)|
| 3:13:03| and you took it up on yourself to waive the fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11583)|
| 3:13:07| Is that correct, Mr. Salter? Do you want to step up to the podium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11587)|
| 3:13:11| Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11591)|
| 3:13:15| if I can, for the record, the contract states that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11595)|
| 3:13:19| the revenue sharing payments are due quarterly, and in March| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11599)|
| 3:13:23| of this year is when the commission directed that the parties go to mediation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11603)|
| 3:13:27| Mr. Salter, did you take it up on yourself to waive the fees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11607)|
| 3:13:31| No. I believe you said that at the finance meeting, though, didn't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11611)|
| 3:13:35| I said that I hadn't collected any, but I didn't characterize it as having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11615)|
| 3:13:39| taken it up myself. I believe you said because we were in a lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11619)|
| 3:13:43| That's right. That's the reason why you took it on yourself not to collect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11623)|
| 3:13:47| That's right. Is that correct? Yes. All right. Where does the department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11627)|
| 3:13:51| head have to decide on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11631)|
| 3:13:55| not to collect fees in Knox County, the money that's due us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11635)|
| 3:13:59| Is that in your job description anywhere, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11639)|
| 3:14:03| I'm not sure. I mean, I'm sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11643)|
| 3:14:07| Well, if it wasn't in John Evans' job description,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11647)|
| 3:14:11| I don't think it would have been in yours either. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11651)|
| 3:14:15| The situation was, quite frankly, that when John Evans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11655)|
| 3:14:19| waived the fee, and he had a number of reasons why he waived the fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11659)|
| 3:14:23| It wasn't one reason, and it didn't happen, and it was a progressive number of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11663)|
| 3:14:27| It was clear that Knox County was not in compliance with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11667)|
| 3:14:31| contract. It was also clear that Natural Resources was not in compliance with the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11671)|
| 3:14:35| That's why we've gone to mediated settlement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11675)|
| 3:14:39| For Mr. Salter to then, in December, say we want our money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11679)|
| 3:14:43| I mean, that's what all this discussion is about. Clearly, Natural Resources could have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11683)|
| 3:14:47| turned to me and said, well, we want our center out at Forks of the River.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11687)|
| 3:14:51| So that's what the mediated settlement was all about. Mr. Salter didn't waive anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11691)|
| 3:14:55| He didn't waive anything. It's just part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11695)|
| 3:14:59| of what we're trying to settle now. We're trying to settle these contractual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11699)|
| 3:15:03| disputes, and it's all wrapped up into one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11703)|
| 3:15:07| It's not one item. I don't think we can request this one item from Natural Resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11707)|
| 3:15:11| and in turn not give them something back. Clearly, yes, you're absolutely right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11711)|
| 3:15:15| We have been paying a tipping fee to Natural Resources to take green waste out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11715)|
| 3:15:19| My alternative to that is to take it to a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11719)|
| 3:15:23| sanitary landfill and they bury it. Instead, we pay a lower rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11723)|
| 3:15:27| They take it and grind it, and it's essentially recycled. So clearly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11727)|
| 3:15:31| I'm going to continue taking the green waste to the place that's most environmentally sensitive as opposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11731)|
| 3:15:35| to a landfill. So it's not Mr. Salter for him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11735)|
| 3:15:39| to jump up and say, hey, you need to start paying us. It's all tied together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11739)|
| 3:15:43| So all these issues have got to be resolved at one time, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11743)|
| 3:15:47| therefore, we can go forward. I understand that, but the only thing I can take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11747)|
| 3:15:51| Mr. Salter at is his word, and he stood up here and said that he took it on himself to waive that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11751)|
| 3:15:55| because of the lawsuit. I don't mean to interrupt you. I think Mr. Salter has been on the job a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11755)|
| 3:15:59| He was up here at the podium, and yes, he did say, yes, I'll start doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11759)|
| 3:16:03| Clearly, after he and I sat down and talked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11763)|
| 3:16:07| it was going to be a futile effort because we knew all of this was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11767)|
| 3:16:11| interlaced. It was not an attempt for us to mislead you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11771)|
| 3:16:15| in any way. Never done that. Don't intend to. It just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11775)|
| 3:16:19| wasn't possible for us to all of a sudden start demanding they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11779)|
| 3:16:23| start paying this. It's all tied together. It's a very complicated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11783)|
| 3:16:27| process, and it's all tied together. Mr. McConkie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11787)|
| 3:16:31| in this mediation settlement, are we to go ahead and build this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11791)|
| 3:16:35| concrete pad? We are not obligated to do so. We would have the election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11795)|
| 3:16:39| to do so. But it's not in there that we have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11799)|
| 3:16:43| do it? We are relieved of any obligation. I'm sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11803)|
| 3:16:47| I may have misunderstood your question. You're talking about the mediated settlement agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11807)|
| 3:16:51| Is it in there that we're still going to have to go ahead and build the concrete pad and everything? No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11811)|
| 3:16:55| They release us of any obligation to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11815)|
| 3:16:59| And we're going to be released of that in the future, is that correct? Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11819)|
| 3:17:03| But a concrete pad is only needed if you do biosolids?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11823)|
| 3:17:07| Are you finished, Commissioner Pinkston? Commissioner Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11827)|
| 3:17:11| Yes, he's finished. I had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11831)|
| 3:17:15| several questions that I would like the legal people. I've looked at both the RFP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11835)|
| 3:17:19| and the contract very carefully. And one of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11839)|
| 3:17:23| the issues here is that we need to settle on this through the mediated agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11843)|
| 3:17:27| because there were breaches of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11847)|
| 3:17:31| contract on the part of the county. And I'm still trying to clarify in my mind what those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11851)|
| 3:17:35| breaches actually were. And from what I gather, one of them was that we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11855)|
| 3:17:39| promised 15,000 tons or greater of the green waste| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11859)|
| 3:17:43| and that wasn't provided. Is that one of the issues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11863)|
| 3:17:47| That is an issue that has been raised, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11867)|
| 3:17:51| And it's never comfortable for a lawyer to sit up here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11871)|
| 3:17:55| and give away his views and strategies of a case. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11875)|
| 3:17:59| it would be my opinion that that would be a very weak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11879)|
| 3:18:03| claim. I would agree because if you look under Section 3.1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11883)|
| 3:18:07| on the RFP, it just states that Knox County, I mean it says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11887)|
| 3:18:11| last year we had approximately 15,000 tons of green waste were processed. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11891)|
| 3:18:15| then about a sentence later it says Knox County believes the potential exists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11895)|
| 3:18:19| and it goes on to say to double or triple it. But I don't see any obligation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11899)|
| 3:18:23| that we say to do that. So to me that appears to be a weak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11903)|
| 3:18:27| claim of a breach on our part. And we're on the same page on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11907)|
| 3:18:31| There are two alleged potential breaches that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11911)|
| 3:18:35| trouble me. The first is the failure to upgrade and permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11915)|
| 3:18:39| forks to the river because that is a clear obligation of the contract. And it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11919)|
| 3:18:43| our Solid Waste Department has readily admitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11923)|
| 3:18:47| and it should be obvious to the world that we haven't done that yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11927)|
| 3:18:51| I'd like to see where that is because actually on Section 3.1 it says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11931)|
| 3:18:55| that at Knox County, there's two parts that I would question that on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11935)|
| 3:18:59| One, it says in addition that Knox County, they talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11939)|
| 3:19:03| about the facility out at the forks of the river. And it says that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11943)|
| 3:19:07| they do intend to increase it to at least seven acres with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11947)|
| 3:19:11| intensive stockpiling green waste. And then the very last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11951)|
| 3:19:15| sentence, this is next to the last on page five of the RFP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11955)|
| 3:19:19| it says if the demand warrants. And even according| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11959)|
| 3:19:23| to natural resources, the demand never seemed to warrant that. That's one issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11963)|
| 3:19:27| And then if you go to Section 5.5 on Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11967)|
| 3:19:31| responsibilities, it says that future site expansion as mutually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11971)|
| 3:19:35| agreed upon. And it would seem to me that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11975)|
| 3:19:39| one, that would relieve us of that part of the contract because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11979)|
| 3:19:43| it says if the, I'm trying to read the exact word, if demand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11983)|
| 3:19:47| warrants. And I think everyone agrees that demand didn't warrant. And then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11987)|
| 3:19:51| on Section 5.1, it says future site expansion as mutually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11991)|
| 3:19:55| agreed upon. Yes, sir. And first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11995)|
| 3:19:59| I don't know that everyone would agree that demand didn't warrant. But secondly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=11999)|
| 3:20:03| you're reading from the request for proposals and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12003)|
| 3:20:07| the request for proposals was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12007)|
| 3:20:11| succeeded by the actual contract document itself, which was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12011)|
| 3:20:15| dated December| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12015)|
| 3:20:19| 4, 2002. And that's included in part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12019)|
| 3:20:23| of the materials that I sent you. In paragraph 2B of the contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12023)|
| 3:20:27| do you have that with you? Yes, I do. Okay. Paragraph 2B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12027)|
| 3:20:31| which is on page two of the contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12031)|
| 3:20:35| down towards the bottom, in fact, I believe it's the last sentence, Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12035)|
| 3:20:39| shall upgrade, expand, and stabilize the site at the Forks of the River Convenience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12039)|
| 3:20:43| Center within six months of the date of this agreement and shall obtain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12043)|
| 3:20:47| all necessary permits and licenses for the upgrading and operating of the operations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12047)|
| 3:20:51| as contemplated under the request for proposal and this agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12051)|
| 3:20:55| at Forks of the River Convenience Center honored before the first anniversary of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12055)|
| 3:20:59| this agreement. So in the contract itself, we made the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12059)|
| 3:21:03| commitment to go ahead with that project. With| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12063)|
| 3:21:07| regard to expansion of the concrete pad at Solway, it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12067)|
| 3:21:11| you're correct, contemplated in the RFP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12071)|
| 3:21:15| that that would be something that was done in the future. That's a process that was actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12075)|
| 3:21:19| set in motion in 2004 when the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12079)|
| 3:21:23| obtained a grant from the state of Tennessee for the purposes of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12083)|
| 3:21:27| expanding the concrete pad. Not long after that grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12087)|
| 3:21:31| agreement, or right about the time that grant agreement was signed, is when the sink| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12091)|
| 3:21:35| hole opened up and caused one of our detention ponds to drain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12095)|
| 3:21:39| and Solid Waste was forced to divert some of its funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12099)|
| 3:21:43| or, well, all of the grant funds to the repair of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12103)|
| 3:21:47| and lining of those detention ponds. The reason that is significant is because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12107)|
| 3:21:51| it left no money to go forward with the concrete pad expansion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12111)|
| 3:21:55| and TDEC began making that a very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12115)|
| 3:21:59| strong point of contention with the county and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12119)|
| 3:22:03| began threatening to take enforcement action against our permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12123)|
| 3:22:07| and in fact change their position with regard to storing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12127)|
| 3:22:11| materials off the pad. They began requiring the county to store materials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12131)|
| 3:22:15| on the pad to force the issue of expanding that pad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12135)|
| 3:22:19| If it was not done, or if the county didn't find a way to get those materials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12139)|
| 3:22:23| onto the pad, the county's permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12143)|
| 3:22:27| was in jeopardy. Under the contract, the county definitely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12147)|
| 3:22:31| had the obligation to keep its permit in good standing. And I guess the final| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12151)|
| 3:22:35| legal question that I would raise is that when you have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12155)|
| 3:22:39| and I don't want to in any way denigrate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12159)|
| 3:22:43| Mr. Evans on this, but item 25| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12163)|
| 3:22:47| of the contract says that it is agreed that this contract represents the entire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12167)|
| 3:22:51| contract between the parties and no prior representations, promises and agreements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12171)|
| 3:22:55| oral or otherwise shall have any effect or force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12175)|
| 3:22:59| And I just wondered if it seems like a lot of what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12179)|
| 3:23:03| this whole mediation was based upon was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12183)|
| 3:23:07| the oral agreement between a mid-level person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12187)|
| 3:23:11| and the contractor. And it seems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12191)|
| 3:23:15| to me the contract states fairly clearly that any other agreements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12195)|
| 3:23:19| do not have any validity, or to use the words of the contract, have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12199)|
| 3:23:23| any force or effect. Well, and that would certainly be a point of dispute if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12203)|
| 3:23:27| have to litigate this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12207)|
| 3:23:31| And that is the position that we have taken. They of course take the position that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12211)|
| 3:23:35| well, he was a director of the Department of Solid Waste. He was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12215)|
| 3:23:39| directly responsible for administering the contract and that they relied on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12219)|
| 3:23:43| his actions in administering the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12223)|
| 3:23:47| Part of the problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12227)|
| 3:23:51| and why we're spending so long on this is we're being invited by certain people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12231)|
| 3:23:55| to try the lawsuit right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12235)|
| 3:23:59| And we can do that. We'll be here forever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12239)|
| 3:24:03| because there's not a judge here to decide the case. But the purpose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12243)|
| 3:24:07| of the settlement agreement, of course, is to try to avoid the costs and risks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12247)|
| 3:24:11| of litigating. And we've evaluated this case. We believe that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12251)|
| 3:24:15| there are, well, there's always costs involved with litigating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12255)|
| 3:24:19| We believe that there are definite risks in litigating this case and that under the circumstances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12259)|
| 3:24:23| this settlement agreement serves the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12263)|
| 3:24:27| county's best interest for minimizing its risks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12267)|
| 3:24:31| And I'm not trying to put all the culpability on the county because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12271)|
| 3:24:35| Mr. Evans did not come back or did not go through Mr. Wheatry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12275)|
| 3:24:39| can come back to the commission with an amendment to the contract when there were problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12279)|
| 3:24:43| which may or may not have been looked upon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12283)|
| 3:24:47| favorably. But I would have even thought that the contractor would have wanted to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12287)|
| 3:24:51| a written amendment that was approved properly because it sure has put him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12291)|
| 3:24:55| in a difficult position also. And I would think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12295)|
| 3:24:59| a large business like this, if someone just sort of said, well, you don't have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12299)|
| 3:25:03| pay or you're not going to have to do what the contract says, is that they should have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12303)|
| 3:25:07| come back also and wanted to have a written agreement on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12307)|
| 3:25:11| what was occurring with this. I mean, it puts everybody in a bad position, not just the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12311)|
| 3:25:15| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12315)|
| 3:25:19| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12319)|
| 3:25:23| Mr. Draper, I've got three lights on and I'll get to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12323)|
| 3:25:27| Mr. Chairman, I think the point raised by Commissioner Briggs about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12327)|
| 3:25:31| that clause in the contract was in section 25, I remember reading that and thinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12331)|
| 3:25:35| this is very important. And the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12335)|
| 3:25:39| validity of contracts is important. The fact that we're a government of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12339)|
| 3:25:43| laws and not men and not just talking and winking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12343)|
| 3:25:47| in odd deals and making up excuses for not having paid and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12347)|
| 3:25:51| claiming they equal or exceed the amount owed. And for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12351)|
| 3:25:55| reason, I think it's more appropriate for us to change the nature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12355)|
| 3:25:59| of the motion before us. And I'd like to introduce a substitute motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12359)|
| 3:26:03| to disapprove the mediated settlement. I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12363)|
| 3:26:07| I suppose debate can continue, but I want it to continue under that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12367)|
| 3:26:11| We have a substitute motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12371)|
| 3:26:15| Are you finished? Yes, I am. Thank you. Commissioner Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12375)|
| 3:26:19| Yes, I just kind of wanted to follow up on something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12379)|
| 3:26:23| Mr. Greaves had said and also maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12383)|
| 3:26:27| I don't have my copy of the contract. Mr. McConkie, maybe you can answer this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12387)|
| 3:26:31| He had referred that with regard to revenue sharing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12391)|
| 3:26:35| that we were supposed to receive revenue share on all products| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12395)|
| 3:26:39| and that we are not receiving that on colored mulch. Can you speak to that, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12399)|
| 3:26:43| I'll try my best. As we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12403)|
| 3:26:47| mentioned in committee meetings last week, at the time this contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12407)|
| 3:26:51| began, the contractor got on site and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12411)|
| 3:26:55| Mr. Draper can address this and correct any errors that I make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12415)|
| 3:26:59| The contractor got on site and much of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12419)|
| 3:27:03| raw materials and some of the finished product that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12423)|
| 3:27:07| frankly the county and potential vendors had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12427)|
| 3:27:11| anticipated would be in place had in fact been removed and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12431)|
| 3:27:15| they weren't left with much in the way to get operations started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12435)|
| 3:27:19| It was part of the RFP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12439)|
| 3:27:23| process. I don't think we said within the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12443)|
| 3:27:27| contract that we were going to leave the materials when they started up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12447)|
| 3:27:31| It was not in the contract. What I'm saying is that was what the parties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12451)|
| 3:27:35| anticipated. That's what the county anticipated. That's what Solid Waste represented in the RFP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12455)|
| 3:27:39| process. But that wasn't in writing? Not to my knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12459)|
| 3:27:43| In any event, to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12463)|
| 3:27:47| help in the startup of operations apparently and to augment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12467)|
| 3:27:51| their sales initially as they got on the ground and running,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12471)|
| 3:27:55| it's my understanding that Natural Resources brought in finished| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12475)|
| 3:27:59| product. It was already finished and there was nothing to be done with it except to sell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12479)|
| 3:28:03| Specifically in the way of some colored mulch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12483)|
| 3:28:07| That is not something that the contract contemplates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12487)|
| 3:28:11| The contract contemplates that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12491)|
| 3:28:15| product that would be sold at the facility is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12495)|
| 3:28:19| product produced on site from green waste that is brought into the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12499)|
| 3:28:23| facility for recycling. So you had an area where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12503)|
| 3:28:27| frankly there was no contract provision that governed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12507)|
| 3:28:31| Mr. Mays and his counsel have taken the position that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12511)|
| 3:28:35| all products sold would include imported products such| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12515)|
| 3:28:39| as that. That is where we would have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12519)|
| 3:28:43| dispute and interpretation by a court if we have to litigate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12523)|
| 3:28:47| But you have disputed positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12527)|
| 3:28:51| Our interpretation of the contract frankly would be that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12531)|
| 3:28:55| one other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12535)|
| 3:28:59| reading of the contract that Natural Resources has offered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12539)|
| 3:29:03| in the course of mediating this case and negotiating has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12543)|
| 3:29:07| that based on a letter that John Evans sent them, the revenue sharing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12547)|
| 3:29:11| provision by Mr. Evans' own interpretation would have applied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12551)|
| 3:29:15| only to composted products and not to mulch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12555)|
| 3:29:19| We disagree with that based on the language of the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12559)|
| 3:29:23| We would assert that it applies to any products that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12563)|
| 3:29:28| result from the recycling of green waste there at the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12568)|
| 3:29:32| We think it is reasonably likely that a court would agree with them that it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12572)|
| 3:29:36| does not cover imported products that were not produced on site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12576)|
| 3:29:40| Okay, well let me follow up with that because in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12580)|
| 3:29:44| under number 7 of the mediated settlement on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12584)|
| 3:29:48| page 3, let's see what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12588)|
| 3:29:52| Covenants and Undertakings of Natural Resources, under number 7 it says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12592)|
| 3:29:56| that revenue sharing shall not apply to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12596)|
| 3:30:00| any products that are imported and resold without further processing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12600)|
| 3:30:04| Now, do they do tire shredding, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12604)|
| 3:30:08| Do they do any tire shredding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12608)|
| 3:30:12| They did at one time. They do not any longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12612)|
| 3:30:16| They receive tires for recycling. Mr. Draper, you could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12616)|
| 3:30:20| I don't think we ever shred. We never shred tire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12620)|
| 3:30:24| No, we don't receive tires anymore either. We did it one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12624)|
| 3:30:28| The county put the operation over there at Forks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12628)|
| 3:30:32| Okay, and so you just received tires and they sat there or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12632)|
| 3:30:36| somebody else could come pick them up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12636)|
| 3:30:40| Mr. Pop says we buried them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12640)|
| 3:30:44| So basically what would that apply to if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12644)|
| 3:30:48| it should not apply to any products that are imported and resold without further processing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12648)|
| 3:30:52| What products would that be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12652)|
| 3:30:56| I don't know that it would actually occur| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12656)|
| 3:31:00| because I don't believe they're doing it any longer, but as I said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12660)|
| 3:31:04| at one time they brought in finished products at the facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12664)|
| 3:31:08| to augment their sales such as top soils.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12668)|
| 3:31:12| At one time it was colored mulches. I think they actually now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12672)|
| 3:31:16| produce colored mulches on site, but if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12676)|
| 3:31:20| they brought in products. From where? Where would you bring in product from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12680)|
| 3:31:24| I'm just curious as to what this would actually apply to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12684)|
| 3:31:28| I think there was a letter. May I speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12688)|
| 3:31:32| I think there was a letter that I read from John Edwards where they had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12692)|
| 3:31:36| there was a mud slide and they brought in top soil there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12696)|
| 3:31:40| And the question was can that top soil be sold without paying the dollar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12700)|
| 3:31:44| or 50 per cubic yard? And his letter said that because it was not a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12704)|
| 3:31:48| finished product that they could just sell that and the county would not receive any money from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12708)|
| 3:31:52| I believe that's correct, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12712)|
| 3:31:56| I didn't hear the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12716)|
| 3:32:00| Commissioner Davis, let me see if I can answer your question for you. What the intent was that if natural resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12720)|
| 3:32:04| for instance, were to buy a tandem load of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12724)|
| 3:32:08| top soil to mix with some mulch as opposed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12728)|
| 3:32:12| bringing it in as a tipping fee, if they were to purchase it, they essentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12732)|
| 3:32:16| didn't want to have to pay a revenue share on materials. They purchased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12736)|
| 3:32:20| an import to augment a mulch product or some other product or to sell it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12740)|
| 3:32:24| in its natural state such as top soil. That's what that provision is to outline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12744)|
| 3:32:28| Okay, but if they purchase top soil and augment it with mulch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12748)|
| 3:32:32| that is a finished product that they would need to pay revenue share on, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12752)|
| 3:32:36| That is correct. The mulch portion of that would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12756)|
| 3:32:40| subject to the revenue share, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12760)|
| 3:32:44| So how do you divide out the top soil from the mulch?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12764)|
| 3:32:48| Through the quantities. Essentially converting the quantities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12768)|
| 3:32:52| as they come in, stuff that they're going to import, that they're going to pay for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12772)|
| 3:32:56| They're going to have to provide invoices to Knox County to verify this was imported| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12776)|
| 3:33:00| and it was paid for. And as it goes out, then it would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12780)|
| 3:33:04| deducted from the total. You would deduct the weight of the top soil| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12784)|
| 3:33:08| from the finished product? Actually, the volume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12788)|
| 3:33:12| The other...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12792)|
| 3:33:16| Commissioner, on that same point...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12796)|
| 3:33:20| That's an example of a very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12800)|
| 3:33:24| specific conversation that was had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12804)|
| 3:33:28| toward the end of the day on the second day in this mediation process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12808)|
| 3:33:32| The detail of how we got to an arrangement that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12812)|
| 3:33:36| palatable to both sides and how it would be managed, how it would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12816)|
| 3:33:40| overseen, and what it would involve. And that's the sort of thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12820)|
| 3:33:44| that's gone into this agreement. And I'm glad you asked that question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12824)|
| 3:33:48| because it reflects the level of detail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12828)|
| 3:33:52| and the level of discussion that went on in what is being projected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12832)|
| 3:33:56| as a sham deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12836)|
| 3:34:00| I just had one more question with regard to earthworks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12840)|
| 3:34:04| And I believe that probably some other commissioners may have received this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12844)|
| 3:34:08| fax as well. It was an invoice that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12848)|
| 3:34:12| earthworks paid NRR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12852)|
| 3:34:16| fee. And Bruce,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12856)|
| 3:34:20| you had said that basically they were just on site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12860)|
| 3:34:24| that John Evans had given them permission to be there. But this was an actual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12864)|
| 3:34:28| invoice from earthworks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12868)|
| 3:34:32| to NRR where they had paid a rental,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12872)|
| 3:34:36| some sort of rental fee. I don't have it with me. Did anybody else receive that fax?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12876)|
| 3:34:40| I'm not aware. Here's what I am aware of on earthworks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12880)|
| 3:34:44| After John Evans passed away, this site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12884)|
| 3:34:48| is about 162 acres. As you go up the hill, there's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12888)|
| 3:34:52| place off to the right that the previous contractor had used to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12892)|
| 3:34:56| store their equipment and to do maintenance on their equipment. When they moved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12896)|
| 3:35:00| off the site, evidently John gave earthworks permission to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12900)|
| 3:35:04| occupy that area. And I don't know the exact size. It's something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12904)|
| 3:35:08| you don't even notice. So after John passed away, we found| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12908)|
| 3:35:12| out that earthworks is actually out there outside our fenced area, but on Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12912)|
| 3:35:16| property. I asked Mr. Salter to find out essentially what was going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12916)|
| 3:35:20| and sure enough, they were on Knox County property. They did not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12920)|
| 3:35:24| have a contract. I'm not aware| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12924)|
| 3:35:28| of any rental they were paying. And as far as I know, it had nothing to do with natural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12928)|
| 3:35:32| resources. I'm not aware of any natural resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12932)|
| 3:35:36| subletting to get that number. We need to stay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12936)|
| 3:35:40| on the mediation agreement if we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12940)|
| 3:35:44| But isn't this part of the actual mediation agreement is the actual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12944)|
| 3:35:48| revenue and what sort of total revenue that we will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12948)|
| 3:35:52| receive? Biosolid is but one component of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12952)|
| 3:35:56| broad recycling program. Just one component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12956)|
| 3:36:00| And the analysis has been done. We tendered a proposal to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12960)|
| 3:36:04| the county, which we won. We're not asking that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12964)|
| 3:36:08| We went in a different direction with the mediation agreement. We understood that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12968)|
| 3:36:12| had to do it in order to get to a point of satisfaction and agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12972)|
| 3:36:16| We don't know everything that we will do tomorrow or the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12976)|
| 3:36:20| day or next year or three years from now with regard to the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12980)|
| 3:36:24| We have five and a half years of experience doing green waste| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12984)|
| 3:36:28| recycling with a composting component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12988)|
| 3:36:32| You know, the capacity of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12992)|
| 3:36:36| natural resources to pay is there. I didn't bring a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=12996)|
| 3:36:40| balance sheet down here today, but it's there and I can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13000)|
| 3:36:44| assure you it's been a matter of scrutiny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13004)|
| 3:36:48| I'm not so naive to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13008)|
| 3:36:52| not know what the wins are or what I detect is going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13012)|
| 3:36:56| in this forum. And I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13016)|
| 3:37:00| very regretful of it. I hope that there is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13020)|
| 3:37:04| majority of you that supports this mediated settlement agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13024)|
| 3:37:08| It's easy to attack it. It's easy to attack| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13028)|
| 3:37:12| us. We're an easy target. We're in a difficult business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13032)|
| 3:37:16| We're in a very difficult business. But we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13036)|
| 3:37:20| been doing it for five and a half years and I owe it to my client, Sid Bryan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13040)|
| 3:37:24| and I owe it to Gerald Barnett and his son, Sid's son| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13044)|
| 3:37:28| Blake Bryan and Jeannie Young, who are employees of this facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13048)|
| 3:37:32| out at Solway. They have been under a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13052)|
| 3:37:36| ruthless, malicious campaign for over a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13056)|
| 3:37:40| to attack them at every level. These people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13060)|
| 3:37:44| are veterans of this operation and they take great pride in what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13064)|
| 3:37:48| they do. And they do make good products. And for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13068)|
| 3:37:52| every TDEC violation that he wants to call it a violation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13072)|
| 3:37:56| there are just as many good ones. And they're sprinkled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13076)|
| 3:38:00| out throughout the TDEC file. And they say no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13080)|
| 3:38:04| violations. Everything in order. Operation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13084)|
| 3:38:08| looks good. Including this year where we're getting good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13088)|
| 3:38:12| reviews with TDEC. And it's exceedingly difficult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13092)|
| 3:38:16| to stand here and to try to turn the political wind around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13096)|
| 3:38:20| and to try to prevail with common sense. And he wants to suggest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13100)|
| 3:38:24| to you that we left common sense at the door when we went into mediation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13104)|
| 3:38:28| That's offensive. It's terribly offensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13108)|
| 3:38:32| He's the man who wants the operation. Of course I expect him to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13112)|
| 3:38:36| But I don't expect you to believe it. Not for a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13116)|
| 3:38:40| It was a very difficult mediation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13120)|
| 3:38:44| process with a veteran mediator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13124)|
| 3:38:48| And all of the paper was there. And Mr. Mays was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13128)|
| 3:38:52| And Mr. Alpert was there. And Mr. Salter. And Mr. Weitrick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13132)|
| 3:38:56| And Mr. Holt. And five representatives of this county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13136)|
| 3:39:00| signed this mediated settlement agreement. Five. Two lawyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13140)|
| 3:39:04| Two department heads. And a representative of county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13144)|
| 3:39:08| And we come in here and I hear discussion of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13148)|
| 3:39:12| retreating. Run away. Run away. We were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13152)|
| 3:39:16| told to go to mediation by this body. And we went| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13156)|
| 3:39:20| and we did it. And we did it in good faith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13160)|
| 3:39:24| And we addressed these issues. And now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13164)|
| 3:39:28| there's been an effort since it was publicized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13168)|
| 3:39:32| to lay it on. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13172)|
| 3:39:36| have done this. We've done that. We come in here to committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13176)|
| 3:39:40| last week and they bring up Mr. Popp. And I told you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13180)|
| 3:39:44| I talked to Mr. Popp a year ago about these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13184)|
| 3:39:48| But the point is the wells don't have anything at all to do with natural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13188)|
| 3:39:52| resources. The well of Mr. Popp and the ponds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13192)|
| 3:39:56| It's like throwing spaghetti on a wall to confuse you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13196)|
| 3:40:00| What are the issues? Your own law department and your outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13200)|
| 3:40:04| counsel, Mr. Farmer, who doesn't need me to stand up for his reputation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13204)|
| 3:40:08| have told you that the county is at risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13208)|
| 3:40:12| And they've told you that we have claims. I've never been in a lawsuit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13212)|
| 3:40:16| where the adverse party has admitted liability. Not in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13216)|
| 3:40:20| circumstance like this. And so you're forced to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13220)|
| 3:40:24| begin to look at contract terminology and to try to determine what a contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13224)|
| 3:40:28| means. And what are the risks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13228)|
| 3:40:32| He wants an audit. He wants another PCARD audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13232)|
| 3:40:36| The records have been produced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13236)|
| 3:40:40| My client went to the files and pulled out every record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13240)|
| 3:40:44| of everything ever received and sold. And we've produced it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13244)|
| 3:40:48| It's exhibited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13248)|
| 3:40:52| in this litigation. And yet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13252)|
| 3:40:56| you're being asked to play lawyer, to play law department, to play judge and jury| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13256)|
| 3:41:00| in the case of disputed contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13260)|
| 3:41:04| claims where the county admits fault and we admit fault. We have never| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13264)|
| 3:41:08| come in here and suggested to you that we were without fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13268)|
| 3:41:12| We were. But we're also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13272)|
| 3:41:16| a good contractor. And the mediated settlement agreement, as signed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13276)|
| 3:41:20| by five representatives of the county, states that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13280)|
| 3:41:24| And so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13284)|
| 3:41:28| I don't know how to turn around any given little issue. I can tell you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13288)|
| 3:41:32| that if you look in the files and if you read the transcripts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13292)|
| 3:41:36| not just the portions they want you to read, but all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13296)|
| 3:41:40| of it, if that's what you choose to do, you'll find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13300)|
| 3:41:44| that the mediated settlement agreement makes sense. This war,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13304)|
| 3:41:48| this COLA war, Commissioner Hammond, will go on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13308)|
| 3:41:52| and on and on. And I would pose this question to you. If you don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13312)|
| 3:41:56| approve this mediated settlement agreement, what then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13316)|
| 3:42:00| What do we do next? Can Knox County ever be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13320)|
| 3:42:04| trusted to go into mediation again with a party? And Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13324)|
| 3:42:08| gets sued a lot. We sat down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13328)|
| 3:42:12| We bargained. We signed an agreement. And I can assure you that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13332)|
| 3:42:16| when we left, we all understood that we had settled the dispute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13336)|
| 3:42:20| And we had done so in good faith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13340)|
| 3:42:24| And these folks will say whatever needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13344)|
| 3:42:28| to be said in order to undermine it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13348)|
| 3:42:32| I'm finished, Commissioner Davis. I'm finished. Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13352)|
| 3:42:36| Mr. Chairman, I just have a couple of quick questions, really three. First of all, Commissioner Moore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13356)|
| 3:42:40| when he was talking a while ago, he said that something changed, as I recall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13360)|
| 3:42:44| and you had asked Mr. McConkie perhaps he wanted to address that. He didn't address it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13364)|
| 3:42:48| I'd like to find out what that was about. I would rely on Mr. McConkie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13368)|
| 3:42:52| Mr. McConkie, can you tell us what that was about? He wants to address it. I don't. I mean, I'd just be interested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13372)|
| 3:42:56| to know. He has said something changed, and I would be interested to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13376)|
| 3:43:00| what that was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13380)|
| 3:43:04| Frankly, Commissioner, and I don't want to get into the details| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13384)|
| 3:43:08| of mediation discussions, because there's a line that can be crossed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13388)|
| 3:43:12| and sometimes, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13392)|
| 3:43:16| all the time, settlement discussions are considered confidential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13396)|
| 3:43:20| But I can tell you that at the time the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13400)|
| 3:43:24| mediated settlement agreement was signed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13404)|
| 3:43:28| there was a view, and frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13408)|
| 3:43:32| there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13412)|
| 3:43:36| support for the view, that the administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13416)|
| 3:43:40| the Solid Waste Department and the Purchasing Department, had the right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13420)|
| 3:43:44| under the contract to renew the contract without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13424)|
| 3:43:48| approval by County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13428)|
| 3:43:52| After mediation had concluded, and after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13432)|
| 3:43:56| further reflection and consultation with additional attorneys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13436)|
| 3:44:00| in our department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13440)|
| 3:44:04| we came to hold the view that in this particular case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13444)|
| 3:44:08| because of all of the particular circumstances and the fact that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13448)|
| 3:44:12| a proposed ground lease had been put out for bid and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13452)|
| 3:44:16| was on the agenda to be considered for this commission, and now we were considering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13456)|
| 3:44:20| a settlement agreement that would reverse course and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13460)|
| 3:44:24| result in the renewal and amendment, a significant amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13464)|
| 3:44:28| to the existing agreement, that that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13468)|
| 3:44:32| whole deal, the mediated settlement agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13472)|
| 3:44:36| which is predicated upon a renewal and amendment of the existing agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13476)|
| 3:44:40| that all needed to come back before this body and to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13480)|
| 3:44:44| considered by this body, and under all the facts and circumstances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13484)|
| 3:44:48| considering that it was this body that began the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13488)|
| 3:44:52| discussions of whether or not to terminate this agreement, that that was the proper thing to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13492)|
| 3:44:56| to bring it back to this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13496)|
| 3:45:00| Secondly, what audit did you do to determine these numbers? It's been stated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13500)|
| 3:45:04| that there was no audit. How did you arrive at the numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13504)|
| 3:45:08| for the $1.6 million that they feel is owed, plus what we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13508)|
| 3:45:12| feel is our liability as far as the county is concerned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13512)|
| 3:45:16| Okay. Let me try to answer it this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13516)|
| 3:45:20| The $1.6 million that was outlined,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13520)|
| 3:45:24| and again, Natural Resources didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13524)|
| 3:45:28| assert directly any breach of contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13528)|
| 3:45:32| claims against the county on its own. We knew we were going to mediation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13532)|
| 3:45:36| We knew that they had said they felt like they had potential claims against the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13536)|
| 3:45:40| county for breach of contract. We asked them, okay, if we're going to go to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13540)|
| 3:45:44| mediation, we need you to outline specifically for us what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13544)|
| 3:45:48| alleged breaches of contract you claim occurred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13548)|
| 3:45:52| and what would be the value of those claims.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13552)|
| 3:45:56| If you file the lawsuit today, what would your complaint ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13556)|
| 3:46:00| for? The $1.6 million is what they would ask for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13560)|
| 3:46:04| And it is based on their analysis of their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13564)|
| 3:46:08| lost profits and direct out-of-pocket expenses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13568)|
| 3:46:12| for what occurred. And that's not a matter that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13572)|
| 3:46:16| be audited, per se.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13576)|
| 3:46:20| The other discussion there's been about an audit is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13580)|
| 3:46:24| with regard to revenue sharing. And with all due respect to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13584)|
| 3:46:28| Mr. Greaves, and he wants to tell you that it's a simple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13588)|
| 3:46:32| matter of reading the contract. And we've read the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13592)|
| 3:46:36| I've been practicing law for 12 years. I certainly know how to read a contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13596)|
| 3:46:40| And I've been involved in lawsuits involving disputes over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13600)|
| 3:46:44| what you would think are the simplest words in contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13604)|
| 3:46:48| And they can go any particular way. There are disputes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13608)|
| 3:46:52| between the county and between natural resources over what the contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13612)|
| 3:46:56| means. It's not a matter of we don't know which number is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13616)|
| 3:47:00| It's a matter of you have the county on one side saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13620)|
| 3:47:04| $125,000 and you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13624)|
| 3:47:08| natural resources, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13628)|
| 3:47:12| not $125,000, and you have Brad Mays on the other saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13632)|
| 3:47:16| $250,000 to $300,000. And you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13636)|
| 3:47:20| natural resources taking the position that, look, if we litigate this case, we're going to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13640)|
| 3:47:24| the position that we don't owe anything because it was waived.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13644)|
| 3:47:28| We disagree with that. We strongly disagree with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13648)|
| 3:47:32| that. But there's no, you know, unless we can come to a settlement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13652)|
| 3:47:36| there's no resolution of that question without going to court and litigating it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13656)|
| 3:47:40| And if we do that, we put ourselves at great risk. Now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13660)|
| 3:47:44| the numbers that are being thrown around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13664)|
| 3:47:48| the $125,000, the $300,000 are based on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13668)|
| 3:47:52| their reports of product sales. And there's no dispute about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13672)|
| 3:47:56| their reports of product sales. Mr. Mays will tell you that he calculated $300,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13676)|
| 3:48:00| based on their report of product sales. And in fact, that's what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13680)|
| 3:48:04| the contract calls for is for them to file, to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13684)|
| 3:48:08| quarterly make a revenue sharing payment to the county and to file| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13688)|
| 3:48:12| with that payment, with their check, a report of what their sales for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13692)|
| 3:48:16| quarter were so that the county can verify that it's received the correct amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13696)|
| 3:48:20| That has not been audited by a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13700)|
| 3:48:24| CPA in any formal sense. It| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13704)|
| 3:48:28| could be done. The backup data exists, as I understand it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13708)|
| 3:48:32| to find out, you know, where those numbers came from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13712)|
| 3:48:36| and how it was calculated. But it's going to be on a transaction-by-transaction basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13716)|
| 3:48:40| and it covers a five-year period. It would be an extremely time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13720)|
| 3:48:44| intensive and expensive undertaking to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13724)|
| 3:48:48| do that. We've gone through what I would call the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13728)|
| 3:48:52| litigation discovery process rather than auditing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13732)|
| 3:48:56| And again, that could be done in the future, but you're talking about a lot of time and a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13736)|
| 3:49:00| A final question is, let's say that this agreement is turned down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13740)|
| 3:49:04| Natural Resource Recovery would operate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13744)|
| 3:49:08| until July 31. Is that correct? Because we'd given them 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13748)|
| 3:49:12| If we turn it down today, they would operate until the 31st. Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13752)|
| 3:49:16| At that point, would we have to give them an extra| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13756)|
| 3:49:20| 30 days to operate if they chose to or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13760)|
| 3:49:24| six months or whatever? I mean, we would need to do something out there, wouldn't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13764)|
| 3:49:28| They may choose just to say, hey, if you turned us down, we're out of here. That's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13768)|
| 3:49:32| correct. But would this be re-bid at that point? We would have to go through another re-bid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13772)|
| 3:49:36| process? Well, if the settlement agreement were turned down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13776)|
| 3:49:40| I imagine the next matter that you'll take up is the ground lease. And assuming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13780)|
| 3:49:44| that that was denied, then yes, I think it would have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13784)|
| 3:49:48| be put out for bid unless some agreement could be reached| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13788)|
| 3:49:52| with Natural Resources. And frankly, if the settlement agreement is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13792)|
| 3:49:56| rejected, I can't imagine what agreement can be reached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13796)|
| 3:50:00| Basically, if we were to turn down this agreement, as I see it, they would have nothing to lose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13800)|
| 3:50:04| to file a lawsuit against Knox County. I mean, there would be no reason for them not to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13804)|
| 3:50:08| if they wanted to. I mean, they had nothing to lose at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13808)|
| 3:50:12| I hate to take a position on that, but my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13812)|
| 3:50:16| opinion is if this body, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13816)|
| 3:50:20| asked us to go to mediation and come back with a proposed settlement, and we've done that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13820)|
| 3:50:24| and you've heard about all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13824)|
| 3:50:28| county representatives who attended, and frankly, those representatives who attended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13828)|
| 3:50:32| including myself, I'm a county lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13832)|
| 3:50:36| I'm an attorney in the county law department, and my license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13836)|
| 3:50:40| and my job is to give legal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13840)|
| 3:50:44| advice based on my professional judgment as to what is in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13844)|
| 3:50:48| the county's best legal interests. And I've done that, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13848)|
| 3:50:52| you're hearing opposition from parties who have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13852)|
| 3:50:56| both personal and business reasons to want you to reject it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13856)|
| 3:51:00| But yes, if that settlement agreement is rejected, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13860)|
| 3:51:04| we're inviting litigation against the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13864)|
| 3:51:08| How many people bid on this? Because you put it up for bid, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13868)|
| 3:51:12| You had four people? Yes, sir, I believe that's correct. Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13872)|
| 3:51:16| Can I make one final point? And it coincides with what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13876)|
| 3:51:20| Mr. McConkie said. I want to emphasize this point. It cannot be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13880)|
| 3:51:24| lost in this discussion. If| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13884)|
| 3:51:28| everything that you're hearing somehow, someday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13888)|
| 3:51:32| amounts to something, you retain the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13892)|
| 3:51:36| right to terminate natural resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13896)|
| 3:51:40| You're not ceding that right. You can do it next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13900)|
| 3:51:44| You can do it tomorrow. If you approve the mediated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13904)|
| 3:51:48| settlement agreement, you are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13908)|
| 3:51:52| by definition resolving the past issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13912)|
| 3:51:56| and the principal issue of revenue share, which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13916)|
| 3:52:00| what all of the real focus of the discussion has been about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13920)|
| 3:52:04| And we focus specifically on that in the mediation process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13924)|
| 3:52:08| The county retains the right to terminate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13928)|
| 3:52:12| natural resources if all of the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13932)|
| 3:52:16| that they want to thrust upon you prove to be true, and I would suggest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13936)|
| 3:52:20| to you they are not. You still have the capacity to terminate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13940)|
| 3:52:24| natural resources. We went through a process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13944)|
| 3:52:28| we honored that process, and we're asking Knox County to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13948)|
| 3:52:32| honor that process. I'm going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13952)|
| 3:52:36| to hear that gentleman right in the front. Do you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13956)|
| 3:52:40| My name is Raymond Popp| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13960)|
| 3:52:44| and I live at 9901 Emory Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13964)|
| 3:52:48| and I'm adjacent to the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13968)|
| 3:52:52| You've heard a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13972)|
| 3:52:56| from various parties here, and you've heard a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13976)|
| 3:53:00| which is true, and you've heard a lot which has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13980)|
| 3:53:04| filtered and doesn't represent all of the facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13984)|
| 3:53:08| I'm going to take just a few minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13988)|
| 3:53:12| to review a few things that I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13992)|
| 3:53:16| will answer the question that was raised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=13996)|
| 3:53:20| an hour or so ago as to why people don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14000)|
| 3:53:24| really trust the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14004)|
| 3:53:28| Early on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14008)|
| 3:53:32| I interacted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14012)|
| 3:53:36| with John Evans and Ken Eckert and tried| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14016)|
| 3:53:40| in a very gentlemanly, reasonable way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14020)|
| 3:53:44| to get information from them, and for the most part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14024)|
| 3:53:48| everything was very evasive. I couldn't get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14028)|
| 3:53:52| straight answers from them for anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14032)|
| 3:53:56| So I started to write letters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14036)|
| 3:54:00| My first letter was on the 17th of February| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14040)|
| 3:54:04| 2003, requesting information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14044)|
| 3:54:08| on what was going to be in that facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14048)|
| 3:54:12| Now, later on, there was a request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14052)|
| 3:54:16| for biosolids. That was not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14056)|
| 3:54:20| in the original agreement whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14060)|
| 3:54:24| I informed John Evans and I informed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14064)|
| 3:54:28| this commission a couple years ago that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14068)|
| 3:54:32| had shipped in manure from the zoo| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14072)|
| 3:54:36| prior to the time that they had a permit to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14076)|
| 3:54:40| John Evans' answer to me was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14080)|
| 3:54:44| it was only about 40 tons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14084)|
| 3:54:48| that they brought in there to see if it could be mixed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14088)|
| 3:54:52| and be of benefit to the processing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14092)|
| 3:54:56| You have heard that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14096)|
| 3:55:00| for the most part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14100)|
| 3:55:04| the fecal coliform counts have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14104)|
| 3:55:08| very reasonable. There are records that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14108)|
| 3:55:12| TDEC has a KUB analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14112)|
| 3:55:16| from the 11th month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14116)|
| 3:55:20| 18th day, 2003| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14120)|
| 3:55:24| through a period in 2005| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14124)|
| 3:55:28| that I have on file.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14128)|
| 3:55:32| In the early part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14132)|
| 3:55:36| where there are anywhere from 500 to 2,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14136)|
| 3:55:40| colony forming units per 100 milliliters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14140)|
| 3:55:44| of fluid, that's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14144)|
| 3:55:48| within the limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14148)|
| 3:55:52| Tom Salter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14152)|
| 3:55:56| came out and talked to me last week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14156)|
| 3:56:00| after the meeting here and he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14160)|
| 3:56:04| selected some very specific data to present| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14164)|
| 3:56:08| to me with regards to the coliform counts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14168)|
| 3:56:12| which were in the secondary pond. But he didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14172)|
| 3:56:16| choose to mention that there were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14176)|
| 3:56:20| 59,000 colony forming units in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14180)|
| 3:56:24| secondary pond on the 9th of March| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14184)|
| 3:56:28| 2004.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14188)|
| 3:56:32| He also told me that there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14192)|
| 3:56:36| was one break at the time that they had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14196)|
| 3:56:40| the so-called collapse in the system. If you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14200)|
| 3:56:44| read the reports of TDEC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14204)|
| 3:56:48| starting at 7-23-04| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14208)|
| 3:56:52| they reported| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14212)|
| 3:56:56| a collapse in the berm of Pond 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14216)|
| 3:57:00| They say that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14220)|
| 3:57:04| that occurred while stabilizing a berm collapse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14224)|
| 3:57:08| in Pond 2. On 7-30-04| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14228)|
| 3:57:12| TDEC says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14232)|
| 3:57:16| that the upper pond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14236)|
| 3:57:20| is holding water, but a third collapse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14240)|
| 3:57:24| is being studied. My wife asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14244)|
| 3:57:28| Tom how many collapses there were and he said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14248)|
| 3:57:32| one. Now you can think of these as three events| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14252)|
| 3:57:36| in the same area being a single incident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14256)|
| 3:57:40| Let me tell you that from about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14260)|
| 3:57:44| 1985, no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14264)|
| 3:57:48| a little earlier than that, about 1982| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14268)|
| 3:57:52| to 87, living right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14272)|
| 3:57:56| next door, I had about 25 head of cattle on that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14276)|
| 3:58:00| and cut hay off from there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14280)|
| 3:58:04| so I'm very familiar with the area. In the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14284)|
| 3:58:08| place where they built that pond, there was a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14288)|
| 3:58:12| three foot opening where when it rained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14292)|
| 3:58:16| water came out of there, very much like it would out of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14296)|
| 3:58:20| three foot culvert, but it never filled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14300)|
| 3:58:24| the area down below it. It didn't make a pond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14304)|
| 3:58:28| because the water went into another sinkhole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14308)|
| 3:58:32| and went down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14312)|
| 3:58:36| Any engineer doing a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14316)|
| 3:58:40| pond preparation in that area should have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14320)|
| 3:58:44| recognized that three foot opening and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14324)|
| 3:58:48| when I asked about the possibility of having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14328)|
| 3:58:52| an environmental statement made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14332)|
| 3:58:56| or a study done, Tom Evans told me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14336)|
| 3:59:00| it wasn't necessary, but I can tell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14340)|
| 3:59:04| you that I believe that what happened was they just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14344)|
| 3:59:08| covered that over, not knowing, not investigating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14348)|
| 3:59:12| what the nature of the structure was, although they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14352)|
| 3:59:16| had been told that there were caves underneath| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14356)|
| 3:59:20| that whole area. Sir, you have one minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14360)|
| 3:59:24| Okay. I want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14364)|
| 3:59:28| to make a statement that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14368)|
| 3:59:32| on the 20th of January| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14372)|
| 3:59:36| in 2005, when I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14376)|
| 3:59:40| came from Middle Tennessee, I have a farm over there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14380)|
| 3:59:44| they began piling material up next to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14384)|
| 3:59:48| my fence line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14388)|
| 3:59:52| I called John Eckert and John Eckert and Mr. Evans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14392)|
| 3:59:56| came out and one other person, and I don't know who that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14396)|
| 4:00:00| was, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14400)|
| 4:00:04| they told me that the material that they were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14404)|
| 4:00:08| taking up there and putting on bare ground was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14408)|
| 4:00:12| required further processing and that it would then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14412)|
| 4:00:16| be removed. On the 4th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14416)|
| 4:00:20| of March in 2005, Mr. Eckert| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14420)|
| 4:00:24| came up there and he told me that it was going to take about 6 weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14424)|
| 4:00:28| to complete the composting and only then could we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14428)|
| 4:00:32| expect the odor to be reduced, and he said at that time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14432)|
| 4:00:36| that the pile next to our house would be planted in grass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14436)|
| 4:00:40| and not be moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14440)|
| 4:00:44| I contacted Betsy Child, who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14444)|
| 4:00:48| is with the EPA in Nashville, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14448)|
| 4:00:52| again requested an environmental impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14452)|
| 4:00:56| study be done. Sir, you do need to wrap it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14456)|
| 4:01:00| She called me and talked to me, but she had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14460)|
| 4:01:04| her assistant, Karen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14464)|
| 4:01:08| Stokowski, write a letter to me in which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14468)|
| 4:01:12| she says that they were aware of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14472)|
| 4:01:16| presence of the sinkholes and the issues which I had raised,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14476)|
| 4:01:20| but that the placement of material near your property was not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14480)|
| 4:01:24| part of the permit as approved by the division| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14484)|
| 4:01:28| and that the county is being required to delineate exactly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14488)|
| 4:01:32| where processed and unprocessed materials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14492)|
| 4:01:36| are to be stored and to demonstrate that there's been no impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14496)|
| 4:01:40| on the environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14500)|
| 4:01:44| What they did was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14504)|
| 4:01:48| take compost up there, and I've got photographs of a large| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14508)|
| 4:01:52| pile of fly ash, tons of it, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14512)|
| 4:01:56| had high arsenic counts in it, and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14516)|
| 4:02:00| processed that stuff, flattened it out, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14520)|
| 4:02:04| put dirt over the top of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14524)|
| 4:02:08| A recycling facility does not bury stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14528)|
| 4:02:12| Early| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14532)|
| 4:02:16| in March of 2007,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14536)|
| 4:02:20| Sid called me, wanted to rent my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14540)|
| 4:02:24| house. At the same time, they were carrying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14544)|
| 4:02:28| additional material up there and placing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14548)|
| 4:02:32| it in a place that they did not have a permit to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14552)|
| 4:02:36| it. I would say that they are in violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14556)|
| 4:02:40| They have not done what TDEC has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14560)|
| 4:02:44| asked them to do to comply with the permit that they had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14564)|
| 4:02:48| and I would not in any way renew| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14568)|
| 4:02:52| the contract. Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14572)|

| 4:03:20| This contract is of such multitude, I'm not sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14600)|
| 4:03:24| that I have a personal interest or a conflict in this, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14604)|
| 4:03:28| it does give me concern, so I'm not going to be able to vote on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14608)|

| 4:04:40| Commissioner Pinkston. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14680)|
| 4:04:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14694)|
| 4:05:06| Motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14706)|
| 4:05:10| Eight, nine, and one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14710)|
| 4:05:14| Did you have something else, Commissioner Pinkston? Yes, this is for Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14714)|
| 4:05:18| McConkie. Mr. McConkie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14718)|
| 4:05:22| you said that this pad was to be built later on in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14722)|
| 4:05:26| When did we open the forks of the river? I'm sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14726)|
| 4:05:30| can you state that again? In the forks of the river where we're out of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14730)|
| 4:05:34| compliance with, when did we open that? I would have to defer to Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14734)|
| 4:05:38| Weitrich on that. It's been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14738)|
| 4:05:42| open. I mean, I don't think I understand your question. When did we open it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14742)|
| 4:05:46| It was not opened in the year 2000, was it, or 2002?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14746)|
| 4:05:50| I do not know exactly when it was opened. I would imagine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14750)|
| 4:05:54| there was, we were on site when we signed this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14754)|
| 4:05:58| contract, or we wouldn't have referenced it on there, because we have a convenience center out there also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14758)|
| 4:06:02| and the adjoining property is tied to this, so we've been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14762)|
| 4:06:06| out there prior to 2002. At the forks of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14766)|
| 4:06:10| river? Yes, sir, because we have a convenience center out there. I understand that, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14770)|
| 4:06:14| when we gave them this contract, were we at the forks of the river at that time? Yes, sir, I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14774)|
| 4:06:18| we were. That's all I want to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14778)|
| 4:06:22| Commissioner McKenzie? I've got a couple questions, hopefully short| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14782)|
| 4:06:26| primarily for Bruce, Mr. Weitrich.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14786)|
| 4:06:30| You talked a little bit about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14790)|
| 4:06:34| TDEC, and they come monthly, that's correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14794)|
| 4:06:38| Yes, sir, that's my understanding. Plus additional kind of surprise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14798)|
| 4:06:42| visits. That's correct. That's because of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14802)|
| 4:06:46| permit? That is correct. That's the sole driver?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14806)|
| 4:06:50| Yes, sir, that is correct. So going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14810)|
| 4:06:54| July 1, how many visits would TDEC be making?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14814)|
| 4:06:58| As long as we have a composting permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14818)|
| 4:07:02| I don't know how many, I don't know what their policy, I'm assuming they're required to go out there once| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14822)|
| 4:07:06| a month, and then spot visits as they seem necessary, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14826)|
| 4:07:10| as long as we have a composting permit, they will continue to come out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14830)|
| 4:07:14| And then, so does the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14834)|
| 4:07:18| three-year contract, it ends composting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14838)|
| 4:07:22| the way it's done, but does it allow? It ends the introduction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14842)|
| 4:07:26| of biosolids into composting. And that's all it does?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14846)|
| 4:07:30| That is correct. In terms of their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14850)|
| 4:07:34| process, TDEC I'm speaking of, their process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14854)|
| 4:07:38| and when they find things both good and bad, could you discuss this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14858)|
| 4:07:42| I mean it seemed like there was a conflict in whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14862)|
| 4:07:46| there were violations, findings, opportunities for improvements, could you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14866)|
| 4:07:50| discuss that? Let me probably narrow it down. I think when it gets down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14870)|
| 4:07:54| to actual testing and test results, they didn't, we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14874)|
| 4:07:58| never been fined or had threatened our permit to be revoked because we were selling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14878)|
| 4:08:02| hazardous product out there. We were in a continual, there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14882)|
| 4:08:06| was always a continual discussion going on about material| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14886)|
| 4:08:10| that would be allowed on the pad, whether we would be allowed to use the pond water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14890)|
| 4:08:14| to put on material that's in the process of being processed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14894)|
| 4:08:18| When we submitted, when Knox County submitted for our permit, we clearly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14898)|
| 4:08:22| stated in our permit application that we intended to use that pond water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14902)|
| 4:08:26| to put on material that was in the process of cooking, for lack of a better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14906)|
| 4:08:30| word. And TDEC approved that. Later on, they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14910)|
| 4:08:34| reversed themselves, or I don't know how else to characterize it, they decided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14914)|
| 4:08:38| that was not something we should be doing. And so they would cite that in a violation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14918)|
| 4:08:42| but our original permit clearly stated that's what we intended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14922)|
| 4:08:46| to do. So in the same material, and because this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14926)|
| 4:08:50| kind of a new process, this composting was new, it was a learning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14930)|
| 4:08:54| curve for everyone, there was continual discussion about what could be on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14934)|
| 4:08:58| a concrete pad, and the reason for that is whatever's on the concrete pad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14938)|
| 4:09:02| drains to these ponds, which are lined, so it's contained. And what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14942)|
| 4:09:06| could be off the pad? For instance, the mulch you buy and the mulch that you get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14946)|
| 4:09:10| in the other place, it can be placed anywhere. I mean, it doesn't have to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14950)|
| 4:09:14| on the pad. So we had product that we felt like was no more hazardous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14954)|
| 4:09:18| than regular mulch, so we should be allowed to put that off the pad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14958)|
| 4:09:22| So that was a running battle, and I think finally TDEC just snapped the line and said, uh-uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14962)|
| 4:09:26| everything goes on the pad, you either put it on the pad, expand the pad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14966)|
| 4:09:30| or get it out of here. And they finally came to a head. And that was back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14970)|
| 4:09:34| probably sometime early last summer, or maybe early in the spring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14974)|
| 4:09:38| Okay, and final question, and it actually has to do with the ponds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14978)|
| 4:09:42| So was there a decrease in volume| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14982)|
| 4:09:46| in the size of the pond pre-lining, pre-sinkhole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14986)|
| 4:09:50| and post-lining sinkhole? Yeah, what happened is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14990)|
| 4:09:54| and let me make sure everyone's clear on the pond, the pond number one clearly had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14994)|
| 4:09:58| a sinkhole in it. Pond number two had some berm failures. We could not detect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=14998)|
| 4:10:02| that anything really leaked out of pond number two. Pond number two is the primary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15002)|
| 4:10:06| pond. That's where, if you're going to say bad stuff, that's where it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15006)|
| 4:10:10| going to go. It clearly needed work, but we couldn't detect that there was a complete| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15010)|
| 4:10:14| failure where it was getting into the groundwater. Pond number one, no question about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15014)|
| 4:10:18| When we had to go in and do the lining of the pond, and putting in these liners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15018)|
| 4:10:22| is very similar to putting in, if you have a swimming pool, it's the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15022)|
| 4:10:26| You've got to go in and grade the site, essentially to a swimming pool| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15026)|
| 4:10:30| grade type thing. In doing so, the pond size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15030)|
| 4:10:34| had to be reduced just by virtue of getting the topography such| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15034)|
| 4:10:38| that we could put the liners in the pond. What is the order?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15038)|
| 4:10:42| Magnitude, factor of two, what size reduction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15042)|
| 4:10:46| Initially, the ponds were sized for a 100-year storm. It's my understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15046)|
| 4:10:50| I may be incorrect about this, I'm not an expert on the regulations. My understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15050)|
| 4:10:54| from a regulatory standpoint, TDEC wants a 25-year pond volume| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15054)|
| 4:10:58| out there. There is a 25-year pond volume out there. What we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15058)|
| 4:11:02| is we pump off the excess and we take it to the appropriate treatment plant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15062)|
| 4:11:06| and it's treated. But in lining the ponds, the pond's volume| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15066)|
| 4:11:10| was reduced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15070)|
| 4:11:14| Really my last question this time. So does that affect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15074)|
| 4:11:18| the volume of, did it, I guess in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15078)|
| 4:11:22| affect the volume of material that can be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15082)|
| 4:11:26| processed? It probably didn't affect the volume| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15086)|
| 4:11:30| of material being processed. The pond size didn't, but it did do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15090)|
| 4:11:34| In order for Knox County to expand the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15094)|
| 4:11:38| pad, then essentially it's a direct correlation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15098)|
| 4:11:42| The pond would definitely have to be expanded. And probably a new pond would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15102)|
| 4:11:46| to be built or something along those lines. So indirectly, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15106)|
| 4:11:50| It does affect the amount of product that you can bring onto the site, because I would have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15110)|
| 4:11:54| enlarge the pad, and in doing so, have to also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15114)|
| 4:11:58| enlarge the ponds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15118)|
| 4:12:02| Question of Smith. Yeah, just a quick question. We're talking about the mediated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15122)|
| 4:12:06| settlement, and I see we've got Mr. Bosch here. I'm going to ask you a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15126)|
| 4:12:10| You and I have not talked about this, have we? I just saw you out here. We have not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15130)|
| 4:12:14| talked about the settlement or anything. We've heard from two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15134)|
| 4:12:18| different attorneys. Here's what concerns me and I brought up earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15138)|
| 4:12:22| If something comes back to bite us in the tail four or five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15142)|
| 4:12:26| years from now, and we let them off on this mediation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15146)|
| 4:12:30| to Knox County, it's going to come back to get Knox County. In your opinion, if something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15150)|
| 4:12:34| comes up with TDAC, EPA, or anybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15154)|
| 4:12:38| next month, three or four years from now, and we let them off the hook now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15158)|
| 4:12:42| then we're the ones left on the hook. I think there is an analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15162)|
| 4:12:46| that is very consistent with what you've just said, Commissioner. My concern would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15166)|
| 4:12:50| is that the nature of this agreement, that is the nature between Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15170)|
| 4:12:54| and the person it chooses to contract its mulch operation with, in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15174)|
| 4:12:58| case NRR, is that of a partnership. It's not of an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15178)|
| 4:13:02| independent contractor. It's not of an in-source contractor. It's of a partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15182)|
| 4:13:06| And if NRR is released by Knox County, that leaves Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15186)|
| 4:13:10| County, in my opinion, as the sole sort of deep pocket| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15190)|
| 4:13:14| for a citizen, for an agency, for any aggrieved person or plaintiff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15194)|
| 4:13:18| to come after. And the right may be for Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15198)|
| 4:13:22| County to come back against NRR, possibly, if we've not released them of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15202)|
| 4:13:26| But if NRR chooses not to do that, chooses to litigate it, or can't do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15206)|
| 4:13:30| then you're right. Knox County will be the one to look to to make this right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15210)|
| 4:13:34| It should be a no-brainer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15214)|
| 4:13:38| If I could, what I'd like to say, and again, for the record, my name is Don| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15218)|
| 4:13:42| Bosch, 712 South Yates Street, 37902. And my firm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15222)|
| 4:13:46| and myself have been hired by Randy Grieve and his businesses to evaluate this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15226)|
| 4:13:50| and to advise him appropriately. We likewise have, and I will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15230)|
| 4:13:54| tell County Commission if they would like to call on him, we have John Lank here in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15234)|
| 4:13:58| the office, or excuse me, here in the audience. Mr. Lank, he's been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15238)|
| 4:14:02| in my office for quite some time, but Mr. Lank is a retired| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15242)|
| 4:14:06| environmental engineer with the EPA. He likewise has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15246)|
| 4:14:10| evaluated the documents in this standing and is prepared to answer questions from that perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15250)|
| 4:14:14| should County Commission wish to do that. That said, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15254)|
| 4:14:18| it's safe to say that all of us have detected a general loss of the will to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15258)|
| 4:14:22| live talking about mulch here this afternoon, and I'm going to try to bring this to a head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15262)|
| 4:14:26| This is the one thing that has become abundantly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15266)|
| 4:14:30| clear by all parties, and I appreciate the candor of the Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15270)|
| 4:14:34| Law Department on particular issues. I appreciate the candor of Mr. Draper as it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15274)|
| 4:14:38| relates to his client. Make no mistake, I'm here as an advocate for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15278)|
| 4:14:42| Randy Grieve, but I've also had an opportunity to evaluate it, and I stand behind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15282)|
| 4:14:46| what I'm about to say. There's no question that NRR has not been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15286)|
| 4:14:50| a good contractor for Knox County. There are many mistakes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15290)|
| 4:14:54| That's been addressed. Commissioner Hammond pointed it out very early. Mr. Draper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15294)|
| 4:14:58| admitted to some of those mistakes, albeit, and without putting words in his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15298)|
| 4:15:02| mouth, admitted he believes, and understandably, that his client's also done some things right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15302)|
| 4:15:06| But what we know by way of this mediated settlement is we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15306)|
| 4:15:10| agreed to extend a contract with NRR for three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15310)|
| 4:15:14| You are strapped to the rocket of NRR for the next three years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15314)|
| 4:15:18| if you approve this mediated agreement. You may be able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15318)|
| 4:15:22| get out of this contract with NRR if you can find a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15322)|
| 4:15:26| four-cause provision, but just as this commission may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15326)|
| 4:15:30| have concerns about litigation, and litigation if they do not approve it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15330)|
| 4:15:34| I assure you there would be litigation if you tried to get out of this contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15334)|
| 4:15:38| later should you determine there was, quote, four cause. There are no other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15338)|
| 4:15:42| descriptions of four cause. I can assure you that as a matter of course| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15342)|
| 4:15:46| that if that agreement's tried to breach, you're exposing yourself to the risk of litigation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15346)|
| 4:15:50| at the same level that you would be exposing yourselves today no matter what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15350)|
| 4:15:54| action you take. What we know is that NRR has demonstrated a pattern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15354)|
| 4:15:58| of fiscal irresponsibility in paying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15358)|
| 4:16:02| our taxpayers the money due by way of the contract. We know that there have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15362)|
| 4:16:06| been approximately 30 violations over an 18-month period decided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15366)|
| 4:16:10| by TDEC. And we also know that the nature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15370)|
| 4:16:14| of this relationship, the contract that is structured between Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15374)|
| 4:16:18| County and its contractor, whoever it be, be it Randy Grieve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15378)|
| 4:16:22| be it NRR, or be it some other party, is dangerous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15382)|
| 4:16:26| and fraught with peril. And that is so because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15386)|
| 4:16:30| it is a partnership. It exposes Knox County and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15390)|
| 4:16:34| its citizens to the same liability that NRR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15394)|
| 4:16:38| poses by way of doing whatever they do. NRR or anyone else. Not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15398)|
| 4:16:42| pointing directly to NRR. I urge you not to accept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15402)|
| 4:16:46| this mediated agreement because it is bad practice and bad business for our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15406)|
| 4:16:50| county. You have an opportunity here today to start over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15410)|
| 4:16:54| Start this process over. Do not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15414)|
| 4:16:58| approve this mediated agreement. Let this matter go back to RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15418)|
| 4:17:02| If you have concerns about what happens to Knox County's mulching operation, you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15422)|
| 4:17:06| several options. And I will make sure that they're understood here today. One,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15426)|
| 4:17:10| we are good through the end of this month. That is a very short time. Two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15430)|
| 4:17:14| if County Commission so chooses and NRR were to accept, you can continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15434)|
| 4:17:18| to extend them on a 30-day basis. If they would not accept,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15438)|
| 4:17:22| Mr. Grieve stands ready to step in either at your facility or his facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15442)|
| 4:17:26| and I might point out that he is the largest mulching| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15446)|
| 4:17:30| contractor in the country, processes more mulch than the State of New York| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15450)|
| 4:17:34| or City of New York. He's prepared to step in on a month-to-month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15454)|
| 4:17:38| basis on exactly the same terms that you've been doing this with NRR until| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15458)|
| 4:17:42| this Commission decides who it is that's going to possess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15462)|
| 4:17:46| and have the contract for mulching. And again, I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15466)|
| 4:17:50| urge this Commission that as you evaluate that process, that you instruct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15470)|
| 4:17:54| your law department to look at this from another perspective other than a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15474)|
| 4:17:58| partnership to protect this body, this government, and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15478)|
| 4:18:02| citizens of Knox County from the liabilities that one might incur| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15482)|
| 4:18:06| by undertaking these kinds of operations. Go back to the beginning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15486)|
| 4:18:10| make this right, call the question, vote this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15490)|
| 4:18:14| and start over. I stand ready for any questions or I'll take a seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15494)|
| 4:18:18| Yes, I have a question. I guess this would be for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15498)|
| 4:18:22| Mr. Grieves there. Mr. Grieves. Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15502)|
| 4:18:26| Yes, sir. Could you give us a rough estimate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15506)|
| 4:18:30| on this contract, how much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15510)|
| 4:18:34| money Knox County would possibly make per year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15514)|
| 4:18:38| If you had it, if you had the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15518)|
| 4:18:42| The contract, what I bid was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15522)|
| 4:18:46| I would pay $4,000 a month to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15526)|
| 4:18:50| the county itself, but I offered the Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15530)|
| 4:18:54| County taxpayer a lower tip fee than did natural resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15534)|
| 4:18:58| In fact, if you balance the two and use reasonable estimates based upon what people seem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15538)|
| 4:19:02| to think green waste might be, the dollars between the two are negligible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15542)|
| 4:19:06| And it makes no difference to me whether I take the fee arrangement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15546)|
| 4:19:10| that NRR put forth or whether you use the one that I put forth because to the taxpayer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15550)|
| 4:19:14| it makes very little difference. Well, the reason why I was asking this, sir,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15554)|
| 4:19:18| is Mr. McAulkey said we could possibly, they were going to be sued for a million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15558)|
| 4:19:22| point six. Yes, sir. I was wondering if you could give an estimate of how long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15562)|
| 4:19:26| if they did get judgment against us, how long it might take Knox County to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15566)|
| 4:19:30| that back with your contract. I don't think you'll ever make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15570)|
| 4:19:34| a million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15574)|
| 4:19:38| We're supposed to start zoning at six o'clock and we're going to start pretty close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15578)|
| 4:19:42| Commissioner Moore. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15582)|
| 4:19:46| Mr. Bosch, if you could come back to the podium. Mr. Chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15586)|
| 4:19:50| before you rule me out of order, Mr. Bosch, just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15590)|
| 4:19:54| on a side note, yesterday you made a comment about me supporting someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15594)|
| 4:19:58| in an election or was not supporting someone. I'm a Republican. I'm supporting Mr. Arnett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15598)|
| 4:20:02| Now, with saying that, it's hard to sometimes, I don't want to challenge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15602)|
| 4:20:06| your integrity, but, I mean, if someone told you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15606)|
| 4:20:10| that, I mean, you certainly, I would appreciate a call before you put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15610)|
| 4:20:14| out on TV I'm not supporting my fellow Republican. I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15614)|
| 4:20:18| I took that information from these very meetings and my viewing of community TV and if I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15618)|
| 4:20:22| in error, I apologize, but I stand by my comments. And back to the issue at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15622)|
| 4:20:26| hand. Hey, if we're going to have a talk radio show,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15626)|
| 4:20:30| let's sell some advertising. Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15630)|
| 4:20:34| Mr. Pinkston, can I clarify one thing? Commissioner Hammond, you have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15634)|
| 4:20:38| I'd like to add a friendly amendment to Commissioner Pinkston| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15638)|
| 4:20:42| and that is that it be denied but that there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15642)|
| 4:20:46| be an extension of 30 days to natural resource recovery under Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15646)|
| 4:20:50| If you'd accept that as a friendly amendment, that there be an extension of 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15650)|
| 4:20:54| should NRR choose to do that. And failing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15654)|
| 4:20:58| that, an extension of 30 days under the same terms offered to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15658)|
| 4:21:02| NOXAG. Would that be acceptable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15662)|
| 4:21:06| Would that be acceptable, Mr. Law Director, as an amendment? No, not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15666)|
| 4:21:10| No, we were talking about the fact of having a 30-day extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15670)|
| 4:21:14| Why don't we just extend the contract that we just currently have? I think it's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15674)|
| 4:21:18| easiest way to do it. Just extend the contract we have for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15678)|
| 4:21:22| Well, shouldn't we vote first on the settlement agreement and then the contract? I mean, that way we could do this thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15682)|
| 4:21:26| separately? If we do the 30 days, we have to, it's my understanding, we have to come back and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15686)|
| 4:21:30| have a two-thirds vote to add it back to the agenda. I don't think he wants to accept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15690)|
| 4:21:34| the amendment. No, actually, I'm fine with it. Mr. Chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15694)|
| 4:21:38| the original motion was a 30-day postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15698)|
| 4:21:42| No, we have a substitute motion to defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15702)|
| 4:21:46| I'm just saying a friendly amendment that we extend it, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15706)|
| 4:21:50| there be a denial, but there be a 30-day extension. Deny the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15710)|
| 4:21:54| settlement agreement, but extend the current contract by 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15714)|
| 4:21:58| I'm okay with that. If my second's okay with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15718)|
| 4:22:02| Yes. Then we're fine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15722)|
| 4:22:06| with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15726)|
| 4:22:10| We have a substitute motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15730)|
| 4:22:14| Repeat the motion. The motion is to disapprove| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15734)|
| 4:22:18| the mediation and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15738)|
| 4:22:22| the 30-day extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15742)|
| 4:22:26| Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15746)|
| 4:22:30| I guess my problem is with just 30 days is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15750)|
| 4:22:34| the consequences if this were to pass, that the mediation were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15754)|
| 4:22:38| to fail. I would assume that if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15758)|
| 4:22:42| the mediation fails, then we're not going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15762)|
| 4:22:46| approve the next item, which is the ground lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15766)|
| 4:22:50| In which case, we need to put this back out to bid, which means| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15770)|
| 4:22:54| we need more than just 30 days. I think we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15774)|
| 4:22:58| need probably somewhere, Bruce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15778)|
| 4:23:02| or whoever purchasing, who could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15782)|
| 4:23:06| answer, how long would we need in order to re-bid this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15786)|
| 4:23:10| Quite frankly, I think we would need to re-bid it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15790)|
| 4:23:14| At least two months. I would think at least two months, if not four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15794)|
| 4:23:18| Maybe even six. So instead of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15798)|
| 4:23:22| just simply extending it 30 days and then more than likely having to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15802)|
| 4:23:26| back and vote on it again, how long do you think we would need in order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15806)|
| 4:23:30| to re-bid this if this contract were not to be accepted today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15810)|
| 4:23:34| I would say a minimum of three months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15814)|
| 4:23:38| If you could, Mark, Commissioner Harmon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15818)|
| 4:23:42| if you could maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15822)|
| 4:23:46| extend it for a few more months so that we could go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15826)|
| 4:23:50| another re-bid process if this were to pass that we've denied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15830)|
| 4:23:54| this. Because I think it makes sense that if we deny it, then we're going to have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15834)|
| 4:23:58| re-bid it and we have to have the time to re-bid it. Or unless the number two bidder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15838)|
| 4:24:02| would do it month to month. Well, I think it's best to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15842)|
| 4:24:06| try to just go back, re-bid it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15846)|
| 4:24:10| If we're not going to give it to them this time around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15850)|
| 4:24:14| we need to re-bid it and see if we just can't continue on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15854)|
| 4:24:18| until we have a new contractor out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15858)|
| 4:24:22| whether it's NRR through the re-bid process or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15862)|
| 4:24:26| someone else. Because we don't know if it would be Mr. Graves'| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15866)|
| 4:24:30| contract. At least he's going to give us some money. Yes. I'd be perfectly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15870)|
| 4:24:34| willing to accept, rather than a 30-day, a 90-day or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15874)|
| 4:24:38| 120-day if that is the period necessary to re-bid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15878)|
| 4:24:42| I'd be perfectly happy to accept it as a friendly amendment. Which one are you wanting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15882)|
| 4:24:46| Commissioner Harmon? 120.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15886)|
| 4:24:50| That works for me. 120. I'm okay with that. Does the second agree to it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15890)|
| 4:24:54| Yes. We have a substitute motion on the floor to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15894)|
| 4:24:58| disapprove and have 120 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15898)|
| 4:25:02| extension. Are we ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15902)|
| 4:25:06| Do we need to ask the contractor if he's willing to accept extension?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15906)|
| 4:25:10| They can turn it down on their own. I guess there's no need in me kidding myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15910)|
| 4:25:14| I guess we need a roll call vote. Starting in the ninth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15914)|
| 4:25:18| Now, this vote is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15918)|
| 4:25:22| to deny. To deny. I would be voting to deny,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15922)|
| 4:25:26| correct? Yes, aye is to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15926)|
| 4:25:30| No is to approve. All it would do is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15930)|
| 4:25:34| turn down and we'd have to go back to approving it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15934)|
| 4:25:38| But at this point, we can't do that. We can't change, have another substitute motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15938)|
| 4:25:42| on the affirmative, so if it fails, we would actually have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15942)|
| 4:25:46| come back a second time. Or actually we'd go back to the original| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15946)|
| 4:25:50| maker of the motion, which is to defer for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15950)|
| 4:25:54| Or another substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15954)|
| 4:25:58| Commissioner Pinkston? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15958)|
| 4:26:02| Commissioner DeFries? Aye. Commissioner Wright? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15962)|
| 4:26:06| Commissioner Moore? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15966)|
| 4:26:10| Commissioner Smith? Aye. Commissioner Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15970)|
| 4:26:14| Pass. Commissioner Roundtree?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15974)|
| 4:26:18| No. Commissioner Briggs? Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15978)|
| 4:26:22| Liz Hode? Yes. Commissioner Hammond? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15982)|
| 4:26:26| Commissioner Daniels?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15986)|
| 4:26:30| Commissioner Daniels?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15990)|
| 4:26:34| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15994)|
| 4:26:38| Commissioner Davis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=15998)|
| 4:26:42| Yes. Commissioner Oven Harman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16002)|
| 4:26:46| Pass. Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16006)|
| 4:26:50| Norman? No. Commissioner Kampen? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16010)|
| 4:26:54| Commissioner Mark Harmon? Yes. Commissioner Strickland?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16014)|
| 4:26:58| No. Commissioner McKenzie? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16018)|
| 4:27:02| Pass. Wish to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16022)|
| 4:27:06| What pass or vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16026)|
| 4:27:10| I got three passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16030)|
| 4:27:14| Mr. Harman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16034)|
| 4:27:18| Mr. Harman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16038)|
| 4:27:22| No, we didn't pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16042)|
| 4:27:26| Do you wish to vote? I don't want to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16046)|
| 4:27:30| Mr. Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16050)|
| 4:27:34| Yeah, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16054)|
| 4:27:38| Commissioner Moore? Pass. Wish to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16058)|
| 4:27:46| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16066)|
| 4:27:50| Motion fails 6-9-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16070)|
| 4:27:54| Mr. Chair, I'd like to introduce a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16074)|
| 4:27:58| Go ahead. To approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16078)|
| 4:28:02| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16082)|
| 4:28:10| Was that Norman and McKenzie? Yeah, McKenzie and Norman, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16090)|
| 4:28:14| Are there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16094)|
| 4:28:18| Starting in the first district. Wait, wait, wait. What's up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16098)|
| 4:28:22| We've got David. Is David Wright's motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16102)|
| 4:28:26| Are we here in the 30 day? No, we have another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16106)|
| 4:28:30| substitute motion since that first substitute motion failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16110)|
| 4:28:34| Commissioner McKenzie had another substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16114)|
| 4:28:38| It was to approve. To approve. And you seconded it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16118)|
| 4:28:42| To approve the mediated settlement. Right, and you seconded it. And Mr. Chairman, my light was on first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16122)|
| 4:28:46| Well, I didn't see any lights at first. That's the reason I was getting ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16126)|
| 4:28:50| It was, it was. You mean your light was on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16130)|
| 4:28:54| I didn't see it. I just happened to be looking that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16134)|
| 4:28:58| This is just a point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16138)|
| 4:29:02| of order and I'll have to ask this. If a substitute motion fails, can someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16142)|
| 4:29:06| make another substitute motion before we vote on the original? That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16146)|
| 4:29:10| We can do substitute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16150)|
| 4:29:14| motions all night long. Let's hope not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16154)|
| 4:29:18| Commissioner Luthor. I was asking the law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16158)|
| 4:29:22| if this motion, the substitute motion, which is to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16162)|
| 4:29:26| approve, does not pass, then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16166)|
| 4:29:30| do we go back to the original motion, which is to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16170)|
| 4:29:34| defer for 30 days that Commissioner Wright brought forth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16174)|
| 4:29:38| Do we go back to it or since we are on the original| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16178)|
| 4:29:42| does it fail or do we go back to the deferral?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16182)|
| 4:29:46| Unfortunately, I don't see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16186)|
| 4:29:50| what you would have to defer. If you vote this down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16190)|
| 4:29:54| that's the end of the matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16194)|
| 4:29:58| Well, I guess what I'm saying is because we had a number of passes and it takes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16198)|
| 4:30:02| ten votes to pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16202)|
| 4:30:06| We may not have more no's but we don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16206)|
| 4:30:10| enough yes's so it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16210)|
| 4:30:14| ends up failing. That's right and the contractor is through at the end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16214)|
| 4:30:18| of the month and we face the possibility of litigation and on and on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16218)|
| 4:30:22| and on. Mr. Law Director, I don't think that was the question before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16222)|
| 4:30:26| Sorry for speaking out of turn here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16226)|
| 4:30:30| but I think the question was simply if this substitute motion fails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16230)|
| 4:30:34| don't we go back to the original Dave Wright motion to defer 30 days? No, what are you going to defer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16234)|
| 4:30:38| The matter before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16238)|
| 4:30:42| The matter before you will have been voted on and it will have been voted down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16242)|
| 4:30:46| if what you're suggesting is that we would then revert back to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16246)|
| 4:30:50| the first motion to defer. There's nothing left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16250)|
| 4:30:54| That's why I asked the question because normally when a motion fails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16254)|
| 4:30:58| you go back, a substitute motion fails, you go back to the original motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16258)|
| 4:31:02| but since the original motion is a deferral and the substitute motion is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16262)|
| 4:31:06| because it's sort of backwards that you have the motion and the affirmative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16266)|
| 4:31:10| as a substitute motion. Mr. Law Director, it may be that my motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16270)|
| 4:31:14| a couple of hours ago was flawed and I should have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16274)|
| 4:31:18| asked that if the current contractor would accept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16278)|
| 4:31:22| a 30-day extension that we defer for 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16282)|
| 4:31:26| and I amend my motion to state that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16286)|
| 4:31:30| Well, I guess you could ask that question while we're still debating this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16290)|
| 4:31:34| motion. We've not had a call yet so we're not, debate's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16294)|
| 4:31:38| over. And you could find out if they would be willing to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16298)|
| 4:31:42| that. Maybe the maker of the substitute motion will change his motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16302)|
| 4:31:46| and everybody can withdraw and we could start all over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16306)|
| 4:31:50| I'll talk about it about four or five minutes. No, let's not talk about it. I'm just talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16310)|
| 4:31:54| as far as making a motion. I'm talking about in 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16314)|
| 4:31:58| And we'd have to have whoever seconded my motion to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16318)|
| 4:32:02| agree to the asking of the contractor to extend his work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16322)|
| 4:32:06| for 30 days. Right now we have a substitute motion on the floor to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16326)|
| 4:32:10| I guess, Mr. Law Director, can he withdraw| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16330)|
| 4:32:14| his original motion to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16334)|
| 4:32:18| defer? He can't do that with a substitute motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16338)|
| 4:32:22| It's not going to make any difference. What you have before you is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16342)|
| 4:32:26| motion to approve. And if that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16346)|
| 4:32:30| fails, this resolution fails. And then you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16350)|
| 4:32:34| the consequences that we've discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16354)|
| 4:32:38| ad nauseum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16358)|
| 4:32:42| Mr. Chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16362)|
| 4:32:46| for hours we've talked about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16366)|
| 4:32:50| and I think three important pieces of information now lay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16370)|
| 4:32:54| in front of us about the issue. First, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16374)|
| 4:32:58| independent counsel that looked at the lawsuit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16378)|
| 4:33:02| that's facing the county thinks that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16382)|
| 4:33:06| that lawsuit will be dismissed. I think we've paid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16386)|
| 4:33:10| him good money to give us that opinion. And I appreciate his opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16390)|
| 4:33:14| because I'm not a lawyer. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16394)|
| 4:33:18| Second, I think that we as commission ask for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16398)|
| 4:33:22| mediated settlement. And we've received that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16402)|
| 4:33:26| And then last,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16406)|
| 4:33:30| it looks like it's a shared seat right now, but we have the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16410)|
| 4:33:34| giving us their best advice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16414)|
| 4:33:38| about what we should do as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16418)|
| 4:33:42| people representing, as this commission sitting and representing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16422)|
| 4:33:46| the people of Knox County. I made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16426)|
| 4:33:50| some statement earlier this evening about I thought there were other pieces of information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16430)|
| 4:33:54| that kept coming before us. And I believe Mr. Bosch brought a piece of information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16434)|
| 4:33:58| a moment ago that I didn't make a note about but appeared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16438)|
| 4:34:02| to be another piece of new information. I think we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16442)|
| 4:34:06| talked about it long enough. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16446)|
| 4:34:10| if I need to withdraw my motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16450)|
| 4:34:14| to ask the contractor to continue to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16454)|
| 4:34:18| for another month while we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16458)|
| 4:34:22| defer it for 30 days, if I need to withdraw that motion in deference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16462)|
| 4:34:26| to a new motion that we approve, I'll do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16466)|
| 4:34:30| No, you don't have to withdraw at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16470)|
| 4:34:35| Thank you. Commissioner Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16475)|
| 4:34:39| Yes, I just had a question for the law department with regard to something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16479)|
| 4:34:43| Mr. Bosch had said about our partnership agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16483)|
| 4:34:47| with NRR and any sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16487)|
| 4:34:51| conflict that that can have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16491)|
| 4:34:55| Can you please address that and the liability concerns with regard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16495)|
| 4:34:59| to that? That's what really I think is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16499)|
| 4:35:03| concerning me with regard to this mediated settlement and with regard to our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16503)|
| 4:35:07| contract. All three of us were reaching for the mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16507)|
| 4:35:11| With all due respect to what you've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16511)|
| 4:35:15| heard, some of it is totally inaccurate. Our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16515)|
| 4:35:19| agreement or any agreement on the mediation, that is not going to release| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16519)|
| 4:35:23| either Knox County or NRRT from a claim by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16523)|
| 4:35:27| a third party. Furthermore, the scope of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16527)|
| 4:35:31| release covers contract liability issues. If you've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16531)|
| 4:35:35| some other secondary tort or environmental claim| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16535)|
| 4:35:39| issue, there are all kinds of other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16539)|
| 4:35:43| legal remedies that those parties have directly against all parties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16543)|
| 4:35:47| that this is just way out of the scope of this mediation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16547)|
| 4:35:51| You've got legal counsel that can deal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16551)|
| 4:35:55| with those issues, but it is just not the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16555)|
| 4:35:59| If you've got a third party claim against NRRT or against| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16559)|
| 4:36:03| county or both, they're still claims. And this mediation doesn't resolve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16563)|
| 4:36:07| that. Okay. Thank you for answering that, Mr. Farmer. Then I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16567)|
| 4:36:11| have to agree with Commissioner Wright. We have really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16571)|
| 4:36:15| asked a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16575)|
| 4:36:19| of NRR. And every time that they have produced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16579)|
| 4:36:23| documents, they have been here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16583)|
| 4:36:27| and I believe that they have acted in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16587)|
| 4:36:31| good faith. And I believe that this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16591)|
| 4:36:35| needs to, you know, we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16595)|
| 4:36:39| the harshest critic in Commissioner Moore in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16599)|
| 4:36:43| mediated settlement. And he spoke very eloquently the other day in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16603)|
| 4:36:47| favor of this. And I have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16607)|
| 4:36:51| honor the hard work of the law department and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16611)|
| 4:36:55| I will be voting in favor to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16615)|
| 4:36:59| Commissioner Briggs. Just very quickly, one of the concerns has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16619)|
| 4:37:03| any liability or who will take the liability if there's a problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16623)|
| 4:37:07| against natural resources. When the original contract was signed, there was a $100,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16627)|
| 4:37:11| performance bond. If something occurred out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16631)|
| 4:37:15| is that part of this contract over the next three years or not? I guess I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16635)|
| 4:37:19| addressing this to the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16639)|
| 4:37:23| My understanding was that the performance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16643)|
| 4:37:27| bond had been released. Am I correct about that, Mr. Weitrich?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16647)|
| 4:37:31| That is correct. Typically the performance bond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16651)|
| 4:37:35| is to make sure the contractor is going to do what they say they're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16655)|
| 4:37:39| The county's exposure out there, if the contractor were just to walk off the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16659)|
| 4:37:43| is fairly minimal. There's quite a bit of product out there that's got a tremendous amount of value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16663)|
| 4:37:47| So the performance bond was released in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16667)|
| 4:37:51| the first phase of this contract. I think after the contract would allow it to be released,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16671)|
| 4:37:55| it was released. And I really don't see a necessity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16675)|
| 4:37:59| in having the same contractor post a performance bond doing the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16679)|
| 4:38:03| work they've been doing. I guess the question is, and I really don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16683)|
| 4:38:07| believe that this occurred, but let's say there was ash| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16687)|
| 4:38:11| buried out there that has arsenic in it or there was class B product| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16691)|
| 4:38:15| that you're supposed to keep on the pad that we found out was buried out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16695)|
| 4:38:19| and someone ended up suing. Who would be liable for that? Would it be the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16699)|
| 4:38:23| or Natural Resources if we approved this agreement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16703)|
| 4:38:27| Mr. Briggs, I imagine that we would, or excuse me, Dr. Briggs, I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16707)|
| 4:38:31| in that scenario I can't imagine that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16711)|
| 4:38:35| Natural Resources Recovery and Knox County would not be joint defendants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16715)|
| 4:38:39| I believe we would be both named and anybody else that a plaintiff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16719)|
| 4:38:43| could name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16723)|
| 4:38:47| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16727)|
| 4:38:51| I'm Diana Popp, the wife of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16731)|
| 4:38:55| gentleman that spoke. We share 1,000 feet fence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16735)|
| 4:38:59| line with that facility. I don't know how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16739)|
| 4:39:03| in the world you would want to continue having a relationship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16743)|
| 4:39:07| with a company that has violated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16747)|
| 4:39:11| the trust of the people. I came here to talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16751)|
| 4:39:15| about having some illness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16755)|
| 4:39:19| that's apparently not relevant. What I want to address is this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16759)|
| 4:39:23| material, tons of it, that appeared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16763)|
| 4:39:27| the first in 05 that was removed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16767)|
| 4:39:31| from the stream of materials they were processing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16771)|
| 4:39:35| and piled high, 30 feet high| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16775)|
| 4:39:39| multiple piles, 60 feet from our fence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16779)|
| 4:39:43| line, 200 feet from our house, 250| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16783)|
| 4:39:47| feet from our well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16787)|
| 4:39:51| As my husband explained, they did ultimately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16791)|
| 4:39:55| flatten it, but then in the last two years more has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16795)|
| 4:39:59| appeared. Why did they remove this material| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16799)|
| 4:40:03| from their stream of processing, put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16803)|
| 4:40:07| it on the most remote part of that property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16807)|
| 4:40:11| It's an oblong piece of property. The ponds are far| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16811)|
| 4:40:15| to the left. And this stuff is as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16815)|
| 4:40:19| close to our house as they could possibly put it. Why did they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16819)|
| 4:40:23| remove it? Why did they not process it so they could sell it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16823)|
| 4:40:27| It has to have value. And why are they continuing to put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16827)|
| 4:40:31| that stuff there in perpetuity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16831)|
| 4:40:35| What is in it? And we have asked and never been told.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16835)|
| 4:40:39| Except we do know that there is fly ash in it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16839)|
| 4:40:43| which has arsenic in it, which could have contributed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16843)|
| 4:40:47| to one of my health problems. The fact that that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16847)|
| 4:40:51| well water assay came back negative is irrelevant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16851)|
| 4:40:55| because what we need to know is what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16855)|
| 4:40:59| was in that well four years ago. And we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16859)|
| 4:41:03| did not know at that time that we needed to test it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16863)|
| 4:41:07| that there may be a problem with it because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16867)|
| 4:41:11| county officials refused to inform us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16871)|
| 4:41:15| that there may be a problem. So the very fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16875)|
| 4:41:19| that the well was tested this week and it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16879)|
| 4:41:23| came back, they say, clean, they did not test for arsenic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16883)|
| 4:41:27| I asked the gentleman today. They did not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16887)|
| 4:41:31| test for arsenic. We do not have our analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16891)|
| 4:41:35| back yet because the arsenic analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16895)|
| 4:41:39| is still being made. But why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16899)|
| 4:41:43| is that material, has it been isolated from all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16903)|
| 4:41:47| the other processing and left to just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16907)|
| 4:41:51| decay across the fence from us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16911)|
| 4:41:55| And I feel that that kind of information needs to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16915)|
| 4:41:59| looked at. We need to have an assay on that material| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16919)|
| 4:42:04| and ask why was it not processed and sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16924)|
| 4:42:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16928)|
| 4:42:12| Thank you. Commissioner Pinkston. Yes, this is a question for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16932)|
| 4:42:16| law director. John, back in December| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16936)|
| 4:42:20| of 06, I put a resolution before this board here, this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16940)|
| 4:42:24| commission, some of the other commissioners on here at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16944)|
| 4:42:28| time. Knox County could not do business with people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16948)|
| 4:42:32| that owed us money. That was passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16952)|
| 4:42:36| And for the last 19 months, we've been doing business with a company that owes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16956)|
| 4:42:40| us money. Now, how do we have any safeguards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16960)|
| 4:42:44| on this resolution? I know we're not doing business right now with people that owe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16964)|
| 4:42:48| us money. Could you tell us what we can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16968)|
| 4:42:52| to bring this forth to light for this body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16972)|
| 4:42:56| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16976)|
| 4:43:00| If| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16980)|
| 4:43:04| disagreement is accepted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16984)|
| 4:43:08| and we strongly urge you to accept it, then they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16988)|
| 4:43:12| won't owe us any money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16992)|
| 4:43:16| If you want to go back to your resolution, I'd have to look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=16996)|
| 4:43:20| at it, Commissioner, and see what the details of it were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17000)|
| 4:43:24| and see whose responsibility it would be to bring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17004)|
| 4:43:28| that to your attention. I'd certainly like to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17008)|
| 4:43:32| because, like I say, we've did business with these people here for 19 months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17012)|
| 4:43:36| and they've owed Knox County money. And the resolution was we were not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17016)|
| 4:43:40| to do business with anyone. We couldn't do business with anyone that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17020)|
| 4:43:44| owed the county money. And there may be other people out here like that that we don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17024)|
| 4:43:48| about right now that owes us money that we're still doing business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17028)|
| 4:43:52| with. And there needs to be some way that this commission knows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17032)|
| 4:43:56| I'm not sure how that was defined. If it was left undefined,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17036)|
| 4:44:00| you know, there needs to be much more definition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17040)|
| 4:44:04| to that than just somebody that owes us money. I mean, that could be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17044)|
| 4:44:08| anyone on a month-to-month basis who owes Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17048)|
| 4:44:12| money. I'm not sure who it is that would make that determination either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17052)|
| 4:44:16| Certainly finance would need to be involved and others as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17056)|
| 4:44:20| Well, I'd certainly like some answer on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17060)|
| 4:44:24| because, you know, this has gone on too long with them owing us money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17064)|
| 4:44:28| Commissioner, can I make one point along that line that we have advanced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17068)|
| 4:44:32| the notion that the county appoints someone from purchasing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17072)|
| 4:44:36| or finance, whichever department is most appropriate, to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17076)|
| 4:44:40| monitor this contract. I mean, we don't want there to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17080)|
| 4:44:44| not be any concern within commission that the money is not flowing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17084)|
| 4:44:48| And there will be payments under this agreement. I understand that. I'm not just talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17088)|
| 4:44:52| your company, but we may have 20 more out here like this that owe us money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17092)|
| 4:44:56| We need to know if they owe Knox County money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17096)|
| 4:45:00| Commissioner DeFries. Yes, we've been discussing this for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17100)|
| 4:45:04| long time and I just wanted everybody to remember that in this mediated settlement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17104)|
| 4:45:08| it does state that Knox County has diligently investigated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17108)|
| 4:45:12| and reviewed the various recent third-party allegations that products produced by NRR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17112)|
| 4:45:16| are somehow unsafe or present health risks and believes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17116)|
| 4:45:20| that these allegations should be unfounded and without merit. So I just wanted the commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17120)|
| 4:45:24| to remember that if you're voting for this mediated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17124)|
| 4:45:28| settlement, you are agreeing that those are all unfounded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17128)|
| 4:45:32| and without merit and it will probably go no further. Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17132)|
| 4:45:36| We have a substitute motion on the floor to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17136)|
| 4:45:44| We need a roll call vote. Where did we go last time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17144)|
| 4:45:48| Let's go ahead and end the first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17148)|
| 4:45:52| Commissioner McKenzie. Aye. Commissioner Strickland. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17152)|
| 4:45:56| Commissioner Mark Harmon. No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17156)|
| 4:46:00| Commissioner Campin. Yes. Commissioner Norman. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17160)|
| 4:46:04| Commissioner Ivan Harman. Yes. Commissioner Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17164)|
| 4:46:08| Yes. Commissioner Daniels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17168)|
| 4:46:12| I want clarification from the chairman on exactly what we're voting for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17172)|
| 4:46:16| Approval of the mediated settlement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17176)|
| 4:46:24| This also approves the contract, too, doesn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17184)|
| 4:46:28| It doesn't? That would be a separate vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17188)|
| 4:46:36| What did Daniels say? He passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17196)|
| 4:46:40| Could you talk into the microphone for everyone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17200)|
| 4:46:44| Commissioner Stone. No. Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17204)|
| 4:46:48| Yes. Commissioner Roundtree. Yes. Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17208)|
| 4:46:52| Yes. Commissioner Smith. No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17212)|
| 4:46:56| Commissioner Moore. Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17216)|
| 4:47:00| Commissioner Wright. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17220)|
| 4:47:04| Commissioner DeVries. No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17224)|
| 4:47:08| Commissioner Pinkston. No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17228)|
| 4:47:12| Does any pass wish to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17232)|
| 4:47:16| Does any pass wish to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17236)|
| 4:47:20| Pass votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17240)|
| 4:47:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17244)|
| 4:47:32| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17252)|
| 4:47:36| Motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17256)|
| 4:47:40| 9-6-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17260)|
| 4:47:48| We have an original motion to defer for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17268)|
| 4:47:52| I think that question is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17272)|
| 4:47:56| moving at this point, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17276)|
| 4:48:00| No. You made a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17280)|
| 4:48:04| That's what we just voted on, my substitute, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17284)|
| 4:48:08| We do have an original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17288)|
| 4:48:12| So far we've succeeded in both denying and approving the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17292)|
| 4:48:16| I think the only thing left is delaying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17296)|
| 4:48:20| Our law director spoke on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17300)|
| 4:48:24| John, do you want to speak on it again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17304)|
| 4:48:28| The vote that you just took| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17308)|
| 4:48:32| effectively denied the resolution. There is nothing left to vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17312)|
| 4:48:36| on on this matter tonight. It's time to call the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17316)|
| 4:48:40| resolution. The next resolution is for the lease agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17320)|
| 4:48:44| with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17324)|
| 4:48:48| to approve the lease agreement. There's nothing left| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17328)|
| 4:48:52| for that original motion. This was a substitute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17332)|
| 4:48:56| motion. The motion failed. The motion went to the substance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17336)|
| 4:49:00| of the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17340)|
| 4:49:04| That's the end of the matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17344)|
| 4:49:08| Everyone understand that? Yes, Mr. Chairman. I think a lot of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17348)|
| 4:49:12| understand, but I think there are some people concerned about upcoming litigation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17352)|
| 4:49:16| and things they were asking for. If they find out in the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17356)|
| 4:49:20| 30 days, they may be in favor of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17360)|
| 4:49:24| The option is you can suspend the rules. You can add this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17364)|
| 4:49:28| to the commission agenda to extend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17368)|
| 4:49:32| the current contract for as long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17372)|
| 4:49:36| as you desire. You can do that. Correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17376)|
| 4:49:40| but if someone on the prevailing side asks for a motion to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17380)|
| 4:49:44| reconsider, that's another option as well, isn't it? It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17384)|
| 4:49:48| Take two-thirds to put it back on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17388)|
| 4:49:52| No. Or is it a simple majority?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17392)|
| 4:49:56| Just a simple majority, Mr. Law Director? Yes. I thought it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17396)|
| 4:50:00| always been two-thirds. I thought it was two-thirds also. It's two-thirds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17400)|
| 4:50:04| if you wish to add an item to the agenda. Yes, sir. You're right about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17404)|
| 4:50:08| If there's someone on the prevailing side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17408)|
| 4:50:12| which was to deny that wishes to reconsider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17412)|
| 4:50:16| that motion, and it can be seconded by anyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17416)|
| 4:50:20| that motion has to be made at this meeting and it takes a majority vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17420)|
| 4:50:24| I was on the prevailing side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17424)|
| 4:50:28| to deny, so I'll make a motion to reconsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17428)|
| 4:50:32| Can that motion be amended to include what Commissioner Wright was talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17432)|
| 4:50:36| You're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17436)|
| 4:50:40| reconsider and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17440)|
| 4:50:44| there could be any number of motions made. There could. There could be any number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17444)|
| 4:50:48| of motions made. Yes, sir. Then I think that the proper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17448)|
| 4:50:52| strategy at this point is for me to request a reconsideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17452)|
| 4:50:56| All right. There needs to be a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17456)|
| 4:51:00| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17460)|
| 4:51:04| Now the resolution is back before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17464)|
| 4:51:08| We're going to only vote on the reconsideration, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17468)|
| 4:51:12| That's true. That's true. The motion to reconsider this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17472)|
| 4:51:16| has been properly motioned and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17476)|
| 4:51:20| Does everyone get to vote? To reconsider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17480)|
| 4:51:24| this resolution. If this fails, it can't come back up again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17484)|
| 4:51:28| for a year, is that correct? No. By your rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17488)|
| 4:51:32| I believe it's 90 days. 90 days, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17492)|
| 4:51:36| If the rules can be suspended with a two-thirds vote. I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17496)|
| 4:51:40| I just want to be sure that it can't come up like next month again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17500)|
| 4:51:44| So a motion to reconsider brings it literally back up for discussion? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17504)|
| 4:51:48| And at that point someone of this body, just theoretically, just hypothetically speaking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17508)|
| 4:51:52| could put in an amendment to something like Commissioner Wright talked about to defer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17512)|
| 4:51:56| Correct. Or any other amendments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17516)|
| 4:52:00| You need to vote on the motion to reconsider first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17520)|
| 4:52:04| Are there any questions? Did you want to speak on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17524)|
| 4:52:08| I'm sorry, I'll just take a second. I forgot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17528)|
| 4:52:12| to say it when I was up before, but the subject of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17532)|
| 4:52:16| lawsuits was raised. I want to remind you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17536)|
| 4:52:20| that this material that is sitting next to our fence line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17540)|
| 4:52:28| according to a letter that we received from TDEC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17548)|
| 4:52:32| is outside of the permit that this company is operating under.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17552)|
| 4:52:36| That is, they are doing something that is not permitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17556)|
| 4:52:40| and are in violation. And in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17560)|
| 4:52:44| handbook that TDEC has, I can't remember the name of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17564)|
| 4:52:48| right now, there is a daily cost for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17568)|
| 4:52:52| violations. And when we contact TDEC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17572)|
| 4:52:56| and raise, because we didn't get any satisfaction here, we will raise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17576)|
| 4:53:00| the issue that tons of material are being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17580)|
| 4:53:04| stored out of their permit and the daily fine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17584)|
| 4:53:08| is excessive. And it's been there since 05,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17588)|
| 4:53:12| January 05. And I just want you to know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17592)|
| 4:53:16| that is the case. And there may be costs associated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17596)|
| 4:53:20| with that. We are going to ask that TDEC force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17600)|
| 4:53:24| the facility to remove that material and we are also going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17604)|
| 4:53:28| ask that it be analyzed and ask the question, why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17608)|
| 4:53:32| is it in a remote area and removed from the facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17612)|
| 4:53:36| Thank you. Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17616)|
| 4:53:40| If we do vote to reconsider this, then I think it would be appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17620)|
| 4:53:44| to have someone from TDEC here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17624)|
| 4:53:48| I have a motion to reconsider, starting in the ninth. Roll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17628)|
| 4:53:52| call vote. Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17632)|

| 4:54:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17688)|
| 4:54:52| Does the pass wish to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17692)|
| 4:54:56| I'll abstain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17696)|
| 4:55:00| Motion passes 15-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17700)|
| 4:55:04| Resolution is back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17704)|
| 4:55:12| Open for a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17712)|
| 4:55:16| Commissioner Wright. It's been so long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17716)|
| 4:55:20| I've forgotten what my original motion was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17720)|
| 4:55:24| Any motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17724)|
| 4:55:28| It's open for any motion, and I recognize you, Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17728)|
| 4:55:32| And I, as I had stated before, would defer for 30| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17732)|
| 4:55:36| days if the contractor is willing to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17736)|
| 4:55:40| the 30-day extension. I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17740)|
| 4:55:44| A motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17744)|
| 4:55:48| Commissioner Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17748)|
| 4:55:52| What would you see the benefit of doing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17752)|
| 4:55:56| The thing that I forgot a moment ago about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17756)|
| 4:56:00| Dr. Doctor. The thing I forgot a moment ago about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17760)|
| 4:56:04| Mr. Bosch stating that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17764)|
| 4:56:08| we could face significant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17768)|
| 4:56:12| legal consequences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17772)|
| 4:56:16| if we did approve. There are several issues that have come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17776)|
| 4:56:20| tonight that have not been discussed before, and that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17780)|
| 4:56:24| the reason that I made the original motion to defer for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17784)|
| 4:56:28| So, Commissioner Wright, what do you want to see happen between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17788)|
| 4:56:32| now and then? Any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17792)|
| 4:56:36| more questions answered? It may be that we need to take a day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17796)|
| 4:56:40| like we've done today and just talk about nothing but green waste.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17800)|
| 4:56:44| Well, the other thing I think you brought up, Commissioner Wright, is the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17804)|
| 4:56:48| that the court's going to be deciding whether or not to toss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17808)|
| 4:56:52| the case or not tomorrow, and I'd give some chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17812)|
| 4:56:56| No, no, no, no, no, no, no. This settlement agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17816)|
| 4:57:00| doesn't have anything to do with the fraud claim that's been brought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17820)|
| 4:57:04| by Brad Mays. Well, in my mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17824)|
| 4:57:08| and I'm not going to speak for anybody else then, in my mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17828)|
| 4:57:12| there may be some things that come out of that case that may sway me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17832)|
| 4:57:16| one way or another. So the 30 days, I think, is a good idea. And that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17836)|
| 4:57:20| my thought in the original motion. But that's not going to happen anyway tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17840)|
| 4:57:24| It may not. There is not going to be a hearing tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17844)|
| 4:57:28| Let me state once again, for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17848)|
| 4:57:32| we've hired independent counsel to evaluate the false| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17852)|
| 4:57:36| claims case. We have reviewed their evaluation. We agree with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17856)|
| 4:57:40| it that the evidence is not there to support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17860)|
| 4:57:44| fraud or false claims. This is a contract case. We have contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17864)|
| 4:57:48| disputes. And what this commission needs to decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17868)|
| 4:57:52| in our respectful opinion is whether to settle those contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17872)|
| 4:57:56| disputes or not. And you had that same opinion, I think, in the termite| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17876)|
| 4:58:00| case. And in the termite case, you were wrong. Mr. Mays, we're not talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17880)|
| 4:58:04| the termite case. Mr. Mays, you haven't been recognized and you've had your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17884)|
| 4:58:08| five minutes. My litigation is over. Commissioner Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17888)|
| 4:58:12| Yes. Mr. Farmer, could you please clarify once| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17892)|
| 4:58:16| again for everyone that this mediation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17896)|
| 4:58:20| settlement does not preclude any sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17900)|
| 4:58:24| EPA concerns or any other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17904)|
| 4:58:28| My point here is the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17908)|
| 4:58:32| one the law director has made. This is a mediation that resolves contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17912)|
| 4:58:36| disputes. In answer to Mr. Larry Smith's problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17916)|
| 4:58:40| I respectfully disagree totally with Mr. Bosch's analysis. A third party,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17920)|
| 4:58:44| namely a landowner that was injured, could sue both the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17924)|
| 4:58:48| county and natural resources. So this does not preclude| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17928)|
| 4:58:52| that from happening at all? No, it does not. We still, they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17932)|
| 4:58:56| that right and this will not exclude them from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17936)|
| 4:59:00| Mr. Chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17940)|
| 4:59:04| Mr. Chairman, I withdraw my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17944)|
| 4:59:08| Hey, who wants to mulch?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17948)|
| 4:59:12| Y'all ready to go into zoning after a break?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17952)|
| 4:59:16| Or do y'all want someone to make a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17956)|
| 4:59:20| Well, I thought he made a motion to defer 30 days. Did you not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17960)|
| 4:59:24| I think we go on to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17964)|
| 4:59:28| I'd like to make a motion to approve. Commissioner McKenzie| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17968)|
| 4:59:32| would you like to? And I'm kind of with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17972)|
| 4:59:36| Commissioner Davis, but I need to ask the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17976)|
| 4:59:40| if we don't. I mean, and I think we need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17980)|
| 4:59:44| understand where we are right now. If we walk away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17984)|
| 4:59:48| from this right now, taking the action that we've taken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17988)|
| 4:59:52| to this point, what happens August the 1st?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17992)|
| 4:59:56| Do we shut the doors to the facility and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=17996)|
| 5:00:00| just wait on the lawsuits to start rolling in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=18000)|
| 5:00:04| Are there other options? I believe Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=18004)|
| 5:00:08| Greaves, did you not say you had been to that? I'm sorry, I was asking the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=18008)|
| 5:00:12| law department a question. I believe this man here stated what would happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=18012)|
| 5:00:16| But I was asking the law department, not the county law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=18016)|
| 5:00:20| John, do you want to answer? We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=18020)|
| 5:00:24| Where we are right now, I'm sorry, can you restate your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=18024)|
| 5:00:28| What happens at the point that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=18028)|
| 5:00:32| as far as our votes tonight, or today, if nothing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=18032)|
| 5:00:36| else happens, what happens August the 1st as it relates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=18036)|
| 5:00:40| to the green waste facility and Knox County's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=18040)|
| 5:00:44| path forward? We have no contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=18044)|
| 5:00:48| We have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=18048)|
| 5:00:52| potential litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=18052)|
| 5:00:56| And we start the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=18056)|
| 5:01:00| of trying to find a new contractor, but frankly it leaves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=18060)|
| 5:01:04| and I don't know if Mr. Weitrick is still around or where he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=18064)|
| 5:01:08| went, but it leaves them in a bind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=18068)|
| 5:01:12| As of right now, we would have no contractor August 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=18072)|
